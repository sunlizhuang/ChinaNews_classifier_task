Yiyang, China – Yiyang Rubber & Plastics Machinery Group has announced the delivery of an ‘experimental internal mixer’ to an unnamed client in Slovakia.

The GE5 mixer passed onsite commissioning in December last year, according to an announcement by the Chinese tire & rubber machinery maker.

Yiyang’s sixth internal mixer sale in the European market came just two months after the delivery of a GK190E internal mixer to a company in Italy, it noted.

The smallest model in Yiyang’s E series of internal mixers, the GE5 is said to feature meshing rotor, even mixing of sizing materials and low temperature rise.

According to the company, the unit is suitable for production in tire & rubber companies as well as in labs and technical centres.

All Yiyang mixers sold to the European market have thus far been from the E series, the company pointed out.

The company said it had incorporated special safety protection measures in the mixer in order to achieve the CE certification in the EU market.
