NEW YORK, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation has always been mutually beneficial and win-win by nature, Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, said here on Wednesday.

"As long as we bear in mind the fundamental interests of the two peoples and respect each other's dignity, sovereignty and core interests, no difficulty is too formidable to surmount," Cui said, addressing the 15th anniversary and Chinese Lunar New Year gala of China General Chamber of Commerce-U.S.A. in New York city.

Commenting on the phase-one economic and trade deal between the two countries, Cui said such a deal will be conducive to China, to the United States and to the whole world, especially in a highly complex and fluid international environment.

He added that facts have proved that for China and the United States, dialogue and consultation on the basis of equality and mutual respect will eventually lead to win-win outcomes.

Looking ahead, Cui said he hopes that China-U.S. relations will move forward in the right direction and in a sound and steady manner.

He pointed out that the two countries need to strengthen their strategic communication and work together for a better future.

Cui also called on the business communities of both sides to stay confident about the prospect for bilateral relations and to live up to the corporate social responsibility of supporting bilateral friendship and cooperation.
