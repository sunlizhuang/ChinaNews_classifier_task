MEXICO CITY - At least three Chinese automakers are preparing to produce vehicles in Mexico or expand existing operations, the Mexican ambassador to China said on Monday, in what would be a boost to one of the Latin American country's top export industries. Jose Luis Bernal, Mexico's ambassador to China, said that over the past year and a half his office has seen more interest from Chinese firms looking to make cars in Mexico.

Bernal, speaking at an event in Mexico City, listed Chongqing-based carmaker Changan, electric car maker BYD, and Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co, known as JAC, as actively eyeing production facilities in Mexico.
