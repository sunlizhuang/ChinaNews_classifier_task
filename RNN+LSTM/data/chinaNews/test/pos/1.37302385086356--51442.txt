ROE Visual will be at ISE on stand 12-F80

China/The Netherlands - In response to the current Coronavirus outbreak in China, ROE Visual has decided to take only its international teams to the ISE exhibition in Amsterdam and leave the team located at its headquarters in Shenzhen at home.

“There is no doubt that both the RAI and the ISE trade show organisation take all the necessary precautions to ensure that the trade show visit is safe for visitors, but part of that safety is in our own hands and we felt that we as a company should show our common responsibility and contribute in our own way,” states Jason Lu, general manager for ROE Visual.

“That is why we have decided to cancel the visit to ISE for all our Chinese-based staff. This was not an easy decision, but it’s made out of respect and care to all our visitors, clients and the overseas colleagues. We send our best wishes to everybody. Be safe and healthy.”

ROE Visual will be introducing a range of new products at ISE, all designed using the latest LED technologies.
