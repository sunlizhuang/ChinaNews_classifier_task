Local company, Langley Alloys, is on track for its best results ever after four years of continuous growth.

As a distributor of specialist alloys, the company was impacted by a downturn in the global oil and gas market, but broadening their product and service offering and developing sales in new markets has delivered increased turnover and profitability.

Since 2017, sales have more than doubled and seem set to continue towards the £20 million level. The company has invested more than £2 million in equipment and stocks to support increased sales, and seen staff numbers steadily rise from 23 to 40, with that number likely to increase further through 2020. In addition, new sites in Fenton and Longton have been opened to house new equipment and more stocks.

The high-value metals that Langley Alloys distributes are sold on a global basis – with customers from Brazil to Australia, and most countries in between. The Newcastle-under-Lyme site is the company's main location, but it also operates sites in the USA – Portland and Houston – and Singapore, which gives them the global reach that their larger multi-national customers demand.

Rodney Rice, business development director, said, “Our focus on a relatively narrow range of specialist alloys means that we have been able to develop a global reputation. It often surprises visitors to see consignments in our dispatch area for customers in South Korea, China and South Africa, in addition to all of Europe.

"Our sales team have been working hard to increase the reach of our business, so not only have we added to the internal sales team, but have made a conscious effort to get out and find customers in regions such as the Middle East and India.”

Langley Alloys feels like a young company, operating from its Newcastle-under-Lyme site for just 10 years. However, they can trace their history back more than 80 years, as a pioneer of the development of novel alloys.

Known as the 'home of Super Duplex', Langley Alloys has a clear focus on this particular family of alloys. The company developed the world’s first super duplex alloy in 1969, widely recognised as Ferralium® 255. This 25%Cr stainless steel is specified by leading oil companies for the production of downhole tooling, by pump and valve manufacturers and also for the production of high-strength fasteners. It was even used in the refurbishment of the Statue of Liberty in the 1980’s!

Langley Alloys is far from a single product company though, now carrying a range of nearly 20 different alloys that are used in some of the most aggressive environments. These high-performance stainless steels, nickel and copper alloys are widely used in the oil and gas industry, but also chemical processing, mining, water treatment, marine, fertiliser production and sub-sea applications.

Unlike other metal distributors, Langley Alloys also provides a number of value-added services, including in-house inspection and testing, supply chain management and review of complex customer specifications from its experienced team.

New locations in Fenton and Longport have been opened, partly to accommodate new first-stage CNC machining and deep-hole boring capabilities.

Richard Bulmer, operations director, commented, “Adding this machining capability has allowed us to bring more work in-house, rather than use external sub-contractors. Providing our metal bars in a shape closer to the customers’ requirements saves them time and money. It has been challenging at times, finding new staff, investing in expensive equipment and opening sites whilst supporting growth in our existing business, but is now making a positive contribution to our sales.”

Besides new sites and equipment, increased stocks and a growing team, Langley Alloys has now entered the market for piping and packages, using its market relationships to source and supply stainless steel and nickel alloy pipes, flanges and fittings to the global market. The focus remains on the same high-performance metals, but now means that it is as close to a one-stop shop for many of its customers as it is possible.
