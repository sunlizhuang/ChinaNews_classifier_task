The term soft power first time in 1990s was coined by Joseph Samul Nye who described it as “the ability to achieve goals through attraction rather than coercion”. Though Nye is widely regarded as the pioneer of soft power, he replicated the ideas of soft power from Chinese sixth century BC strategist Sun Tzu in his work named “Art of War” in which he described the skillfulness of war, where he taught the statecraft to win a war without waging the war. Another Chinese renowned philosopher Confucius also followed the trajectory of soft power in his leadership and said that “ruler is expected to demonstrate moral excellence, taking wise decisions on behalf of his subjects to keep the state secure and prosperous”.

By reading between the lines the Chinese foreign policy, one would say that China gives a great deal of significance to soft power implementing the doctrines of Sun Tzu and Confucius accordingly. China through soft power desires to show itself as a benign and responsible international actor. In this regard, William A. Callahan elaborates China’s three global spectacles such as Shanghai’s World Expo in 2010, the People’s Republic of China sixteenth anniversary celebrations in 2009 and Beijing’s Olympic Games in 2008. The bona fide objectives of organizing such international events in China are attributed to demonstrate itself as a hub of ancient wisdom and high technology that will pave the way for an alternative mode of progress for the world.

China, unlike the US has a peculiar soft power strategy in its peripheries particularly in South Asia trying to promote economic assistance, culture diplomacy and trade and development. It has built the University of Kelaniya in Sri Lanka (2007), Cts at Kathmandu University in Nepal (2006) and North South University in Bangladesh (2006) to promote Chinese language and culture. Most considerably, Confucius Institute (CI) built in Pakistan is the first CI in the Islamic world. CI in Pakistan conducts Chinese language courses offering PhD program of advanced courses.

China’s inclusive approach and its BRI initiative guaranteeing win-win situation for its trade partners, projecting its soft power provide a better opportunity to other states to jump on the Chinese bandwagon

China’s soft power has been increasing by leaps and bounds across the world supporting culture exchanges, sending its teachers and doctors broad, accommodating and welcoming students of other countries to study in China. Southeast Asian states are fascinated by Chinese soft power Chinese culture, calligraphy, cuisine, curios, cinema, art, herbal medicine, acupuncture are omnipresent in that particular region of the world. Young people of the aforementioned states are interested in Chinese films, television and pop music.

However, China being world’s second largest economy will use its economic leverage in projection of its soft power. China in South Asian region helped and aided smaller states such as Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka to accelerate their economic growth. China has also been assisting South Asian states in emergency, food and relief aids. Resultantly, it has a better image within South Asian states. David Schambaugh articulates that China has made a remarkable headway in using economy as soft power, granted $ 50 billion for the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) $40 billion for the Silk Road Economic Belt, $ 41 billion for the New Development Bank and $ 25 billion for the Maritime Silk Road. Above all, Beijing has pledged to invest approximately $ 4.8 trillion across the world in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Schambaugh further says that during the cold war two archrivals the US and USSR did not spend such great amount across the world as China alone is spending today.

Meanwhile, India is perceived by many commentators as a rival of China but that claim is incompatible with ground realities. China a staunch pursuer of soft power believes their rivalry is the brainchild of the British Empire aimed at perpetuating its imperial interests. China, thus, desires better ties with India, their bilateral annual trade has surpassed & 80 billion dollar. The Chinese ambassador to India Wei Wei in 2013 once said that “our geographical location binds us-so let us be good neighbors, good friends and good partners”

Presumably, China in the foreseeable future will strive in winning hearts and minds of the people by projecting its glorious past, great civilization and culture based on peace and harmony. China will inevitably disseminate Confucian philosophy of peace, love and harmony. Some Sinologists are of the view that China’s harmonious world order would be a spectacular model for the world’s harmony. Its soft power would be based on attraction and persuasion rather than force and coercion. In short, the US considering itself an orchestrator of win-win situation now itself violates its own doctrine and tilts towards protectionism and isolationism. On the other hand, China’s inclusive approach and its BRI initiative guaranteeing win-win situation for its trade partners, projecting its soft power provide a better opportunity to other states to jump on the Chinese bandwagon.
