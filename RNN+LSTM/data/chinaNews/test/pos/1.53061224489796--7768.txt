EAT: Your bite-sized guide to the best eats to be had in Beijing this week.

Until Jan 19: Pre-CNY deals at Pebbles

In what they are dubbing the "Juan" event, in the last week before it closes for Spring Festival, Pebbles is offering a slew of "Juan for Juan" (geddit?) deals. Until Jan 19, classic margaritas, palomas, Slow Boat draft beer, Coronas, and Jarritos soft drinks will be buy-one-get-one-free, while a different appetizer, main, and dessert will be either buy-one-get-one-free or half-price daily. They're also selling all-you-can-eat tacos and drinks as part of this weekend's fundraisers for the Australian wildfires, which you can read more about here.

New weekday lunch set at Zhazha Bistro

One of our favorite restaurant openings of 2019 was modern Guizhou-style eatery Zhazha Bistro and if you haven't already been yourself, now is a great time to head to their Qianmen-adjacent restaurant to try their new weekday lunch set. Priced at just RMB 48, choose from three different sets – pork hock with rice, veggie wraps with soft-boiled egg, or soup noodles with either beef or tofu balls – each of which comes with either a black coffee or a ginger tea. If you happen to miss lunch, from 2.30-5.30pm all dishes are 32 percent off.

Saigon Mama opens new location in Indigo Mall

Vietnamese noodle specialists Saigon Mama opened a third Beijing restaurant in Indigo Mall on Jan 12, bringing their highly-slurpable pho to the northeast side of the city for the first time. This is their 12th restaurant in China and to celebrate, they are offering both their Vietnamese drip coffee and their special egg rolls for just RMB 12 (usually RMB 35 and RMB 45, respectively). The offer is available for both dine-in and takeaway customers.

Daily dining deals at Pachapapi

Fend off the winter cold with a series of sunny daily specials from Pachapapi. On Monday it's "cholo night," with two-for-one offers on classic Peruvian dishes like antichuchos and ají de gallina. If you're a fan of their ceviche (the best in town in our opinion), be sure to head over on Wednesdays, when all ceviche (pictured above) and tiradito (sliced raw fish similar to a carpaccio) are two-for-one. If you work nearby, don't forget that they still have their traditional Peruvian lunch deal going (pictured at top) in which all dishes come with a free drink. See all the deals in this WeChat post from Pachapapi.

Thursdays: BOGOF burgers at Café de la Poste

Burgers? At Café de la Poste? We never thought we'd see the day. But the French restaurant has indeed decided to take on what is undoubtedly one of Beijing's favorite dishes, tempting diners with a buy-one-get-one-free deal on everything burger on Thursdays. Choose from four different varieties: beef burger with cheddar or blue cheese, cheese-stuffed chicken burger with barbecue sauce, "Le Savoyard" (a potato rosti with caramelized onions and cheese cream), or a veggie burger with quinoa and avocado cream.

You can also eat and drink for a cause this weekend as Beijing venues rally together to raise money for the communities affected by the devastating Australian wildfires.
