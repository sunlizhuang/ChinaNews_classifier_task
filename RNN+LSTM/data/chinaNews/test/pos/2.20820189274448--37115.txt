Ghana’s ambassador to China H.E Edward Boateng has assured the general public that Ghanaians living in China especially the Wuhan region are safe, this he attributed to their receptiveness to government lockdown procedures.



Speaking to host of ‘Epa Hoa Daben’ Kwame Afrifa Mensah on Happy FM via a telephone interview he said: ‘’ Ghanaians living in China are safe. There are about two hundred and eight (280) students in Wuhan and none of them has been infected with the coronavirus.’’

According to Ambassador Boateng, the student leadership in Wuhan have been very helpful and he is engaging them frequently to assist them when the need arises.

‘’I must commend the students in Wuhan, they have comported themselves very well, heeding every advice or instruction from the authorities and that has helped immensely.

It is true in a situation like this, there are economic and other implications but Ghanaians living in China have behaved very well’’ he said.

He also expressed optimism in the science experts working around the clock to find a lasting solution to the coronavirus outbreak.

‘’Chinese authorities are working to find an effective cure for the coronavirus outbreak, and I believe they will find a solution in the coming days. We are monitoring the situation and I am in constant contact with the government here in Ghana to assist us when we need it’’ he stated.

According to media reports, at least one hundred and six (106) people have died from a new coronavirus in China following an outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, forcing a government lockdown in almost twenty (20) cities that in effect has quarantined an estimated fifty-six (56) million people.

More than four thousand five hundred twenty (4,520) cases have been reported globally, most of them in China and especially in Wuhan and nearby cities in Hubei province.
