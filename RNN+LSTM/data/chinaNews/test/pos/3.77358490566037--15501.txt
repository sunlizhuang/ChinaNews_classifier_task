Limited-edition SK-II Facial Treatment Essence stars Mickey Mouse.

A simple frosted glass bottle has been a medium for various artists, who have collaborated in SK-II's limited-edition Facial Treatment Essence (FTE) series.

For instance, award-winning Taiwanese artist Huang Po-Chih fashioned floral motifs while New York-based Fantasista Utamaro designed manga motifs.

The latest collaboration is also related to animation as Disney's original Mickey Mouse appears on FTE's bottle, to mark the Lunar New Year.

The cartoon character became popular after starring in Steamboat Willie -- the first animation to feature synchronised music and sound effects -- released in November 1928. The cheerful anthropomorphic mouse still looks pretty young for his 90-something age.

This is in line with the story of SK-II's signature ingredient, Pitera, which is inspired by how elderly, wrinkled sake brewers had soft and youthful hands because they were constantly in contact with yeast used in the fermentation process.

From this observation, SK-II scientists researched on isolating a yeast strain for a natural fermentation process to obtain hydrating and anti-ageing Pitera.

Launched in December 1980, the SK-II skincare brand has hailed the FTE containing over 90% Pitera as its Miracle Water to achieve crystal clear skin.

The Year of the Rat limited edition features Mickey Mouse, seemingly slapping the FTE on his face, using the "pat pat" application method.

The skincare routine is honed by Chinese actress Tang Wei, who teaches TV host James Corden to "pat pat" in one of the "Pitera Masterclass" videos.
