SALT LAKE CITY — Public health workers in San Juan County say they are monitoring two travelers who recently returned to Utah’s southeastern corner from China and may have been exposed to novel coronavirus in that country.

The pair don’t now have the disease but are being evaluated in order to ensure they will be isolated and referred for medical care if they develop symptoms, officials with the San Juan Public Health and Utah Navajo Health System said in a statement.

“Based on the information currently known about the patients’ activities, there is no immediate health risk to the general public,” the statement says.

No details were provided about the two people who are being monitored or their travel to China. They are being instructed to record their temperature twice per day, watch for symptoms and stay away from gathering places. The health agencies said they are communicating daily with the pair.

To date, there are no confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in Utah. More information is available from the Utah Department of Health online at health.utah.gov/coronavirus.
