Large-format architecture and design books continue to land on store shelves near you because, well, no electronic version can do them justice.

The latest crop tackles topics in fresh, artistic ways with sumptuous photos that look both forward and back: Celia Forner focuses on bedrooms in her substantial new book; two others evaluate the work of Eileen Gray and Francis Sultana, both iconic designers in dramatically different ways. Michel Pastoureau and Here Designs take historical approaches to their subjects — the color “yellow” and ceramic tile, respectively; and designer Lisa Fine takes a more contemporary approach, displaying images that delight and inspire.

Here’s a roundup of new books in the architecture and design world.

“Bedtime: Inspirational Beds, Bedrooms and Boudoirs”

Edited by Celia Forner

Vendome; $60; 288 pp.

No example of a great bedroom is ignored in Celia Forner’s expansive book. You’ll see rooms with 18th-century Chinese daybeds by Thomas Chippendale, luxurious wall coverings and sumptuous bedding, and ornate boudoirs fit for a queen. One section is devoted to Hollywood, and most of those bedrooms were created for seduction, or at least to promote the mystique of actors such as Elizabeth Taylor, Vivienne Leigh or Ann-Margret. More unusual locations include a bedroom in a hotel created in restored caves, a Kenyan treehouse hotel, and beds in transparent, inflatable bubble tents in China.

“Eileen Gray: Her Life and Work”

By Peter Adam

Thames & Hudson; $39.95; 328 pp.

Eileen Gray was one of the most innovative and influential architects of her day, but unless you’ve studied design, you may not know a thing about this intelligent and complicated woman. A new biography by Peter Adam, who knew Gray in the last 14 years of her life, documents her work from the 1920s on, her relationships and even her largely overlooked artwork. A native of Ireland who grew up in London and later lived in Paris, Gray worked closely with Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and J.J.P. Oud. Many of her steel tube, chrome and glass furniture designs from the 1920s are considered as modern and stylish today as they were a century ago, and they’re still licensed for manufacture with Aram in the United Kingdom. Perhaps her most notable work was her radically modern E.1027 home that today is a French National Cultural Monument.

“Yellow: The History of a Color”

By Michel Pastoureau

Princeton University Press’ $39.95; 240 pp.

Michel Pastoureau continues his study of colors, following up on similar works about blue, black, green and red. Yellow, in its varied shades, has meant different things at different times and in different places. Pastoureau argues that even though many colors existed in nature, their use in society is a cultural construction, created, for example, for painting or dyeing and linked to ideas such as strength, power or even beauty. Ochre pigments were used on cave wall drawings in the Paleolithic era and gold was embraced later in the Neolithic, but both yellow and the precious metal — inextricably linked — hit their stride in the Greco-Roman period. Pastoureau’s book, a measured and scholarly approach, is filled with images of art and artifacts as well as the color’s interesting role in world history.

“The Tile Book: History, Pattern, Design”

By Here Design

Thames & Hudson; $29.95; 304 pp.

Ceramic tiles have been used as art and decoration since the Middle Ages, the time of their earliest mass production in 13th-century Europe. Here Design’s “The Tile Book” — produced in association with the Victoria and Albert Museum in London — offers a study in tile as it has been made and used worldwide. Organized chronologically, you see how tiles grew from simple designs for royals and religious buildings to more intricate works that covered whole walls or rooms with a mosaic effect. They progressed quickly to floral patterns or even groups of tiles that told stories, such as the tragic love story of Tristan and Iseult. Older tiles are beautiful for their detailed handwork and more modern images celebrate artisanal technique.

“Near & Far: Interiors I Love”

By Lisa Fine

Vendome; $60; 304 pp.

Textile designer Lisa Fine stretches way beyond her native Mississippi to tap into colors and patterns from Scandinavia, India, Turkey and the Near and Far East. Fine once lived in Paris and now splits her time between Dallas and New York, but her sense of beauty and home decoration began in her childhood home in Hattiesburg, one that was beautiful in a functional and comfortable way. Her book is filled with photos that represent her ideal of beautiful places — a tiled room in an Indian mausoleum; her mother’s Dallas apartment with furniture slip-covered in a blue-green chintz; the art studio of Scot Sarah Graham; an 18th-century Rococo manor house in Sweden; the homes of design icon Charlotte Moss.

“Francis Sultana: Designs & Interiors”

Edited by Bronwyn Cosgrave

Vendome; $60; 250 pp.

Browsing the pages of writer Bronwyn Cosgrave’s ode to her friend and mentor, Francis Sultana, is a peek into the brilliant mind of someone whose work is as much art as it is design. Sultana, a native of Malta, maintains a design studio in London, from which he creates avant-garde furniture and dreams up daring interiors for clients. The book spotlights the private homes and collections Sultana has handled, featuring his signature bold colors and shapes combined in surprising ways. If you’re not familiar with Sultana — a frequent name on the prestigious AD100 list — or his work, this book is sure to be a delightful surprise.

“100 Houses: Nature and Nurture”

Images Publishing; $40; 320 pp.

Don’t let “100 Houses” packaging as a sturdy paperback dissuade you from considering it a serious compilation of interesting design. Architects often begin their plans for any new building by assessing its location and the nature — or, sometimes, lack thereof — surrounding it. This book goes big on nature, including homes of all sizes and in all kinds of settings: mountains, bushland, seaside, plains and, of course, urban neighborhoods. Full floor plans accompany each project, showing architectural lines both inside and out.
