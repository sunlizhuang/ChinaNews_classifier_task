Leaders from one of Iowa’s largest ag entities, Landus Cooperative, have released statements praising last week’s signing of two major U.S. trade deals. The U.S. Senate voted 89-10 to approve the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a modernization of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). President Donald Trump has already indicated he is ready to sign it, which would be the last step before the USMCA is made law. Jim Carlson, president of the board of directors, says, “Our cooperative has been advocating for this agreement with our industry partners and thank our elected officials. Maintaining long-term, strong trade partnerships is imperative to the success of our more than 8,000 farmer-members across 26 Iowa counties.” The first phase of a trade agreement with China was also signed last week by President Trump. Chief Commodity Marketing Officer, Ron DeJongh, applauds this move forward. “This provides a first step toward a more fair and open trade agreement long term with the largest customer in the world. Our farmer-members are more successful when free and honest trade opportunities exist,” he says.
