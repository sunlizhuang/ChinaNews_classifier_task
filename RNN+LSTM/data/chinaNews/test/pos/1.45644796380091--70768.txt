According to SNI's Fisheries and Aquaculture Committee Chairman Carlos Milanovitch, those Peruvian shipments may reach US$3 billion in 2021.





The officer noted there are 15 ports that remain open in China such as: Shanghai, Qingdao, Ningbo, and Dalian, among others, through which Peruvian giant squid exports continue entering that market as usual.





Milanovitch anticipated that —despite the coronavirus situation— the fishery sector 's products aimed at human consumption will meet the set goal of increasing exports by more than 30%.





"We will increase our shipments from US$1.5 billion in 2019 to US$2 billion in 2020, and thanks to the competitiveness and productivity measures (…), shipments of high value-added fishery products are expected to reach some US$3 billion in 2021," he projected.
