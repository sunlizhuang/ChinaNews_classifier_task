On registration basis only

The Department of Information and International Relations of Central Tibetan Administration is convening Third Five-Fifty Youth Forum: Shaping Tibet’s Future, that will bring together a select group of 120 young Tibetans of the age group 20-35, from across the globe to discuss and deliberate on CTA’s Five-Fifty Vision.

The Five-Fifty Vision is that the Tibetan people will regain their freedom and dignity and that His Holiness the Dalai Lama will return to Tibet. This Vision motivates and shapes all of our activities.

The Five-Fifty Vision calls for resolving the issue of Tibet and Tibet’s political future in the next five years. We will strive to achieve this result in accordance with the Middle Way Approach. At the same time, we will devote substantial attention and resources to sustaining and strengthening the resilience of the Tibetan people inside and outside of Tibet, the Tibetan freedom struggle, and the Tibetan culture and identity for the next fifty years if need be.

The forum will be held in August in Dharamshala.
