Everyone is talking about CBD these days, and there’s really a lot of hype about what it can do. The really exciting thing about CBD vape is that there is so much research in the work that is pointing out that CBD may have many great benefits. No official claims can be made until all points are proven and certified by the FDA.

Disclaimer: Pure Hemp Shop makes no claims that CBD can cure, treat, or prevent any illnesses, whether that is mental, physical, or emotional. All data here was provided from customer experience with our products. If your pet has any serious medical issues we recommend you consult your veterinarian. Pure Hemp CBD Products are only designed to help promote an overall sense of wellness only.

In fact, CBD has been approved by the FDA for one medical use so far for patients of epilepsy.

Almost 1 In 5 CBD Users Prefer To Vape CBD Oil

And according to research, CBD vape is the second-most popular method of administering CBD.2

The reason why this article is so important is that CBD vape juice, e-liquids, and oils are currently an unregulated industry, and there is a lot that you need to know to be totally safe when vaping.

There are hundreds of different products on the market and each one is unique. But if you know what you’re looking for, you’ll make the healthiest choices. So let’s start with the different kinds of CBD oils and what they mean.

Cannabis CBD, Hemp CBD, And CBD Isolate: A Tale Of Three Oils

In this short section, we’re going to tell you the differences between these three different kinds of pure CBD oil’s: Cannabis CBD, Hemp CBD, and CBD Isolate.

Cannabis CBD is CBD that comes from the flowers and leaves of a marijuana plant of the Sativa variety. Usually, the plant has low or almost non-existent THC. However, there are some Cannabis CBD vaping oils that do have THC in them, so be warned!

Hemp CBD, on the other hand, comes from the flowers and leaves of hemp (not the seeds). Hemp is marijuana’s cousin, which is bred for its rich CBD content and has only trace amounts of THC. When you get Hemp CBD vape oil, you can be 100% sure it has only extremely tiny amounts of THC in it, if any at all.

CBD isolate is pure CBD oil that has been processed and refined to have ONLY CBD in it. With both cannabis and hemp CBD oil, you get phytocannabinoids, vitamins, minerals, natural terpenes, flavanols, and plant fats that come along with the CBD, because it’s natural.

Hemp and cannabis CBD are both forms of “full spectrum” CBD – which has actually been scientifically shown to provide more medical benefits than just CBD isolate by itself.3

CBD isolate is 99% pure CBD without any of the natural compounds so it doesn’t give you the “full spectrum” of health benefits.

Out of all of these, hemp oil is the preferred oil for experienced CBD users because:

Unlike some Cannabis-derived CBD oils, hemp CBD has no THC (less than 0.3%)

Unlike CBD isolate, hemp CBD gives you the “full spectrum” effect with a wide variety of terpenes and phytocannabinoids that help CBD work most effectively in your body

It still has a very high level of CBD and organic quality

Where Does Hemp Come From?

Thanks to recent legislation that officially legalized the farming of hemp in the United States, hemp is fast becoming one of the most exciting frontiers of American industry.

The US Farm Bill which was passed right at the beginning of 2019 finally legalized farming of this harmless, helpful, medicinal crop. Prior to that, growing hemp was federally illegal in the United States.

For the past 80 years, almost everything made of hemp was imported into the U.S. from Canada, China, India, and other countries in Eastern Europe and Asia. Some hemp was produced in the United States, but it was a risky crop to own. Until now.

The new US Farm Bill opens the floodgates for a huge number of American-based hemp farmers to get their crop off the ground and supply the huge demand for CBD in the US.

Home-Grown, Right Here On American Soil

The biggest difference between imported hemp and American–grown hemp is accountability.

Imported hemp can be tested and evaluated for its quality, but at the end of the day, you’ll never really know if it was genetically-modified, what kinds of pesticides were used on it, and so forth.

American-made hemp can be quality tested and controlled on a whole new level. That’s why we can say our hemp is Non-GMO, 100% organic, and has never had pesticides sprayed on it.

When our providers are close in the same country as us, we can do our due diligence by inspecting the quality of their hemp, and run tests like:

Soil quality tests

Thorough “every-ingredient” testing

Rigorous potency and purity standards

When our hemp is being grown in-country, we can make sure everything is top-notch. Which we just can’t do if we import our CBD. That’s why American-made hemp is better for you and why all of our hemp is made right here in the US of A.

What’s The Difference Between CBD Oil & CBD Vape Oil? And What Is E-Liquid?

There are a ton of different terms used in this industry to refer to different things. What is CBD oil referring to? What about CBD e-liquid? It’s very confusing so in this section, we want to clear up the confusion and tell you about what is in these things you are using and vaping.

It’s important to know what’s in CBD vape juice so that you can be prepared to choose the right ones for your health. So let’s get started!

“What Does It All Mean?”

CBD oil. CBD tincture. CBD vape oil. CBD E-Liquid. CBD vape juice. These are all names of CBD-based products. What do they all mean?

The short and sweet answer: anything with the word “vaping” or “e-liquid” (short for “electronic cigarette liquid”) is for vaping ONLY. Here are the varieties of vaping liquid:

CBD E-Liquid

CBD Vape Oil

CBD Vaping Liquid

CBD Vape Juice

CBD Vape Cartridge

These are all the same thing! These oils/liquids are made to vape by mixing special compounds into the oil that allows the CBD to vaporize and be carried into your lungs.

Most of the time they come pre-packaged in cartridges, but you can also get CBD vape oil in a dropper bottle that can be used with a more high-tech/custom CBD vape pen.

CBD oils & tinctures, on the other hand, are thicker oils that are meant to be dosed orally or sublingually. You can’t vape these oils, and you shouldn’t try! They will just burn.

Here’s What Is Actually IN CBD Vape Oil.

As just mentioned above, any CBD oil, juice, or liquid made for vaping has special components that make it thin enough to vaporize and enter your lungs.

The “thinning agents” in CBD vaping juice are most commonly: Propylene Glycol or Vegetable Glycol/Vegetable Glycerine. Thinning agents allow CBD to move through the vape pen and also make the CBD last longer.

Now, all of these compounds make your CBD oils thin enough to “wick” – and vaporize – when the electronic coils inside vape pens heat up.

While The Names All Mean The Same Thing, EVERY CBD Vaping Liquid Is Different

So there are two major takeaways from this section.

First of all, regular CBD oil cannot be vaped, and CBD vaping oil/e-liquid shouldn’t be orally ingested. Each one is made for completely different things.

Secondly, every vaping juice is unique. Choosing the right CBD vaping oil really comes down to personal preferences. That’s why in this next section, we’re going to get into HOW you can choose the right vaping e-liquid for you.

How To Choose The Right CBD E-Liquid For Your Vaping Pleasure

Our goal is to educate you because an informed consumer can pick the right products for his or herself.

Here are the things to look for.

Extraction Is The Key

Extraction is critical in determining the quality and the potency of any CBD vape oil. There are many ways to extract CBD from plants, but none of them come anywhere close to being as good as CO2 extraction.

CO2 extraction is state-of-the-art and it works in a very cool way. You see, at a certain temperature and pressure, CO2 can be both a gas and a liquid at the same time. This is called “supercritical” CO2, and it’s used as a solvent to absorb all of the active cannabinoids right out of the flower and leaves of the hemp plant.

What left over after that is just pure goodness from the plant without any leftover catalyst chemicals because the CO2 just evaporates back into the air.

Ingredients & 3rd Party Testing

The second thing you need you to look for is transparency around the ingredients in the pure CBD oil that can come from 3rd party testing.

3rd party testing is important because you want to know a company is holding itself accountable for their product to ensure what they’re saying is true. 3rd parties have their own reputation to uphold as a good testing facility. So giving a bad test result helps them maintain their positive reputation.

That means 3rd party testing is the best indication you have as a consumer to select the best CBD products. The best brands already know this they always get their oils tested by a 3rd party and they have no problem sharing the results with their customers because they’ve got nothing to hide.

Ultimately, the best solution is to find a TRANSPARENT, informative company that you TRUST – and who provides tons of information about where their CBD comes from, how it is tested, and what ingredients are in it.

(By the way, shameless plug, but here’s our process)

Personal Preference

Now, as long as you’ve answered all of the things above to your satisfaction, you can finally start to select your juices or e-liquids based on personal preferences.

You know, things like flavor!

What If Vaping Is Not For You?

You may have read all of that, and you just realized that maybe CBD vaping liquid isn’t “your thing”. That’s 100% fine, in fact, it’s great. That’s because there are tons of other ways that you can get your CBD.

One thing to bear in mind, however, is the absorption rate of the different methods of taking CBD. Inhalation, oral ingestion, and skin absorption rates vary greatly. Here’s how:

When you vape a CBD oil into your lungs, your body absorbs between 2%-56% of the CBD. The high discrepancy comes from experience: once you learn to inhale deeper and hold in the vapor for a moment or two, you can expect an average 40% absorption rate by inhalation.4

When you swallow CBD, you can expect a 4%-20% bioavailability rate, usually on the lower end below 10%. But when you sublingually take it, allowing it to absorb through the mucous membrane on the bottom of your tongue, it rises to the high end of the range between 10%-20% bioavailability.4

As far as skin absorption of CBD, it may surprise you to know it is still in its theoretical phases.4 It has been shown to slightly elevate the levels of CBD in blood but is theorized to have a more localized effect than a general one.

After absorption through your skin, the elevation in CBD levels throughout your entire bloodstream is well below the cut off point for even the most sensitive drug tests, so small it is not even a percentage.5 User reports support localized effectiveness in the local area.

So to sum up all of this, inhalation is the most effective way to absorb CBD into your body, followed by oral ingestion and finally transdermal or skin absorption. Now that you are aware of the differences, here are some of the most popular alternatives to vaping CBD.

“Regular” CBD Oil (Tinctures)

Remember way back at the beginning when we said there was one type of CBD oil you should NEVER try to vape? Well, this is it. It’s actually even more popular than vaping, believe it or not.

So how do you use a tincture? It’s just oil in a little container, and what you do is you use the dropper in the lid to squeeze a few drops under the tongue. From there, it will absorb directly into your bloodstream. Easy!

Capsules

These are even easier. Surely you’ve taken pills before? IF so, you’re already familiar with how these work. Simply swallow them, and voila! You’ve taken your CBD.

Edibles

This is where the CBD lifestyle can get fun! If you have a sweet tooth, you’ll LOVE CBD edibles because they are basically munchies infused with high-quality CBD. Gummy worms, watermelon and peach rings, lollipops, chocolate chip cookies

Isn’t it making your mouth water just thinking about it? You can see our selection of CBD edibles here

Sprays

These are really cool. First of all, sprays are the main medical form of administration the FDA-approved CBD-based medicine, Epidolex, is a spray. So there’s a lot of research on sprays.

And basically, you simply spray them into your mouth, under your tongue just like the tinctures. But the best part is, there are different formulas with different kinds of terpenes and formations of CBD to achieve different results.

Beauty

If you already use any beauty products body butter, facial cleanser, anti-aging cream, or even the basics like chapstick, lotion, and conditioner Then you’re going to love how you can get your CBD now without changing your routine at all.

All you have to do is replace some (or all) of your beauty products with other, CBD-infused alternatives. Suddenly, without any additional effort on your part, you’re living a CBD lifestyle. Easy, effortless, beauty. Check out our selection of CBD beauty products here

What’s The BEST Way To Get Started with CBD Vape?

In this “mega-guide” to CBD vaping oils, we’ve covered a lot of ground. We’ve talked about different kinds of oils, the components that you can find in these oils

And we’ve talked about how you can avoid the tricks of the trade and find a really good oil provider. Let’s recap the main points:

Cannabis Oil Has THC, CBD Isolate doesn’t give the “full spectrum effect”, & Hemp Oil is the best of both worlds no THC, and all the healthy terpenes and phytocannabinoids.

American-grown hemp has the most quality-control

CBD E-Liquid, CBD Vaping Oil, CBD Vaping Liquid, and CBD Vape Juice, and CBD Vape Cartridges are all the same thing, but every juice is different and you need to be careful selecting one

CO2 extraction for CBD is the best

Transparency and third-party testing are important (unless you don’t care about your health then do whatever you want)

Watch out for sales tactics and misleading labels

Vaping isn’t the only way to get your CBD

The Many Benefits Of Vaping

If you like the idea of vaping, rest assured: it is perhaps the most enjoyable way to consistently take advantage of the health benefits of CBD. It’s convenient, tasty, fun and an interesting way to pass the time with your friends.

When you vape CBD, you can blow big clouds or vapor rings, and have fun assembling different kinds of mods (for your CBD vape pen). If you’re trying to quit a more destructive habit like smoking then it can help you have something to do instead.

The only point of caution is finding the right CBD oils.

That’s why Pure Hemp Shop vaping oils hit every check-mark in this article. We only use the purest American-grown hemp that has never been treated with chemicals or pesticides. Our hemp is 100% organic and non-GMO, and we exclusively use CO2 extraction.

Every one of our products is 3rd party-tested (multiple times) and we even make sure our hemp oil is fresh by only making small batches.

On top of that, we hold tasting parties for all of our flavors, so we KNOW that our e-liquid flavors are the best around!

So..What Do You Need To Start Vaping Today?

If you’re ready to vape CBD oil and start enjoying that delicious vapor right away, then there are a couple of things you’ll want to get.

The first thing you need is some form of electronic CBD vape pen. We recommend a variable voltage 510 battery. You can get the official Pure Hemp shop one here.

This variable voltage 510 battery connects directly to any of the 510 CBD vape cartridges we also have for sale here in a variety of flavors.

You simply connect the battery to the cartridge and the mouthpiece is already there. Once the two are connected and it’s turn on, you will be able to vape!

Finally, if you already own some other kind of mod then we have straight CBD vaping juice for your vaping needs too, simply check it out here

Hopefully, this mega-guide was also mega-helpful, and we hope you’ve learned a thing or two about the industry and how to find high-quality vape juices and e-liquids for your CBD needs.

But most of all, we hope that we have been able to support your journey towards the kind of holistic, amazing health that only CBD can provide! Here’s to your health and your happiness. Now let’s have a cloud competition! We’ll take the Pineapple Express flavor vapor!
