WeWork has officially opened three office spaces in Nanjing.

They are located at Nanjing IFC, Golden Eagle Hexi, and the Golden Eagle Centre Tower A. The Nanjing IFC office space, spanning four floors, is situated in Jianye District in Nanjing and is at the heart of the Hexi central business district. The Golden Eagle Hexi office space is located in the same district as well.

The Golden Eagle Centre Tower A office space is situated in Xinjiekou, a vital shopping district in the city.

“We truly appreciate the unfailing support provided by the Jianye District government and Hexi CBD for enabling WeWork to make its presence in the Nanjing market,” said Alan Ai, general manager of WeWork Greater China.

“In the future, WeWork will spare no effort in attracting innovative entrepreneurs and talent to Nanjing and more members in the modern service industry by leveraging our experience in the co-working space.

“WeWork aims to help Jianye District become a digital economy centre with integrated financial and technological development, and to help Hexi CBD become a regional cluster in eastern China for the modern service industry, including financial, headquarters, exhibitions, culture and sports, and commerce and trade.”

Nanjing is the fourth city in the Yangtze River Delta Region that WeWork is operating in. The other three cities include Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Suzhou.

In July 2019, WeWork signed a strategic co-operation agreement with the Nanjing Jianye District People’s Government to set up the Nanjing regional headquarters at Nanjing Hexi central business district.
