NEW DELHI: It was a week full of action on Dalal Street . On one side, there was mixed sentiments in global markets as the US and China signed Phase I of trade deal, on the other, local markets focussed mainly on the December quarter earnings. And in Friday's session, the Supreme Court verdict telecom AGR caused a stir.For the week, the benchmark indices closed on a positive note, having scaled fresh record highs through most of the week. An even stellar performance came from the broader markets. All eyes now shift to the Union Budget and Q3 earnings from the blue chip firms in general, and banks, in particular.Here's a look at what analysts made of the week gone by, as they shared their piece of mind on microblogging site Twitter:Independent market expert Sandip Sabharwal made a case for personal income-tax cut in Union Budget and said there is no point tweaking LTCG and DDT, as they would give further impetus to an already frothy market.Value investor Safir Anand says shutting down of Vodafone Idea will be a big negative on the FDI front and it doesn't spell positive for India but only Airtel.He said the government must come out with a statement on telcos, as there is a lot at stake, including on jobs and huge bank money.Sandip Sabharwal on TCS, RIL and why their results did not impress him:-Sabharwal says IndusInd Bank recognised DHFL as a 'fraud'. If other banks follow suit, then the impact on asset quality could be significant.Sabharwal says debt mutual funds have become like PSU companies in terms of exposure to stressed accounts, but are investing like equity mutual funds.He recommended going for bank FDs and long-term government bond funds, instead of debt MFs.Sabharwal says the midcap space provides active stock pickers a great opportunity.And here’s his back-to-basic strategy for making money in stocksShyam Sekhar of iThought says the market always rewards diligent workers.
