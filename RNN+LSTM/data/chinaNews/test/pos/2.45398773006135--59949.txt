The Chinese aircraft supposed to pick up coronavirus-related humanitarian aid landed at M.R. Stefanik Bratislava Airport on Friday morning. It was expected to stay on the tarmac for 8 hours. The Transport and Construction Minister Arpad Ersek said that his resort had granted a permission to land in Slovakia to the commercial flight. The permission was given on the condition that the crew would stay aboard the aircraft throughout its stay in Slovakia. According to Ersek, the humanitarian aid will be loaded up onto the aircraft under strict security measures and overseen by Slovak health officers. Based on the Health Ministry's decision, the airport staff will approach the flight crew wearing protective clothing. The Chinese aircraft asked for permission to fly from Shanghai to Bratislava and subsequently to Beijing to pick up humanitarian aid to combat the outbreak of coronavirus. According to the Transport Ministry, the humanitarian aid is being provided by a group of Slovak businesses.
