Ahead of the Lunar New Year 2020, Nhan Dan (People) Newspaper’s resident correspondents in foreign countries recorded their comments and feelings of international friends and overseas Vietnamese on the imprints of friendship and cooperation between Vietnam and other countries.

Great friendship

On the occasion of the official visit made by Vietnamese Party General Secretary and President Nguyen Phu Trong to Laos in February 2019, the relationship between the two countries has further developed into a promising and great friendship with a special solidarity and comprehensive cooperation. Dr. Singthongsing Hapannha, Acting Director of the Lao Kaysone Phomvihane Museum, emphasised that the great friendship was an absolute necessity, reflecting the movement and development of Laos – Vietnam relations. The young generations from both sides are always proud and should uphold their responsibilities to preserv and promote the traditional relations.

In 2019, Vietnam’s major projects in Laos saw positive progress, including the implementation of the bauxite mining and processing project by Viet Phuong Investment Group Joint Stock Company and the formation of a farm for a cow breeding project from the Vietnam Dairy Products Joint Stock Company (Vinamilk).

The serene spring atmosphere is spread throughout the brother countries of Vietnam and Laos, along with strong hopes and signals for a deeper connection between the two economies.

Maintaining steady development momentum

At a ceremony held in China to mark the 74th anniversary of Vietnam’s National Day, Vietnamese Ambassador Dang Minh Khoi affirmed that the economic, trade and investment cooperation between the two countries continued to record at a steady pace last year. In addition, the two sides witnessed a vibrant movement between the cultural and tourism cooperation and people-to-people exchange. Vietnam has been China’s largest trading partner in ASEAN and the eighth largest trading partner in the world for the last three consecutive years. The two sides maintained regular exchanges from high-level visits and contacts as well as agreed to make joint efforts to maintain peace and stability, and control and find appropriate settlements regarding disputes at sea.

Talking with Nhan Dan Newspaper’s reporter after the art programme entitled “The bridge of friendship”, Professor Fan Jin E from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said that the love for the land and people of Vietnam is huge. In her mind, she always considers Vietnam as her second homeland.

The year 2020 marks the 70th founding anniversary of Vietnam - China diplomatic ties. It is believed and hoped that the relations between the two countries will continue to develop steadily.

The borderline of peace and cooperation

The highlight of Vietnam - Cambodia cooperation in 2019 was the signing of two legal documents that recognised the completion of 84% of the workload for border demarcation and landmark planting between the two sides. The efforts towards the full completion of the border demarcation have contributed to enhancing the mutual understandings while boosting the economic, trade and investment cooperation between the two nations.

Thanks to the construction and maintenance of the border of peace, stability and friendship, the economic and trade relations between Vietnam and Cambodia have increasingly strengthened over the past years. The trade turnover between the two sides reached over US$4.7 billion in 2018, a year-on-year increase of 23.8%. Their trade turnover was estimated at US$5.2 billion, exceeding the plan and fulfilling the goal one year earlier than the deadline set by the Prime Ministers of the two countries.

Significant contributions to ASEAN

Vietnam left a strong and good impression during a series of regional conferences and events in 2019 when Thailand took over the chairmanship of ASEAN. PM Nguyen Xuan Phuc’s official visit and attendance of the ASEAN Summit and National Assembly Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan’s official visit and attendance of the 40th General Assembly of AIPA (AIPA 40) are the notable events.

Vietnam emphasised that ASEAN should continue to prioritise the enhancement of solidarity and intra-regional cohesion as well as the promotion of the central and effective role of regional security and cooperation mechanisms which were chaired and led by ASEAN. The bloc should also continue to strengthen intra-regional economic links and sign the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) soon. Regarding the issues in the East Sea, Vietnam reaffirmed the common principles and perceptions that were widely recognised by ASEAN countries and the international community. Accordingly, the country valued highly the compliance with international law and the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS); refraining from taking any action that can further complicate the situation; fully and seriously implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (East Sea) (DOC); and endeavor to complete an effective and efficient Code of Conduct in the East Sea (COC) in accordance with international law.

On June 18, 1919, the patriotic young person Nguyen Ai Quoc, who represented “the Group of Annamese Patriots”, sent an eight page article claim to the Versailles Peace Conference, demanding freedom, democracy and equal rights for Vietnam. The event laid the foundation for the birth of the patriotic movement of Overseas Vietnamese in France - the forerunner of the Vietnamese Association in France today. A ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the patriotic movement of the Overseas Vietnamese in France was held on June 15, 2019, at the House of Mutual Assistance in District 5, French capital city of Paris, where President Ho Chi Minh met and talked with around 2,000 Vietnamese expatriates on the occasion of his visit to France in 1946.

On behalf of Party and State leaders, NA Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan presented the first-class Labour Order for the second time to the Overseas Vietnamese Association in France during her official visit to the country. The noble award honours the important and positive contributions made by the Overseas Vietnamese community in France.
