Wolftank-Adisa: Wolftank-Adisa Holding AG announced its Xetra listing on Deutsche Börse. Additionally to the existing stock markets Vienna and Munich, Wolftank-Adisa Holding shares are now also listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. "After a pleasing operative year, we would now like to focus more strongly on our capital market presence and investor relations, says Peter Werth, CEO of Wolftank-Adisa- Holding AG. "In this context, we are particularly interested to draw the attention to ecological sustainability given the background of our environmental protection and tank rehabilitation activities, leading above all in more active trading of our shares. We are convinced that our efforts and measures will increasingly get higher attention by the public and ecologically-minded investors", Werth continues.

AT&S: Plant II at the Chinese AT&S location in Chongqing will resume operations. AT&S, global market leader for high-end printed circuit boards and one of the leading manufacturers of IC substrates, is one of the first companies in the Yufu industrial park in Chongqing to receive this approval for restarting. Due to the coronavirus, the Chinese New Year holidays were extended. The opening of the plant was preceded by very intensive negotiations with the Chinese authorities, which, in accordance with a local regulation, tie the restart of production to strict requirements. With the approval, all three Chinese AT&S plants are now in operation again, at least with limited capacities. Chongqing Plant I continued operation during the New Year holidays with a short, maintenance-related interruption and therefore did not fall under the above-mentioned regulation to restart production. The largest Chinese AT&S plant in Shanghai went into operation as planned on February 10, after the extended New Year holidays. However, the situation in China remains volatile and is being closely monitored and supervised by the top management.

AT&S: weekly performance: 7.28%
