Shanghai (Gasgoo)- Although hills'n rills set us apart, the moon and wind share our kind heart.



The poem written on the relief supply boxes sent from Japan as a sign of heartfelt support for China really touches people who are experiencing a fierce combat with the novel coronavirus. Amid the nationwide epidemic spread, numerous helping hands are reached out from every corner of the society to help the country win the battle.

Among companies that give the generous donation, a number of auto parts suppliers are on the frontline. They not only include China’s local enterprises like CATL and Fuyao Group, but contain multiple global suppliers that have operations in China, such as Bosch, Michelin, Valeo, Shell and Continental.

The donations have been proffered in manifold forms. Most of them gave cash to charities, while some donated the urgently needed medical supplies, such as face mask, goggles and protective suits, by sourcing them worldwide. No matter how much money they have given, these companies are showing their strong sense of social responsibility.

For instance, Chinese battery giant CATL announced on Jan. 27 it would donate RMB10 million to the Red Cross Society of China Hubei Branch. The money will be used to cure patients, and prevent and control the coronavirus spread in infected regions.

Fuyao Group, a glass manufacturer known by the world for the Obama-back documentary “American Factory” , procured €1.29 million worth of medical supplies from Germany and France, and have sent them to Fuzhou, Fujian Province. There are 120,000 FFP2 masks, 960,000 surgical masks, 200,000 pairs of disposable gloves, 100,000 sets of protective clothing as well as numerous face shields, goggles, shoes covers and rubber gloves, aggregating 2.41 million units.

Its Japanese branch on Feb. 8 dispatched RMB600,000 worth of supplies from Tokyo to Fuzhou. The 10,000-unit supplies include medical masks, protective suits and protective gloves, etc.

Besides, Cao Dewang, chairman of Fuyao Group, proposed on Jan. 30 that Heren Charitable Foundation donates RMB100 million—RMB 70 million for Hubei and RMB30 million for Fujian province—to fight against the coronavirus epidemic. The foundation started by Mr. Cao in 2011.

Moreover, such Japanese suppliers as Denso, Aisin, Toyota Boshoku, Hitachi and JTEKT, and the Europe-based companies like Bosch, Valeo, Faurecia and Continental all join the splendid donation wave. Since the number is too big, please forgive me for not having all companies introduced here. Gasgoo made a list about the donation records of some auto suppliers. This is incomplete, but we will update it in time once we catch new information.
