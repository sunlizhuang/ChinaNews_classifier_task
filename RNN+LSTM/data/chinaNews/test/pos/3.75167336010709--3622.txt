Chinese manufacturing giant, Xiaomi, has been quite successful in the smart band market. Right from its first Mi Band, the companyâ€™s smart band has been impressive. However, the company really broke the market with the Mi Band 3 and Mi Band 4. The Xiaomi Mi Band 4 sold over 1 million units in eight days. This shows its popularity and netizens are already anticipating the Xiaomi Mi Band 5. From the Mi Band 3, Xiaomi introduced the NFC version. Interestingly, the Mi Band 4 NFC version sold like wildfire. Thus there are reports that Xiaomi will move a step further with its NFC operability and the display size.

According to recent information from TizenHelp, the upcoming Xiaomi Mi Band 5 will come with a 1.2-inch display. This is larger than the 0.95-inch AMOLED screen on its predecessor. This means that the band 5 details will be more visible and there will be more space for icons. Despite the larger display, this device will be lighter and with more contrast. Thus, reading from the band in sunlight will be easier.

As of now, Xiaomi NFC Bands are only active in China. Nevertheless, the latest report reaffirms previous speculations that the Xiaomi Mi Band 5 NFC version will be active in the global market. From the report, it will support Google Pay & other payment services. The Mi Band 5 NFC global version will support contactless payments, work pass and can be used as a bus card. These features are currently active in China. Xiaomi releases its Mi Band every year so we expect the Band 5 next year. From previous hints, the Mi Band 5 may arrive in Q2 2020. The report claims that this band will launch in China for 179 yuan ($26).

As usual, Xiaomi will collaborate with Huami on its next band. Nevertheless, there is no official details on this device for now. However, the speculations so far are good and NFC for global users should be a hit. What do you think?
