The annual China Conference & Business Travel Fair (CCBTF) organised by the Shanghai Municipal Administration of Culture and Tourism, has received official endorsement from the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA).

The endorsement bolster’s Shanghai’s efforts to position itself as a leading hub for conferences.

This ICCA endorsement came during a meeting between Patrick Chen (Director of Marketing and Promotion Department, Shanghai Municipal Administration of Culture and Tourism) and Senthil Gopinath (ICCA CEO) and Noor Ahmad Hamid (ICCA Regional Director for Asia Pacific) last month in Shanghai.

The first CCBTF was held in 2011 and the two-day event now focusses on industry engagement.

Shanghai hosted the 52nd ICCA Congress in 2013, which was the first time an annual ICCA Congress was held in China.

ICCA CEO, Senthil Gopinath said: “It is my fervent hope that this endorsement will enable Shanghai to focus more concertedly on the international association meetings business segment.”

Patrick Chen added: “CCBTF serves as a powerful platform where leaders of our industry co-create content and co-explore business and growth opportunities. Shanghai has a long relationship with ICCA since 2001 and we are pleased that the endorsement will take the ICCA-Shanghai partnership to the next level.”

The CCBTF 2020 will be held 23-24 September 2020 at Shanghai International Convention Centre.
