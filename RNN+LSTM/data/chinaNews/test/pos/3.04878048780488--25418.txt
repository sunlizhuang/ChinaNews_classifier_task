A Geekbench record for a Xiaomi Redmi 8A has been spotted that states the device in question was operating with Android 10. At the moment, the budget smartphone operates on an Android 9 Pie-based version of Xiaomi’s MIUI 11.

The entry on Geekbench was only uploaded on January 24, which could be seen as a sign that the Chinese manufacturer is preparing to release Android 10 for the Xiaomi Redmi 8A sooner rather than later. It has been previously reported that the smartphone, which features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 combined with a Qualcomm Adreno 505, would possibly get Android 10 in the second or third quarter of 2020, even as late as November.

It will be a welcome upgrade for those who enjoy the many features of the Xiaomi Redmi 8A, which offers a 5,000 mAh battery, a 6.22-inch display, and an up-to-date aesthetic all for a reasonable price. Xiaomi has been criticized for its handling of the roll-out of Android 10 to its devices, with many users presuming MIUI 11 was only based on the most recent Android mobile OS.
