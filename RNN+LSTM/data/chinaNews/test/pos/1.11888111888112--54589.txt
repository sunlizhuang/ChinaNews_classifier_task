President Donald Trump, looking ahead to his reelection campaign, spent far more of his State of the Union address Tuesday reciting his administration’s accomplishments than offering significant new policy proposals.

Given the low likelihood that Congress would pass any substantive legislate initiatives, that’s not entirely unexpected. But no mention was made of second phases of two of Trump’s significant economic policy accomplishments, such as a new round of tax cuts hinted at by some advisors, or a phase-two trade pact with China to follow onto the recently enacted phase-one.

“It seemed to be a preamble to the campaign,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist for Prudential Financial. More than laying out specific policy proposals, she saw the address as an attempt by Trump to broaden his appeal beyond his base.

Much of the president’s address was devoted to listing, and taking credit for, the record-long U.S. economic expansion that began in 2009. In particular, he pointed to the record stock market, claiming the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners grew by 47%, three times faster than for the top 1%. Yet in dollar terms, the lion’s share of equity gains still go to the wealthiest 10%, who own 84% of stocks.

Among economic matters, the president emphasized containment of health-care costs and preserving insurance coverage of preexisting conditions. Those are themes both parties are behind.

“My administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies. We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs, and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before. I was pleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down,” Trump said.

“And working together, the Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels. I have been speaking to Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in the Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done quickly and properly. I am calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. Get a bill to my desk, and I will sign it into law immediately,” he added, without specifics.

That was significantly less severe than some of the more draconian proposals that Barron’s reporter Josh Nathan-Kazis said the president could outline in the State of the Union.

The Wall Street Journal noted Congressional Democrats responded to Trump’s push for the Grassley bill by chanting loudly, “HR3,” a reference to House-passed legislation to lower prescription drug prices that has been blocked in the Senate by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, preferring to move ahead on the bill backed by Grassley along with Sen. Ron Wyden.

But Trump was clear in blasting the so-called Medicare for All plan backed by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the two progressive candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination.

As for other economic initiatives, the president called for infrastructure spending, which elicited loud applause on both sides of the aisle. But his proposal was to call for Congressional passage of a highway bill sponsored by Sen. John Barrasso. That’s a far cry from the ambitious, $1 trillion plan to rebuild roads, bridges and other projects that Trump proposed in 2018 and was a major part of both parties’ campaigns in 2016.

In addition, Trump called for expansion for high-speed internet access for all citizens, including rural America, without giving specifics of how to accomplish that.

Even without details about specific new programs, Prudential’s Krosby suggested the State of the Union should help Trump’s approval ratings further. Gallup reported on Tuesday the president’s job approval rating hit 49%, the highest of his term. The polling organization also found 63% of Americans approve of his handling of the economy, the highest of any president since George W. Bush’s “stratospheric job approval ratings” following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Given those high approval ratings, it’s perhaps not surprising that Trump would use most of the State of the Union to look back on his record rather than to preview future plans that can be unveiled on the campaign trail.
