Taco chain Tacombi is adding three new locations

Popular taco chain Tacombi’s NYC expansion is continuing unabated. The taco destination will open its tenth and eleventh location this year on the Upper East Side and Long Island City, respectively, the Commercial Observer has learned. The UES location will be at 202 East 70th Street, between Second and Third Avenues; and the LIC spot is at 27-10 43rd Avenue, between Hunter Street and Jackson Avenue. The latter is also Tacombi’s first Queens location. Eater has reached out for more information on timing of the openings. A FiDi location is set to open soon as well.

Known for slinging out tacos with barbacoa, crispy fish, and carnitas, and cold-pressed juices, Tacombi started out of a Volkswagen trailer in Mexico back in 2005. Following a couple of locations in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico, Tacombi arrived in Nolita in 2010. The decade since has seen a steady expansion for the mini-chain, with outposts in Williamsburg, the Upper West Side, and Montauk.
