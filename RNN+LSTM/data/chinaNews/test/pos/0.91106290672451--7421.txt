Shape Created with Sketch. The best films of 2019 Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. The best films of 2019 1/20 20. Minding the Gap One of the year’s biggest cinematic curveballs occurs at the midway point of this stirring documentary. Billed as a film about small-town US skate culture, Bing Liu’s Minding the Gap grows into a haunting depiction of class and masculinity, and how once inseparable groups of friends tend to untangle and diverge as they come of age. Few of 2019’s films cast quite as long a shadow. Adam White Hulu 2/20 19. The Farewell The Farewell rips your heart out of your chest. Then it hands it back to you, wrapped gently in cotton wool. Director Lulu Wang loosely adapts a chapter in her own life, as we follow a young woman (Awkwafina) travelling back to China to say goodbye to her terminally ill grandmother. Delving into all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, it’s a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Clarisse Loughrey A24 3/20 18. Us An opportunity for Jordan Peele to cement his status as one of horror’s modern maestros, Us reels us in with old-fashioned thrills. Then it leaves us with the terrible dread of realising we’ve been looking into a mirror this whole time. Lupita Nyong'o delivers two of this year’s best performances in one film, both as our hero and as her sinister doppelgänger – one of an army of “Tethereds” that emerge from underground seeking vengeance. Clarisse Loughrey Universal Pictures 4/20 17. Pain & Glory All of Pedro Almodovar’s films feel autobiographical in one way or another, but Pain & Glory couldn’t be more lived-in if he stepped out in front of the camera to introduce every scene. A lushly romantic ode to cinema, shared history and cruelly interrupted love, it features a career-best performance from Antonio Banderas – Zorro at his most tender and vulnerable. Adam White Sony Pictures 5/20 16. Vox Lux Vox Lux is 2019’s most damning filmic portrait of American culture. We begin with a teenage girl (Raffey Cassidy), who survives a school shooting and ends up a pop star. As an adult, she’s played by a breezy, vicious Natalie Portman. Her strut is one part Sia, two parts Lady Gaga. It’s an ugly, despairing film that comes gift-wrapped in sequins, presenting art as the cavernous pit we throw our traumas into. Clarisse Loughrey Neon 6/20 15. Under the Silver Lake A paranoid puzzle box of a mystery, Under the Silver Lake is far more interested in the directions down the rabbit hole than allowing star Andrew Garfield to crawl his way out of it. That’s also the most pleasurable aspect of David Robert Mitchell’s film, a sunny LA noir which is sinister, hilarious and (potentially ruinously) male. It’s probably 2019’s most polarising film, adored and reviled in equal measure, but undeniably a work of striking creative autonomy. Adam White Mubi 7/20 14. High Life High Life has its silly sub-Barbarella moments (Juliette Binoche testing out the spaceship’s very own orgasmatron machine) and clearly wasn’t made on a Hollywood budget. Nonetheless, veteran French auteur Claire Denis’s first English language film is a typically provocative and subversive affair. Binoche plays Dr Dibs, a scientist on board a ship full of criminals and trying to harvest healthy foetuses. Geoffrey Macnab A24 8/20 13. Ad Astra Ad Astra is a space movie with an Oedipal undertow. Brad Pitt gives a fine, understated performance as the introspective astronaut trying to save the world and find his father at the same time. Writer-director James Gray throws in references to Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now. This is a slow-moving but beguiling film with an unexpected emotional kick. Geoffrey Macnab Fox 9/20 12. Happy as Lazzaro A bee keeper’s daughter, Italian director Alice Rohrwacher is one of European cinema’s visionary young talents. Happy As Lazzaro, her best film yet, is a magical realist fable that combines hard-hitting social comment about the exploitation of rural workers with flights of astonishing lyricism. The film also has one of the best performances of the year from newcomer Adriano Tardiolo, an 18-year-old economics student who plays the holy innocent, Lazzaro, with an ingenuousness which rekindles memories of Peter Sellers in Being There. Geoffrey Macnab Simona Pampallona/Netflix 10/20 11. Burning Based on a Haruki Murakami’s short story, Burning – from South Korean maestro Lee Chang-dong – is a meditation on dealing with isolation and the tricks being alone might play on your memory. Jong-su (Ah-in Yoo) is forced to play detective when Steven Yeun’s affluent bachelor rolls into town – an event that coincides with the disappearance of a schoolfriend. Burning is a searing drama whose central unanswered mystery unnerves long after the credits role. Jacob Stolworthy Thunderbird Releasing 11/20 10. For Sama News coverage has hardly been short of harrowing, violent footage of the Syrian Civil War. But too often missing are the human moments inbetween the bombings and the bloodshed. In Waad Al-Kateab’s first person account of the uprising’s aftermath, her camera’s gaze never flinches from the horrors it sees – as she and her husband try to maintain a rebel hospital amid a reign of bombing from President al-Assad – but nor does it stop rolling while she falls in love, has a baby, and jokes around with her friends and neighbours. This is the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It is an important, powerful, astonishing documentary. Alex Pollard Republic Film Distribution 12/20 9. Can You Ever Forgive Me? It feels almost blasphemous to be glad of Julianne Moore stepping down from a role, but Lee Israel – the cantankerous, lonely literary forger who found herself the target of an FBI investigation in the Nineties – feels like a part Melissa McCarthy was born to play. Nimbly directed by Marielle Heller (who was shunned by the Oscars in the Best Director category), Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a sharp, funny and deeply compassionate examination of loneliness and self-destruction. Richard E Grant and Dolly Wells give wonderful supporting performances, too. Alex Pollard AP 13/20 8. Booksmart As deeply indebted to the teen movie genre as it is formally and narratively rebellious, Booksmart grounds its traditional night-before-graduation plot (teenagers eager to crash a party) in touching character-driven drama. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, both instant stars, convey the ever-shifting dynamics and heightened dramas of adolescent best-friendship perfectly. Behind the camera, meanwhile, actor-turned-director Olivia Wilde demonstrates a staggering amount of emotional empathy and technical mastery for someone so green. Adam White Annapurna Pictures 14/20 7. The Irishman Comparisons to Martin Scorsese’s previous films (Goodfellas, Casino) are unfounded considering The Irishman is unlike any other gangster film you’ll see. With his three-hour-30-minute-long opus, Scorsese places the harsh spotlight on mortality. Instead of tracking the rise of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) from regular family man to seasoned hitman with glitzy panache, we see him shamefully confess his crimes as an elderly man ruminating on his past in a nursing home. The result is an unsettlingly moving character study unafraid to ask the big questions.​Jacob Stolworthy Netflix 15/20 6. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood With his ninth feature, Quentin Tarantino took a breath and crafted an unhurried, oddly heartwarming fable, one that came with a career-best performance from Brad Pitt. Its release rolled around with the usual smattering of discourse-steering controversy but, for all the complaints about the director’s depiction of his film star subjects, including the scant usage of Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, the fact remains that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is one of the filmmaker’s most accomplished films – a free’n’easy sun-soaked delve into Sixties Hollywood, whose much-discussed final 20 minutes provided topics of conversation all summer long. Jacob Stolworthy Andrew Cooper/Sony-Columbia Pictures via AP 16/20 5. Eighth Grade For too many years the internet was exclusively evil in movies, something for tech boffins to hack, or used to steal Sandra Bullock’s identity. Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade felt so comparatively real because it felt like the real internet, which has been as toxic and terrifying as it has been helpful to a generation of young people. Elsie Fisher, as a 13-year-old girl chronicling her confidence and anxieties in a vlog, is an adorable delight here, in a film that is devastatingly, heartbreakingly and endearingly human. Adam White Rex 17/20 4. The Favourite Yorgos Lanthimos’s delightful, subversive vision has shaken the cobwebs out of costume drama. Set in the 18th century, it follows a trio of women – two cousins, Sarah (Rachel Weisz) and Abigail (Emma Stone), and the ruling Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) – as they vie for power over each other and England. Desire, savagery, and manipulative vulnerability all become weapons in the hands of those who have no choice but to fight dirty. But, then, Colman’s childless, gout-ridden Queen Anne tenderly reveals her shattered soul – it’s an Academy Award-winning performance that brings a slice of tragedy to an otherwise sublime farce. Clarisse Loughrey AP 18/20 3. If Beale Street Could Talk The marriage of disparate talents united to ensure If Beale Street Could Talk is worthy of mention alongside Barry Jenkins’ previous film, Moonlight – The Independent’s film of the decade. With his film, Jenkins takes the words of James Baldwin and translates them into visual poetry. From Nicholas Britell’s mesmerising score to Regina King’s towering supporting performance (that Oscar was well deserved), the result is a creative tour de force. Jacob Stolworthy Photos Annapurna Pictures 19/20 2. Marriage Story Here is a love story about divorce. Noah Baumbach writes and directs this aching, empathetic depiction of a couple whose marriage has fallen apart. As ruthless divorce lawyers driving a wedge between two people already hanging by a thread, Ray Liotta and Laura Dern are magnificent, while Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance in years as a woman trying to do the right thing without knowing what that is. But the real star is Adam Driver, who – hulking as he is – makes himself seem small and fragile. For his rendition of Sondheim’s “Being Alive” alone, Marriage Story deserves all the awards coming its way. Alex Pollard Netflix 20/20 1. Little Women Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 novel – the story of four Massachusetts sisters coming of age during the American Civil War – may be a period piece, but there is nothing staid or stuffy about it. The girls, played by Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen, talk and clamber over one another, their hair messy, their dresses scorched, their ambitions unfettered. It is a lively, profound adaptation. Alexandre Desplat provides the exuberant score, and Yorick La Saux’s cinematography is lush and textured. “I didn’t want it to be beautiful at the expense of being real,” said Gerwig. “But I did want it to feel like you wish you can jump inside and live in there or eat it. I remember trying to explain that to the gaffer, who was like, ‘You want what?’ I was like, ‘I want them to want to eat it.’” And how delicious it is.

Netflix is having a great year

The streaming platform missed out on Best Picture last year, despite a rather successful awards campaign for Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma. It’s certainly not giving up this year, with Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman and Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story landing in several key categories. Both films are now in competition for Best Picture and the cast of Marriage Story has scored nominations in the Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress categories, while The Irishman is up for Best Director as well as Best Supporting Actor (times two, with Joe Pesci and Al Pacino competing against each other). (CM)

Tom Hanks scores his first Oscar nomination in nearly 20 years

It might be hard to believe, given that he’s barely ever put a foot wrong, but this is Tom Hanks’s first Oscar nomination in almost two decades. Despite stellar work in the likes of Catch Me If You Can (2002), The Terminal (2004), Captain Phillips (2013), Saving Mr Banks (2013) and The Post (2017), the 63-year-old international treasure hasn’t been recognised by the academy since 2001’s Cast Away. (AP)

Parasite makes history

Parasite, Bong Joon-ho’s razor-sharp social satire, is the first South Korean film ever to be nominated for Best Picture. It’s swept the board elsewhere, too, with Bong getting a Best Director nod (the only non-white person in an all-male category). It would have been nice to see some of the actors getting recognised – particularly Song Kang-ho, who gave one of the best performances of his already-illustrious career as the wiley patriarch – but it seems that was a dream too big. (AP)

Greta Gerwig gets overlooked for Best Director

Gerwig’s acclaimed adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s classic novel is up for Best Picture, but Gerwig herself was entirely deserving of a nomination in the Best Director category. Besides, including her would have been a wonderful way to infuse some diversity into the overwhelmingly male list of nominees. Which brings us to… (CM)

Where are the female filmmakers?

At the risk of sounding like a broken record, once again, a major awards ceremony has only put forward male filmmakers in the race for Best Director. This is unforgivable at any given time, but it seems especially unfair given that female filmmakers put out some of the best releases of the past 12 months – just look at Greta Gerwig’s Little Women, Lorene Scafaria’s Hustlers, Alma Har'el’s Honey Boy, Marielle Heller's A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood and Lulu Wang's The Farewell. (CM)

Jennifer Lopez deserved a shot at Best Actress

In order to prepare for her role in Hustlers, Lopez learnt an entire new skill (pole dancing, which, in case you’re wondering, is far from easy) – and that’s just the cherry on top of her very strong acting performance as veteran stripper Ramona Vega. She certainly deserved a prime spot on the list of Best Actress nominees, but alas, the Academy decided otherwise. (CM)

Will Brad Pitt finally get an Oscar?

The actor has been a favourite as Best Supporting Actor this awards season, and now he’s officially got a shot at an Oscar in that category. His performance as Cliff Booth in Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood could earn the 56-year-old the first Academy Award of his career, after being nominated for Best Actor in Moneyball (2012) and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2009), and for Best Supporting Actor in 12 Monkeys (1996). (CM)

There's still some hope for Little Women

While Gerwig was snubbed for Best Director, her film is officially up for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Costume Design and Best Original Score. Saoirse Ronan is up for Best Actress for her turn as Jo March, while Florence Pugh is in the running for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Amy. (CM)

Taron Egerton misses out on a slot for Best Actor

The English actor took home a Golden Globe in the Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his performance as Elton John, but didn’t secure a similar nomination on the Oscars side. In fact, Rocketman is nominated in just one category: Best Original Song for “I’m Gonna Love Me Again”. (CM)

Antonio Banderas scores his first Oscar nomination

The 59-year-old actor is in the running for Best Actor for his celebrated performance in Pain and Glory. This is the first Academy Award nomination of his career, and it puts him in competition with Leonardo DiCaprio, Adam Driver, Jonathan Pryce and Joaquin Phoenix. (CM)

No love for Uncut Gems

Adam Sandler was considered a strong contender for a Best Actor nomination after his acclaimed performance in Uncut Gems, but the Academy has expressed different views by keeping him out of the category. Fans are furious. (CM)

What happened to The Farewell?

Lulu Wang’s film has distinguished itself on several occasions this awards season – including when Awkwafina won Best Actress – Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globes. Nevertheless, The Farewell as well as its stars (Zhao Shuzhen and Awkwafina had both generated some Oscar chatter) weren’t recognised by the Academy. (CM)

The 2020 Oscars will take place on 9 February. You can see a full list of nominations here.
