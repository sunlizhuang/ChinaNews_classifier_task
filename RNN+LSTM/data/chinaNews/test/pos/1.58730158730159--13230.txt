TROOPS worked on the key skill of moving supplies across the battlefield underneath the roar of a Chinook helicopter.

Soldiers from 13 Air Assault Support Regiment Royal Logistic Corps rigged and hooked up vehicles and equipment to be moved as underslung loads by an RAF helicopter. Troops on the ground and aircrew worked together to polish their skills, moving loads between Merville Barracks and Friday Woods Colchester.

Moving vehicles and supplies as underslung loads uses the pace and range of helicopters to out manoeuvre the enemy and allows units to be supported at a greater distance from their base.

13 AASR’s core role is to provide logistic and equipment support to 16 Air Assault Brigade, the Army’s airborne rapid reaction force.
