KUALA LUMPUR: A Malaysian, who was among those who arrived by flight today after being evacuated from the epicentre of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in China, said she was relieved to be home.

The woman, who only wanted to be known as Reen, 27, was staying in Hubei province. She is among 133 individuals who arrived at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) earlier today.

The flight from China included 107 Malaysians, 12 flight crew and eight Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) personnel as well as six Malaysian embassy officers from Beijing.

Reen said the Malaysian government and the parties involved were very committed in ensuring the relief mission went well.

"I express my appreciation to the government for smoothly managing the return of Malaysians. I am so grateful, finally all of us are finally brought home safely,” she said, quoted by Harian Metro.

Recounting her experience, she said Malaysians were informed by the Malaysian Embassy in China to gather at the Tianhe International Airport in Wuhan to ease their documentation and immigration processes.

She said about 5pm (local time) yesterday, she was informed that the Chinese government approved travel permits for Malaysians who needed to go to the airport. This was done due to the suspension of transportation services in the region.

“Once we had the approval, I was brought to the airport in a car owned by one of my husband’s relatives from Xiangyang to complete the documentation process.

"Most Malaysians who live outside Wuhan took nine hours just to get to the airport,” she said.

Reen added that once they arrived at KLIA this morning, all passengers and crew had to undergo health screening tests to ensure no one had the coronavirus symptoms.

She said those who had just arrived are being quarantined at a location in Nilai for 14 days before they are allowed to go home, provided they are found negative from the virus.
