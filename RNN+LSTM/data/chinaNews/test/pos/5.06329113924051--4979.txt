Will Smith took a walk down memory lane as he rapped about his impressive career and life with Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show.”



From his humble beginnings as a rapper from Philadelphia and his start as the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air to his extensive movie career and personal life, Smith, and Fallon covered it all, complete with a Carlton dance and “Gettin’ Jiggy Wit It” moves.

“It was weird doing it with you,” Smith joked when talking about rapping his autobiography with Fallon. “As we were going through, I was kinda like, ‘Wow, that was kinda [great]. I had a nice little run,'” said Smith.

Will Smith will star in the third installment of the Bad Boys series, opening in theaters on January 17th.
