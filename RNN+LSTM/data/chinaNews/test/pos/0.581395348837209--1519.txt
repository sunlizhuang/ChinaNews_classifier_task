DAB chairwoman Starry Lee says the party appealed to the Liaison Office to act as a bridge to promote communication between local and national health authorities about the progress of the illness.

The biggest pro-Beijing party in Hong Kong, the DAB, said today that it has asked Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong to press the central government to issue daily updates about an unidentified illness that is affecting Wuhan.

Speaking after visiting the liasion office and meeting the deputy director, He Jing, DAB chairwoman Starry Lee wai-king, said the party has appealed to the office to act as a bridge to promote communication between local and national health authorities about the progress of the illness.

Lee said the liaison office deputy promised to accurately reflect their concerns about the Wuhan illness to the central government immediately, after a meeting that lasted about half an hour.

The DAB chief said they did not get a chance to talk to the new liaison office chief, Luo Huining. But Lee expressed confidence in Luo's ability to lead the liaison office and implement the One Country Two Systems principle, the Basic Law and the constitution.
