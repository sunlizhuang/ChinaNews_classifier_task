In mid-January, Chinese President Xi Jinping made a historic visit to Myanmar. He vowed to build and help finance a new infrastructure project to connect the two countries in unprecedented trade-promoting ways in a so-called China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, which if realized, would be a massive milestone in part of the wider Belt & Road Initiative (BRI). The project, unfortunately, has been put on the back burner as China focuses on trying to contain the coronavirus outbreak and protect the health and safety of its citizens.
