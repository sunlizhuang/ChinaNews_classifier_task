During the Italian event, PromPeru will launch the " Show your flags at Pitti ," a new collection that reflects the concept of this edition and transmits the essence of each yarn aimed at becoming a product that will surprise the international market.





Likewise, the collection was designed by Giovanni Cavagna —an expert from haute couture (high fashion) to tricot (knitting) and Pret-a-Porter (ready-to-wear)— with professional experience at Max Mara, Les Copains, Loro Piana, and Edicion fashion businesses.









The fashion event will be presented under the "Alpaca del Peru" sectorial brand, created to position our fine fiber, which is synonymous with luxury and exclusivity.





This proposal to be put on display at the fair represents the alpaca textiles' various nuances and their strong tradition.





Also, some of the clothing items to be showcased will be camelid-fiber sweaters, as well as voluminous cotton skirts and pants.









It should be noted half of the more than 5,000 visitors to Pitti Filati come from Russia, Turkey, Japan, South Korea, and China.





They will visit the Peruvian stand, whose members will inform the specialized public about the uses and advantages of alpaca fiber. The origin and advantages of the fiber will also be addressed, as will its production in Peru.
