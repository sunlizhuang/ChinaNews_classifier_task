Read on for article

Magen David Adom has responded to the request of the Chabad organization in China sending 2000 masks and 200 full protection kits including special suits, masks, glasses, shoes and hats covers.

They are to be distributed to the fourteen Chabad-based branches across China to tackle the spread of the country’s Coronavirus.

The shipment has arrived in Hong-Kong with a Chabad Shaliach who will distribute the equipment.

Rabbi Eliyahu Rosenberg is a Chabad rabbi in Guangzhou, China. He said: “I thank the MDA Director General and his representatives for their prompt help and response. From the moment the call was made to MDA, the treatment and responsiveness were extremely fast. We are preparing to distribute the equipment to 14 Chabad houses across China to be distributed to all Israelis and Jews currently in China, and of course for the Chinese people who are so helpful and supportive of us.”
