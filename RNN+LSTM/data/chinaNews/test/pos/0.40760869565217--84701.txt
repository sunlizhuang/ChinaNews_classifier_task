The Vatican has announced that Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, Holy See's equivalent of foreign minister, recently met his Chinese counterpoint, Wang Yi, on the margins of the Munich Security Conference in Germany.

This is the highest level official meeting between representatives of the Vatican and Beijing since the Holy See and the People's Republic of China ended diplomatic relations in 1951.

"Today is the first meeting between Chinese and Vatican foreign ministers. This will open more space for future exchanges between our two sides," said Wang Yi, according to the People's Daily.

"Continuing the dialogue to promote the life of the Catholic Church"



According to Vatican-issued statement, the Feb. 14 meeting took place "in a cordial atmosphere".

It allowed the two men to discuss the "positive development" of relations between China and the Vatican, especially since the agreement of September 2018 on the appointment of Catholic bishops in China.

Archbishop Gallagher (officially the Holy See's Secretary for Relations with States) and Wang Yi also expressed their willingness "to continue the institutional dialogue at the bilateral level to promote the life of the Catholic Church and the good of the Chinese people".

For several weeks now, a number of groups defending religious freedom have been denouncing a supposed tightening of religious legislation in China, notably on the basis of a new regulation which came into force on Feb. 1.

Article 5 calls on religious organizations to "follow the leadership of the Communist Party of China" and to "continue the Sinicization of religions ... and practice fundamental socialist values".

Improvement of religious regulations

But as China expert Francesco Cisci points out, this new legislation actually signals a certain relaxation of Beijing's religious policy.

"Previously, the law stated that 'religious groups must obey the party'," he told .

"Today, the legislation explains that 'religious groups are a bridge and a link that unites and connects the Chinese Communist Party and the government with religious communities and citizens'," explained Cisci, an Italian researcher at Beijing's Renmin University and a specialist on Catholicism in China.

"This implies a dialogue between the party and religious groups," he said.

"The situation is not ideal or perfect, but it is an improvement over the past," he added.

Cisci, who conduct the first interview with the pope in the Chinese press, said it also shows that China is "willing to improve mutual trust with the Vatican".

China has always feared the use of religion by foreign powers and has long been suspicious of the pope's authority over Chinese Catholics.

Historically, the Communist government has refused to allow the Vatican to freely appoint bishops in county.

The agreement signed in 2018 ushered in a change.

It allows dioceses, with the participation of State authorities, to select candidates for the episcopate. But the pope retains the final word in the appointment.

However, there are still obstacles, notably as regards to the obligation or not for bishops and priests to join the Patriotic Association of Chinese Catholics, which is linked to the Communist Party.

Last June, in its pastoral guidelines for the Chinese clergy, the Vatican asked China for "a guarantee to respect the conscience and deep Catholic convictions of the people", while considering that Chinese priests and bishops can register before the authorities "without disloyalty to the principles of Catholic doctrine".

"China is willing to further improve understanding and mutual trust with the Vatican, so that the momentum of positive interaction between the two sides continues to grow," said the People's Daily.

Truncated or partial information

The Chinese authorities fear the rise of Evangelicals in their country more than the expansion of Catholicism.

The Evangelicals are much more numerous and often closely linked with their American co-religionists. And while China and the United States are locked in a trade war and vie for political influence, the Evangelicals are spreading the Gospel to the rest of the world.

Donald Trump resolutely relies on the Evangelicals for his re-election. And they draw on truncated or partial information to issue the harshest attacks against Beijing's rigid policies to regulate religion.

These same attacks are being repeated by Catholics who oppose Pope Francis and criticize him for signing the 2018 agreement with the Chinese communists.
