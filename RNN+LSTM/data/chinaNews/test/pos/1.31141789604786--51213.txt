China's ambassador in South Africa Lin Songtian says measures are in place to ensure that suspected cases of the deadly coronavirus on the continent do not spread to South Africa.

"My eye is open on the continent, South Africa and China have been in contact and I assure you there are measures in place to ensure that the virus does not cross the border." He briefed the media at the Chinese Embassy in Pretoria on Monday.

Songtian was responding to a query on the suspected case of the coronavirus in Botswana, which borders South Africa.

On Friday, News24 reported that Botswana had registered its first suspected case of the coronavirus at Gaborone's Sir Seretse Khama International Airport.This comes after a passenger travelling from China arrived at the airport on an Ethiopian Airways flight.

"Foreign nationals in China are our friends, we have hospitals in place and enough supplies.

"Trust China, give the hand to us – give us the confidence and strength and trust that you are safe, the system is working," he said.

While Songtian could not confirm how many Chinese nationals were currently in South Africa, he clarified that those who travelled to China for the holidays had been requested "to stay there for now".
