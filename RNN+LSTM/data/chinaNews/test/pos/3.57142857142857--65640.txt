A cargo ship crew member is being tested for coronavirus after docking at Port of Hastings on Monday, after a journey from China.

A spokesman from Victoria's Department of Health and Human Services said the man had fallen sick with a "mild illness" and was being tested for novel coronavirus as a precaution.

He was taken from the ship to hospital on Monday. If the man tests positive for the virus, it would be the fifth case recorded in Victoria.

Victorian health authorities say there is a low likelihood the man is infected, because he had not disembarked when the ship docked in China and it had been more than 14 days before symptoms developed. Test results are expected later on Tuesday.
