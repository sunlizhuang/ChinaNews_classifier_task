Existing tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods coming into the US are likely to stay in place until after the American presidential election, and any move to reduce them will hinge on Beijing’s compliance with the terms of a phase-one trade accord, people familiar with the matter said, Bloomberg reports.

The two sides have an understanding that no sooner than 10 months after the signing of the agreement at the White House Wednesday, the U.S. will review progress and potentially consider additional cuts on tariffs affecting US$360 billion of imports from China, the people said, declining to be identified because the matter is private.

The period of review, which isn’t expected to be specified in the deal’s text, is intended to give the Trump administration time to verify China's adherence to the terms of the pact.

It won’t affect a halving of the 15 percent tariff on about US$120 billion in Chinese goods announced in December that is still due to go ahead.

The Chinese Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a fax seeking comment.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, speaking to reporters Tuesday evening, denied that there was any path for China to win U.S. tariff relief before the two countries reach a phase-two accord.

He added that there was no link between the timeline for tariff reductions and the November election.

“These tariffs will stay in place until there’s a phase two. If the president gets a phase two quickly, he’ll consider releasing tariffs as part of phase two,” Mnuchin said. “If not, there won’t be any tariff relief. So it has nothing to do with the election or anything else. There’s no secret agreements.”

Officials have said before they will release the text of the 86-page agreement in conjunction with the signing and denied that there’s a plan to cut duties further.

“The only non-public component of the agreement is a confidential annex with detailed purchase amounts, which has been previously described,” U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Mnuchin said in a joint emailed response to questions earlier Tuesday. “There are no other oral or written agreements between the U.S. and China on these matters, and there is no agreement for future reduction in tariffs.”

Administration officials have played down any negative impact that the tariffs are having on the U.S. economy.

In a column for the Wall Street Journal published on Tuesday, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said mainstream economists including at the Federal Reserve were failing to account properly for what he said were the beneficial economic effects of the duties.

“Americans should welcome this analysis warmly -- especially in the heartland, where the ugly predictions of the anti-tariff forecasters seem so out of touch with the beautiful realities of the Trump economy,” he wrote.

In recent days, the administration has also been working in other ways to lay the groundwork for the deal and the negotiations on stickier issues such as China’s vast system of industrial subsidies that are expected to be included in the next phase of talks.
