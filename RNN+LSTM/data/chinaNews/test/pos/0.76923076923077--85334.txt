In 20 years of seeing psychologists, I'd never spoken to one from a non-English speaking background.

Then two years ago I went to hospital for depression.

It was simply luck that the hospital assigned me to a Chinese-Australian psychiatrist, who later recommended a Chinese-Australian psychologist.

It sounds silly, but I'd never thought to look for a psychologist with a similar background to my own.

I had, however, noticed that it often took the greater part of each hour-long session to explain my upbringing, my relationship with my parents, and my family dynamics.

At times I felt like I was giving the psychologist a guided tour called Depressed Eldest Child of Immigrant Parents in Australia. ("If you look out the window on your left, there's the Mountain of Responsibility!")

It left very little time each hour to discuss helpful strategies to manage depression.

The absence of cultural understanding

Kalpani* is a Sri Lankan Australian and was 25 when she first went to see a psychologist.

"The psychologists I've been to have never really understood the filial piety, high-achieving, model migrant thing," she says.

"A lot seemed to think my parents just needed to change their attitude and that I needed to reinforce my independence from them — which doesn't really work in a non-Western culture."

Kalpani is 36 now and the last time she saw a psychologist was two years ago when she had postnatal depression.

"She specifically dealt with postnatal depression, so she was great for that time, but once that episode was over, the therapy didn't really carry over to my general life."

When identity matters

When it comes to counselling, the consulting room is the patient's space, not the therapist's space, says Ros Knight, psychologist and president of the Australian Psychological Society.

"The therapist shouldn't [bring biases or judgements into] the room."

So, in theory, it shouldn't matter if you or your psychologist speak the same language.

"But when you're starting to address more complex issues, particularly ones that might be more social in nature, more values driven and about why we make decisions, and how we make decisions, then yes, it does make a difference."

Adjunct professor Tracy Westerman is a Nyamal woman from the Pilbara region of Western Australia and a world leader in Indigenous mental health.

She says psychologists have a massive advantage when they share culture in common with a client.

"Because you've got all those things around worldview … and there's a lot of things that you as a client don't have to explain."

Finding a therapist who understands your worldview

The psychiatrist at the hospital and I were very different.

She spoke Mandarin and I spoke Cantonese; her elegant clothes fit like couture, while my hospital uniform was a flannelette shirt, jeans and ugg boots.

But when we sat across from each other, I felt an ease that I hadn't felt before with a clinician.

I no longer had to explain things in great detail. Instead, we drew from a shared pool of understanding when it came to the immigrant experience and stressors that arise from this.

To my surprise, my Chineseness was also relevant when it came to trying various medications in order to get the dosage right.

The psychiatrist explained that I might need a smaller amount than the suggested dosage because East Asians can metabolise drugs more slowly than Caucasians.

Of course, it was a combination of her clinical excellence and cultural background that contributed to the quality of healthcare — it wasn't simply the fact that she was Chinese.

It's the same now for the Chinese-Australian psychologist I see. She's a very experienced clinical psychologist who just happens to be able to draw on her experience as an immigrant if it comes up in the consulting room.

The increase in tacit communication means there's more time in each session to talk about problem-solving and depression management strategies.

And it's much less exhausting for me as a patient now because I no longer have to play tour guide. ("If you look out the window to your right, there's the Pool of Understanding…")
