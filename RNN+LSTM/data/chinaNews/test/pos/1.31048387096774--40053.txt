Grōv Technologies launches indoor growing system for animal feed

Grōv Technologies has announced its indoor, fully-automated animal feed production system, called the Grōv Pod, which is a controlled environment agriculture system that uses less than 2% of the water and a fraction of the land needed for traditional farming. According to the company, the Grōv Pod, which is in beta testing, produces a daily output of more than 2 tonnes of wheat or barley grass, equivalent to the annual approximate yield of at least 55 acres of farm land. The system has been designed to require minimal labour and utilises low-heat LED technology, robotic seed-to-harvest systems and scientifically proven growing protocols.

Darling Ingredients acquires 100% of EnviroFlight

Darling Ingredients has acquired the 50% joint venture interest of EnviroFlight owned by Intrexon Corporation, thereby increasing its ownership interest to 100%. EnviroFlight is a developer of proprietary technologies which enable the rearing of non-pathogenic black soldier fly (BSF) larvae in a scalable manner.

Growing insects for specialty feed ingredients yields 10 times the usable protein per acre compared to producing algae and is at least 50 times the protein per acre compared to soy, according to Randall C. Stuewe, chairman and CEO of Darling Ingredients. Photo: Darling Ingredients
