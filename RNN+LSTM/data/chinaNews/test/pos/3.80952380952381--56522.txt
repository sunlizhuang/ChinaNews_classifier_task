Stuff asked kids and teenagers about their favourite dishes at the opening night of the Night Noodle Markets at Hagley Park in Christchurch.

Children love dumplings.

That was the verdict among an estimated 12,000-strong crowd sampling some of Christchurch's best Asian cuisine on the opening night of the city's annual Night Noodle Markets on Thursday.

The markets, being held over 12 nights at Hagley Park, have become increasingly popular among Cantabrians looking to tuck in to everything from noodles and dumplings to wontons and Korean tacos.

ALDEN WILLIAMS/STUFF Maia Gallegos, 6, was very impressed with the dumplings at the Night Noodle Markets.

Toby Chapman, 7, agreed vegetable dumplings were the winning dish at the market, although he was very impressed with the wide variety of food on offer.

Brothers Peter McHaffie, 6, and Michael McHaffie, 8, were also big fans of the dumplings. It was the choice of different fillings that made them so alluring, they said.

While dumplings seemed to reign supreme among the youngsters, others were filling up on Chinese crepes, spring rolls, rotis, barbecue skewers, sticky rice and noodle soup. This year market-goers can choose from 21 local and international food stalls serving up traditional and modern fare, with gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan options.
