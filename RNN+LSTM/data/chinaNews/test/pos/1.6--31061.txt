China is facing a massive health crisis right now. At the time of writing, more than 100 people have died as a result of the coronavirus respiratory disease and more than 4,500 are infected. The situation is so serious that several cities are under quarantine. Public transport links have also been shut down in some cities to prevent the deadly virus from spreading.

With no access to public transport, people in affected cities will be relying heavily on their cars to get around. To help make their lives easier during this difficult time, Tesla is offering its Chinese customers free Supercharging for all vehicles including the Model 3, Model S, and Model X.
