January turned out to be a decent month for U.S. auto sales, as year-over-year gains were recorded across the board by firms that unveiled monthly sales reports. Nonetheless, one will not be able to get a clear picture of how U.S. auto sales are progressing, as sector biggies like BMW, Volkswagen and Nissan will henceforth announce quarterly sales like Detroit 3 carmakers.

Healthy demand for crossovers and light trucks aided January U.S. auto sales of various firms. For instance, January U.S. auto sales rose 5.2%, 17.8%, 8%, 5.1% and 22% at Volvo, Mazda, Kia, Hyundai and Mitsubishi, respectively. While U.S. auto sales of Japan’s top carmaker Toyota Motor TM recorded a 6.3% rise, that of its close rival Honda Motor HMC declined 4.1% year over year.

Therefore, the company is working toward securing battery-production capacity from several suppliers, since this rise in deliveries will require more batteries. Tesla had also signed an agreement last August with South Korea’s LG Chem Ltd. in order to source batteries for the Gigafactory 3 in China. Tesla will work with both CATL and LG Chem, in addition to its long-time partner Panasonic. (Read more: Tesla Signs Battery-Supply Agreement With China's CATL)
