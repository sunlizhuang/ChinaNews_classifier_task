Amid the international intrigue inspired by an inquiry of legitimate concern — Are we all going to die? — let’s look at one former Austinite’s tale of international inconvenience.

Regular readers of this newspaper, as well as most Earthlings, are aware of the coronavirus crisis. To date, it’s killed more than 2,000 people in China.

That’s where my friend Richard Dunham, a respected journalist and former Austinite, lives and works, as does his wife Pam Tobey, a former American-Statesman graphic artist.

He’s been in Beijing since September 2013 when Dunham, a former longtime Washington journalist, took his skills to China as co-director of the Global Business Journalism program at Beijing’s prestigious Tsinghua University. (And yes, he teaches in English.) Tobey, who now works for the Beijing Review, an English-language news weekly, joined him in 2015 when she retired from The Washington Post.

I’ve had the pleasure and interesting experience of speaking to Dunham’s classes during two visits to his current hometown. It was great, as has Dunham and Tobey’s life been in Beijing. It’s an experience they probably never envisioned when he was growing up in Philadelphia and she was growing up in Silsbee in Southeast Texas.

"As soon as I heard of the coronavirus outbreak in mid-January," Dunham told me, "I knew that my life and my students’ lives would be significantly disrupted."

The news broke while he was back in the U.S., where he lives in Arlington, Va., during semester break. He arrived in the U.S. on Dec. 23 and planned a Feb. 10 return to Beijing. He’s still stuck stateside, far from his Beijing classroom and students.

"The first Chinese media reports were upbeat and incomplete, but it was clear that this epidemic was out of control," Dunham said, adding that he foresaw the challenge ahead.

"Half of my students are Chinese, the other half live in more than 20 countries around the world," he said. "I found out where they were and how they were doing. They were all healthy and surprisingly calm."

So he focused on how, unable to get back to China, to resume class post-semester break.

"Some of my colleagues were unrealistically optimistic about getting back to school because of the upbeat tone of the Chinese media coverage," he told me, noting that one Chinese colleague figured there’d be a delay of a week or two, tops.

Dunham figured otherwise. He was correct. You can lose a lot of money betting against a veteran journalist’s instincts.

The school posted this on Feb. 1: "Tsinghua University is implementing a range of measures to prevent and control the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. During this period, students have been advised to postpone their return to the University."

Then this on Feb. 4. "At Tsinghua, spring semester begins online. Over 50,000 Tsinghua students, faculty, staff members and alumni representatives used their laptops and smartphones to attend the first class of the 2020 spring semester."

The notice included photos of three university officials speaking at a lectern and wearing masks.

Dunham and his colleagues faced additional challenges in getting a distance learning system up and running. One of the challenges is that we live on a large planet and his students are scattered around it.

"My students are spread out over 19 time zones," he told me. "It was almost impossible to find a time that would work for everyone. We settled on 8 a.m. in Washington, which is 2 p.m. for my students in France and Spain; 3 p.m. in South Africa; 5 p.m. in Oman; 9 p.m. in China and western Australia; and 10 p.m. in Japan and Korea. Thank goodness my students are flexible and adventurous."

So that was the logistical challenge. There also was the technology challenge. Tsinghua worked toward a proprietary online learning platform, but, as Dunham reports, "Beta tests showed it wasn’t ready for prime time."

Or, I suppose, any of the 19 times zones in which his students live.

This is where the Iowa Democratic caucuses get involved. Dunham said the epic fail there cemented the notion of advance, intense testing of apps and platforms. A few were tried. Zoom, a popular conferencing app, was the winner and Tsinghua and Zoom’s Chinese subsidiary reached an agreement to let the students use it for free until June.

"Then we were ready for classes," Dunham reports. "Or so we thought."

Perhaps you’re aware that stuff doesn’t always work right. In this case, the limiting variable is the varying limits of internet connections. "The internet in Oman and China is not as reliable as in the U.S., France and Japan," Dunham has discovered.

"But our class was an educational triumph," he told me of Monday’s first session, conducted from his dining room table in Arlington, Va. "Students could see me, hear me, see my PowerPoint presentations, see articles that I had called up on my computer screen for analysis in my Advanced News Writing class."

So, so far, so good. And Dunham remains bullish on this, but he’s also a realist.

"I’m taking this one week at a time. We could have a technological meltdown any week now," he told me. "But I am cautiously optimistic. And I am looking for the silver linings in this dark cloud. For one thing, I can now easily ask prominent journalists, academics or policymakers to join our class in real time."

Of course, that real time really could be 8 a.m. in Washington, 5 p.m. in Oman and 9 p.m. in western Australia.

Dunham says one of his Texas friends offered this enduring advice for when things go sour: "Lemonade, Rick. Lemonade."

"I am so happy to be at home in the United States," he said. "I think I would go mad being forced to stay inside my (Beijing) apartment, with only one trip out every two days."

I’ve been to that apartment. Point well taken.

FYI, Tobey is working remotely from Silsbee at her mom’s house. Her dad passed away in December.

Dunham says he can’t stop thinking about the suffering being endured by his friends and students in China. "I think of them and talk to them every day," he said.

With that in mind, I was happy to send him a link to a story this week by my colleague Lara Korte that was headlined: "UT researchers make ‘critical breakthrough’ in coronavirus vaccine."

"Thanks," Dunham replied. "I passed the story along to some colleagues and students. This is the best news of the day."

Here’s hoping our local university’s marketing catchphrase proves true in this case: "What starts here," we’ve been told, "changes the world."
