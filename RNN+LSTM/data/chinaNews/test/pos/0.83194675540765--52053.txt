President Donald Trump delivered the State of the Union address Tuesday, a day before U.S. senators are set to vote on whether to convict or acquit him on two articles of impeachment.

Trump gave the speech in the chamber where in December the House voted to impeach him on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was seen tearing up her copy of the speech after Trump had finished speaking.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer gave the Democratic response to the president’s speech. Whitmer highlighted “what Democrats are doing," as she talked about health care and infrastructure repairs.
