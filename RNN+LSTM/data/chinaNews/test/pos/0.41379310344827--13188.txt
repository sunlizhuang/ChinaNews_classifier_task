Live lobster and crab companies in Europe and North America are in a last dash to fulfill orders for Chinese New Year on Jan. 26.

Six to seven air cargo flights are departing each week for Asia from Halifax, Nova Scotia, and two from Moncton, New Brunswick, Stewart Lamont, managing director of Tangier Lobster Company, a lobster exporter based in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, told Undercurrent News earlier this week.

“I would describe demand as extraordinarily strong for larger-sized Canadian lobster, meaning 900 grams and up," he said. Read also Chinese shrimp importers, farmers bemoan oversupply before Spring Festival

Some 1,800 Canadian vessels are fishing for lobster on Canada's east coast, he said. Notwithstanding slightly lower production of large-sized lobsters, supply is comparable with last year.

"Larger sizes account for no more than 7-8% of landings. That is the great challenge currently," said Lamont, adding that Chinese buyers would take triple the amount of the large-sized crustaceans if they were available.

This has opened a gap in prices for large- and small-sized lobsters, with Chinese demand for the latter described as mediocre.

“The current gap [compared with smaller sizes] is about CAD 4.00 ($3.07) per pound. That's about as wide a gap between a one-pound compared with a two-to-four-pound [lobster] as we ever see," he said.

Lamont said flights would continue right up to Chinese New Year, on Jan. 26, and throughout the festival period.

"There will be flights to Asia on the 26th, 27th, 28th. There are flights to China every week of the year," he said.

Meanwhile, fishermen in Nova Scotia are getting CAD 10/lb, or even slightly higher, at the docks.

“It varies by area but that's about the price," Lamont reported. "But of what they're catching, 20-35% of that is either softshell, medium shell or single claw. We [processors] kind of overpay on the shore relative to the supply of desirable lobsters and what price the smaller lobsters will command."

China's monthly lobster imports peak before Chinese New Year. In January 2019, China imported 2,344 metric tons of live or fresh lobster; in February 2018, when the festival was later, 2,400t; in January 2017, 1,976t. All were monthly highs for the corresponding year bar 2019.

China's live and chilled lobster imports were up 10% in volume and 9% in value to 20,200t and $435.6 million in the first eleven months of last year, according to the latest available Chinese customs data, compared with the same period in 2018. However, imports from the US were down 91% year-on-year over the period to 499t, thanks to Chinese tariffs, with imports from Canada up 53% y-o-y to 19,700t (see chart one).

China focus for Netherlands brown crab packer

Elsewhere, in the Netherlands, Rotterdam-based firm Le Petit Pecheur is busy fulfilling a packing contract for an Irish-Dutch-UK crab company for export to China, owner Jaco Dingemanse, told Undercurrent.

The firm’s 20 factory staff are packing 30t of live brown crab per week for export, primarily to the Chinese market.

“At the moment we are packing for a firm landing crab caught in UK and Dutch waters in the Netherlands. It wants to be close to the market,” he said. On LinkedIn, Dingemanse posted a video of crab being packed in polystyrene boxes in his firm's warehouse.

Landing prices for brown crab are €10-12/kg, which he described as relatively good. “Pricing and the market is always good before Chinese New Year,” he said.

In the January-November period, China imported 5,516t of live, fresh or chilled crab from the Netherlands, Ireland and UK combined, up 29% compared with the corresponding period in 2018.

Chinese imports of Norwegian fresh Atlantic salmon are less impressive, however.

In the four weeks ending Jan. 5 Norway exported 781t of fresh, head-on Atlantic salmon to China, down 22% compared with the same four-week period last year, according to data from the Norwegian Seafood Council.

Several Chinese salmon importers did not respond to requests for comment but high prices could be a factor; in week 52, 2019, the average unit value of Norway’s fresh salmon exports to China was NOK 103/kg ($11.61/kg), up 35% compared with the same week in 2018.

One of China's largest salmon importers recently told Undercurrent that industry forecasts for Chinese salmon consumption are "wide of the mark", because high salmon prices are stifling growth.
