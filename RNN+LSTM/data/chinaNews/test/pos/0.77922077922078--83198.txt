A common refrain in times of crisis is the idea that a community bands together, effectively rising above any and all challenges to come out the other side, stronger than ever. This, of course, has been the case in Beijing’s teaching communities since COVID-19’s rapid and unpredictable development, which all but brought the country to its knees.

With so many foreigners and locals away for the Spring Festival holiday, further hindered by flight cancellations and quarantine procedures, focus quickly turned to Beijing’s massive population of expat teachers. While some went West to spend the long break with friends and family, others found refuge in the warm, tropical climates of Southeast Asia.

Unfortunately, however, no one could have predicted the move to online learning, and just how long this whole thing was going to drag out. As such, some teachers have been bending over backward to ensure that learning doesn’t slow down for their students and that those students continue to have the support and mental stimulus they need.

Working from an Airbnb in Bali, Drew, who preferred not to disclose his full name and the name of his school, tells [the Beijinger's sister publication] beijingkids that he had been vacationing “in a much different time zone, so decided to come to Bali for better timing with my students,” where he’s been stationed for the last 11 days.

When asked if he had brought his laptop on vacation, Drew explains that he hadn’t, and instead had to resort to buying a new iPad, a purchase he admits he had been contemplating for a while. Nevertheless, the timing wasn’t ideal. “Purchasing an iPad was an unforeseen expense coming at the end of a long vacation,” says Drew.

Conversely, Bill Weydig, an AP English and Literature teacher at Rendafuzhong, Renmin University’s affiliated high school, was lucky enough to have brought his laptop when he left for Bangkok a few weeks ago. Moreover, he was lucky enough to have a friend who lives there, and who offered his house up as a temporary “classroom” for Weydig’s work.

Unfortunately, however, for both Drew and Weydig, getting themselves in front of a screen was only half the battle. The other half was accessing the necessary materials to conduct their lessons.

“Originally I didn’t have many resources to work with,” says Drew, “but I have amazing coworkers who have shared materials I can use.”

Likewise, Weydig says that it’s been easy enough to find online versions for most of his textbooks, adding, “There are a few supplemental texts that will require substitutes, but otherwise I feel pretty well prepared.”

Unlike Drew, Weydig didn’t need to migrate to a closer timezone when online learning began, although both are keeping a close eye on when they can return to the city.

“I’ve already been here two weeks, that was all I’d originally planned on, but obviously circumstances have changed that,” says Weydig. “My return flight was originally scheduled for Feb 13, but I canceled it. I am planning on a minimum extended stay of two more weeks, but that could change, depending on the state of things. I hope to be back by mid-March at the latest.”

Drew, on the other hand, is looking at tentative plans to fly back this weekend. Ultimately, however, he’s taking it “day by day.”

When asked how their students were making the transition to e-learning, both teachers were more than pleased.

“We’re in week two of classes. So far it’s been good,” says Drew. “Students seem truly happy getting back to a routine and seeing their friends, even if it is just on a screen.”

When asked about the setbacks, Drew admits, "It’s had its challenging moments in terms of planning and getting everyone’s mics and cameras working, due to differing internet speeds depending on where everyone is, but I’m happy with what we’ve done so far."

Weydig echos a similar sentiment. "I was happy to see how prepared and focused [the students] were right off the bat. They’re motivated to learn. I think they need intellectual stimulation right now, and getting back to class, even if it’s in an unconventional form, has provided that."

Both teachers understand that to be in the same, or at least a relatively close, timezone is something of a blessing, given that they have colleagues and students operating at a time difference upwards of 13 hours.

Nevertheless, despite finding themselves hunkered down in the beauty of Bali and Bangkok, even the most idyllic paradise can lose its luster given the right, or wrong, circumstances.
