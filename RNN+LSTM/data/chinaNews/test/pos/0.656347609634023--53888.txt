As the earnings season gets on and companies start reporting their results from Q4 2019, Wall Street’s analysts are taking note and declaring the winners. It’s not hard to determine which stocks are getting the seal of approval – those companies forecasting or reporting strong earnings.

We’ve used TipRanks’ Daily Stock Ratings tool to take a closer look at three companies which have just seen ratings upgrades from top analysts. An upgrade is an important signal for investors to note – it shows that the stock in question has deeply impressed the reviewing analyst.

The three companies on this list are Buy-rated, with medium to large market caps, and boast upwards of 15% upside growth potential. Let’s dive in and find out why they earned coveted upgrades.

General Electric Company (GE)

First up is a long-time stalwart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. General Electric is a multinational manufacturing conglomerate, with segments in aviation, digital industry, finance, power, renewable energy, and venture capital, to name just a few. The company saw over $121 billion in revenues for fiscal 2018, and employs over a quarter of a million people worldwide. Despite various industry and financial headwinds that pushed share prices down in 2018 and 2019, GE remains a blue-chip stock and a staple of the markets.

The fourth quarter of 2019, reported just last week, marked a possible turnaround for the company. Earnings and revenues both beat the forecasts. The top line number, at $26.2 billion, was 2.6% better than expected, while the 21-cent EPS beat the estimates by over 16%. An important metric, the company reported free cash flow of $2.3 billion for the year, beating its own guidance by 1.5%. The strong quarterly release has pushed GE shares to a 13% gain year-to-date.

Andrew Obin, 4-star analyst from Merrill Lynch, was pleased with GE’s results. He wrote, “The company has undergone a significant reinvestment cycle, positioning it well from a competitive standpoint. The improving FCF trajectory should be supportive for shares.”

Obin bumped up his rating on GE from Neutral to Buy, and raised the price target from $12 to $16, suggesting a robust 27% upside potential. (To watch Obin’s track record, click here)

With 15 analyst ratings given recently, including 10 Buys, 4 Holds, and a single Sell, GE stock gets a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus. Shares are priced low, at just $12.58, but the $14.23 average price target indicates room for 13% upside growth in the coming 12 months. (See General Electric stock analysis on TipRanks)

Micron Technology, Inc. (MU)

Micron is a major player in the semiconductor chip industry, with its $31.8 billion in sales in 2018 making it the fifth largest chip maker. Like much of the industry, Micron has been heavily pressured by the US-China trade tensions – the company’s manufacturing and supply lines are highly dependent on the free movement of goods, materials, components, and completed products between the US and China. The recent positive developments on that front, including the signing of the Phase 1 agreement between the US and Chinese governments, has relieved some of that pressure.

The pressure, however, has been real. MU’s earnings are down significantly from a year ago. The company responded by lowering guidance on fiscal Q1 2020. In the recent report for that quarter, MU beat the lower guidance as well as the Street’s estimates on revenues and earnings – it was a good sign for Micron. Revenues were reported at $5.14 billion, 2.5% above expectations, and EPS, at 48 cents, edged out the forecast by 2%.
