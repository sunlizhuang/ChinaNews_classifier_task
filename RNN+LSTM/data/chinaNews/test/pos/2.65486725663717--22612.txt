Philip Grant, chair of the foundation’s board of trustees, said: “The response to our new programmes has been fantastic and our emphasis on social exclusion and disadvantage means that they can continue to help to improve the lives of many vulnerable people across Scotland addressing areas such as homelessness, debt management, reducing isolation and supporting job creation.

“We know that core funding is hugely important for charities, providing stability and reducing uncertainty, and we are proud to be one of few funders to make this commitment.”
