She then bagged a role at Afiniti, a California-based AI company, sitting on the company's advisory board, which is chaired by Mr Cameron.

In mid-2019 she founded her own consulting company Julie Bishop & Partners, whose one-page website promises "strategies, insights and solutions". Her former ministerial chief of staff, Murray Hansen, has joined her as a principal in the firm.

Then in August she was announced as the new chancellor of the Australian National University, a job that started this month. She is also active on the corporate speaking front.

Greensill, which was set up in 2011, last year received a pair of funding injections worth a combined $2.1 billion from Japanese investor SoftBank, which is helping drive its regional push.

The company is in the midst of applying for licences to operate in China and India, and is looking to base its Chinese operation out of Shenzhen.

Greensill's core business involves earning a fee and interest for paying a company's suppliers upfront, which bolsters their cash flow and working capital, and collecting the payments from the company later.

The company says that in 2019 it serviced 8 million suppliers across 165 countries, involving $US150 billion ($217 billion) of finance.

Based on its acquisition of FreeUp last October, it's now also kicking off a related service in which a company's employees can draw on their fortnightly or monthly salary cheque before payday comes around.

Ms Bishop hailed the model's potential to "transform relationships throughout the world's complex supply chains".

"I look forward to working with Greensill to ensure such opportunities can be provided across developed and developing countries," she said.

The company has beefed up its offices in Bundaberg and Sydney, and just before Christmas said it would add another 227 jobs at its Warrington tech campus in north-west England, near Manchester.

Greensill is headquartered in London, and opened an Asia-Pacific HQ in Singapore early last month. It also has offices in New York, Frankfurt, Chicago, Miami, Sao Paulo, Mexico City and Johannesburg.
