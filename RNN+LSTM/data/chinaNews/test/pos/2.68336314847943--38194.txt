Best bet for the DPP in second term

By Vincent Chen 陳建志





The Jan. 11 elections captivated the nation. The decisive results were in no small part influenced by the wide participation and high voter turnout among young Taiwanese, which allowed President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) to roundly defeat Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜), the Chinese Nationalist Party’s (KMT) candidate, and secure a second term and a majority in the legislature for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).

Here are some suggestions for Tsai and her party on how best to manage their second term:

First, Tsai must establish a common vision for Taiwan’s future — a shared destiny that is accepted by all Taiwanese.

Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) delivered a speech on Jan. 2 last year, in which he explicitly stated that accepting the so-called “1992 consensus” means that Taiwan must also accept a Hong Kong-style “one country, two systems” model of governance.

The statement was a clear rejection of long-standing KMT cross-strait policy, which interprets the “1992 consensus” to mean “one China, each side having its own interpretation of what China means.”

This means that, irrespective of whether Taiwanese identify as belonging to a country called “Taiwan” or the “Republic of China” (ROC), Beijing now views both as forms of Taiwanese independence.

Moreover, despite the wild catastrophism of some Taiwanese politicians, the ROC remains intact, despite 12 years of DPP rule.

Accordingly, Tsai’s overriding objective over the next four years will be to unite the pro-Taiwan and the ROC political factions.

With the People’s Republic of China (PRC) hell-bent on annexing Taiwan and the KMT having long ago surrendered, it is time that Taiwanese united.

Second, Tsai must ensure that Taiwan takes an international outlook and adheres to the highest universal values and standards.

A new international situation has taken shape as the US has redefined China as a “strategic competitor,” and the US-China trade dispute is just one aspect of this new situation. After Washington delineated the Indo-Pacific as a key strategic area of influence, democratic Taiwan’s role in the region became indispensable.

Taiwan’s geostrategic value lies not just in its position within the so-called “first island chain,” but also its democratic form of government, liberal values and human rights, which make Taiwan a natural ally of the US, Europe, Japan, Australia and other countries.

Taiwan also serves as a role model for burgeoning democracies and developing nations around the world.

Tsai must turn up the volume and find ways to more clearly communicate the universal values that underpin Taiwan’s democracy to the rest of the world.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ “Taiwan Can Help” program to promote the nation’s full participation in international organizations has encouraged young Taiwanese to participate in civil society, while showing the wider world that Taiwan is an indispensable global partner.

Third, Tsai’s administration must build a society for all generations.

The younger generation has already become an important force for the protection of Taiwan. The election saw a historic willingness to participate in public affairs, and protect democracy and freedom. It marked the coming of age of a new generation of altruistic Taiwanese, concerned for the greater good of society.

This generation was formed by the 2014 Sunflower movement, and culminated in the 2016 presidential and legislative elections.

The DPP’s setback in the 2018 local elections did not weaken its momentum, but was a timely warning of the fragility of Taiwan’s democracy and taught young people that even more like-minded people were needed to protect that democracy.

When this generation, which already possesses a strong international outlook, saw the courage and love displayed by Hong Kongers during their pro-democracy protests, they were deeply moved and felt a common bond.

Taiwanese society should cherish this generation of young people — they are a vital force for Taiwan to continue to improve itself and make its presence felt on the international stage.

The Tsai administration must ensure that it does more to support young Taiwanese, and resolve issues around employment and other areas where they face difficulty.

Fourth, the Tsai administration should use its second term to rebuild political standards.

Tsai’s victory is particularly significant because it was, on one level, a rejection of the negative aspects of Han’s brand of politics. Over the past year, Han’s integrity, ability, character and attitude have challenged traditional Taiwanese notions of personal conduct and ethics. His defeat was not only a dismissal of Han himself and the KMT’s political manifesto, it was also an emphatic rejection of Han’s diminishment of Taiwan through his absurd behavior.

By manipulating social tensions, Han won over KMT supporters, military personnel, civil servants and public-school teachers, and forced pan-blue camp intellectuals and economists to hold their noses and lend their vote to him on election day.

Hopefully, pan-blue camp supporters will leave behind the politics of hatred and put the animosity of the elections behind them.

Democratic elections should be carnivals of peace and reason. Elections are won by politicians and parties who conduct positive campaigns, and it should be a process involving rational arguments and positive values. Politicians with an eye on the future should heed the warnings of this election.

Now that the elections are over, it is vital to put aside prejudices, and embrace family members and politicians so that people come together as a nation to resolve challenges.

Contrasted with China, Taiwan is a small country and therefore cannot afford to become disunited. On the other hand, measured against the world, Taiwan is a sizable nation, as long as its liberal democracy and human rights persist.
