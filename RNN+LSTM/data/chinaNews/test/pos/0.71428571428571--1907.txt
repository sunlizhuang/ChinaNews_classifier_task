After a full “Year of the Rat” collection was recently unveiled by Nike and Jordan Brand, the Jumpman is continuing its celebratory stylings with a new Air Jordan 1 Low “Chinese New Year.” With an original last, a bold patchwork style and asymmetrical colorblocking, this low-cut Air Jordan 1 is a simultaneous nod to the year ahead and CNY collections of years past.

Each panel opts for a different printed graphic, several of which are undoubtedly familiar to fans of previous CNY collections. “Firework” and “Wind Kite” patterns alternate between toeboxes and lateral quarters on each foot, while the “Bai Jia Yi” arrangement introduced in 2019’s “Year of the Pig” capsule appears on the medial Swooshes. Floral decorations accompany each “Firework” panel, and sharp-eyed observers may also spot the embossed Chinese coin graphic from the recently released Air Jordan 13 “CNY” on the left shoe’s medial quarter.

Apart from all the patterns, the remainder of the shoe’s overlays are an experiment in texture. Materials as far-ranging as classic smooth black leather and shaggy grey suede are present, while a ridged patent leather with a construction reminiscent of Chinese sky lanterns graces the heels. Even the insoles get in on the action, boomeranging between pink on the left foot and a repeating white and black print on the right. White midsoles proffer a semblance of similarity, while alternating laces and outsoles complete the look.

The Air Jordan 1 Low “Chinese New Year” will release via Nike SNKRS CN on January 10 for ¥1,099 CNY (approximately $158 USD).

Elsewhere in the expansive world of the Swoosh, the new VaporMax 360 has released in a recognizable “History of Air” colorway.
