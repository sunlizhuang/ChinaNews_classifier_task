The first Arab robot doctor has been launched in the name of ‘Shifa’ (healing) to provide consultations to both doctors and patients at the same time, said Dr. Waleed Daraghmeh, founder of Wiltech Technology Company.

The robot doctor speaks three languages - Arabic, English and Chinese - and patients can review and update their files through voice conferencing with the robot, he added.

Daraghmeh explained that ‘Shifa’ will be upgraded in future by adding new languages to enable other patients to talk with it easily, adding that the robot doctor will be provided this year to all government hospitals across the UAE.

The robot doctor will be connected with a database to a number of specialized centres worldwide to provide answers and information to doctors and patients.
