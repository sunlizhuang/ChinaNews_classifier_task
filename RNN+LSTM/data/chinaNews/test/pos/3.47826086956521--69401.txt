WITH more than 100 items on its menu, there is definitely something for everybody at a new Chinese-Muslim restaurant in Seremban’s Oasis Business Centre. Restoran Teratai Indah serves up various Chinese-style dishes catering to Muslims.The restaurant, which is in the process of getting its halal certification, has a kitchen team helmed by cooks with decades of experience in Chinese-Muslim cooking.Head cook Muhd Adam Tan, who has been in the culinary line for over a decade-and-a-half, said the restaurant is one of the few places in Seremban that offers Muslim-friendly Chinese-style dishes.“As a Muslim, I know it is difficult to find a Chinese restaurant serving halal Chinese fare. It may be why we have had a surge of customers since opening day,” he said.The spacious restaurant features 10 VIP rooms, including two with karaoke systems as well as two banquet halls.Able to accommodate up to 350 guests at a time, the restaurant is an ideal venue for birthdays, company dinners and weddings.For these events, guests have the option of choosing from the restaurant’s special occasion set dinner menu.The special menu has to be booked three days in advance and features three eight-course menu options priced between RM498 and RM1,288nett per table of 10.Highlights from the menus include Exquisite Four Combination – a platter of appetisers, including fresh scallops gently tossed with mixed veggies and crunchy deep-fried almond roll with prawn and fish paste filling; Western Style Prawn – prawns fried to a crisp and topped with a curry-leaf and chilli-flecked eggy floss; Deep-fried Grouper with Sweet and Sour Sauce; and Crispy Sesame Chicken with Fish Paste – sesame crusted crispy chicken skin with fish paste.Muhd Adam said quality was of utmost importance and that fresh fish and seafood were procured daily.“The freshness of the seafood and produce plays a big part in taste. We even make our sauces in-house,” he said, citing the sauce for their fried rice is made in-house with dried scallops.“It makes a real difference in taste,” he said.All dishes are accompanied by spicy sambal belacan made in-house.Muhd Adam said the belacan was a favourite with diners and a must-have with all the restaurant’s dishes.“Although the dishes we cook are inspired by Cantonese cooking, taste-wise, the flavours are also influenced by the Malaysian palate.“Sambal belacan adds a spicy kick, and is a crowd favourite,” he said.Besides its banquet menu, the restaurant also offers set lunch and dinner options as well as a la carte selections.Set lunch and dinner options include a four-course menu for two to four diners (RM98nett), a five-course menu for five to eight diners (RM208nett) and a seven-course menu for nine to 12 diners (RM368nett).The a la carte menu showcases a range of dishes, including Crispy Yam Ring with Dry Chilli Beef, Marmite Chicken, a selection of stir-fried and braised noodle dishes, Curry Fish Head, Fried Rice, Salted Egg Yolk Prawns, and Cheese Baked Prawns.Must-tries include the chef’s signature Hot Pot Seafood Special – a creamy curry broth filled to the brim with prawns, crab, squid and chicken meatballs.The flavourful dish reminiscent of curry laksa is served with mee hoon and blanched beansprouts.The hearty broth is made from a stock of salted fish bones, spices and Chinese herbs, as well as evaporated milk for creaminess.Another menu favourite is Double Combination Kailan which showcases the leafy green cooked two styles – stir-fried with garlic and deep-fried to a crisp.Restaurant F&B director Abdul Razak Othman said the eatery was a family-friendly place with affordable prices.“We have an extensive menu that caters to office workers, couples, families and those celebrating special occasions.“Another added bonus is our banquet halls. One fits 10 tables, while another private hall can accommodate six tables and there are no extra charges to book these rooms,” he said, adding that the restaurant would soon include prayer facilities for Muslims.
