Benelli India has revised the prices of the Imperiale 400, and the retro-style motorcycle is now available at INR 1,79,500. The company states that the material costs have gone up for the Imperiale 400, which has resulted in a price increase. The Imperiale 400 was launched in India at INR 1.69 lakh*. Do note that the vehicle is yet to receive BS-VI compliance, and the upgrade to comply with the latest emission norms could further affect the prices.

The Benelli Imperiale 400 has received a positive start in the Indian market, and the two-wheeler brand has received over 6,000 bookings (as on 12 January 2020). Benelli India offers the Royal Enfield Classic 350 rival in three colours â€“ Red, Black and Silver. Apart from the Royal Enfield Classic 350, the Benelli Imperiale 400 also competes with the Jawa range of motorcycles.

The budget-friendly hardware specifications are at par with its rivals, and the Benelli Imperiale 400 uses 41 mm conventional telescopic front forks at the front and preload-adjustable dual rear springs at the back to perform the shock absorption tasks. Anchoring power comes from disc brakes on both wheels, while the safety net includes a dual-channel ABS. Other features include halogen headlight, conventional blinkers and a semi-digital instrument console.

Engine specifications include a BS-IV compliant 373.5 cc single-cylinder, air-cooled, SOHC motor with fuel injection technology that delivers a peak power output of 21 PS at 5,500 rpm and a maximum torque of 29 Nm at 4,500 rpm. Benelli India is yet to reveal any launch timeline for the arrival of the BS-VI compliant model. The single-cylinder mill is paired with a five-speed gearbox.

With an aim to ensure a satisfactory ownership experience, the Benelli Imperiale 400 comes with a three-Year/unlimited-kilometre warranty as standard. The two-wheeler brand also offers complimentary service for the first two-years and an Annual Maintenance Contract.
