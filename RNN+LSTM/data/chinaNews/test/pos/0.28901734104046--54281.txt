Leicester’s hospitals have reassured residents that measures are in place should they need to treat patients with coronavirus.

A report set to go before health bosses later this week explains that the trust is ready to deal with outbreaks of infection.

Staff have been briefed and will continue to be updated as the situation develops.

So far two cases have been confirmed in the UK. Two members of the same family tested positive for the virus and are currently being treated at a hospital in Newcastle.

Last week, a Leicestershire patient claimed that local hospitals were not prepared to deal with potential cases of the disease - which originated in Wuhan, China.

But, in his monthly update to the Leicester hospital’s trust board, chief executive John Adler writes: “University Hospitals of Leicester already has plans in place to support staff respond to outbreaks of infection.

“These plans are reviewed and updated in line with the latest available guidance and direction from Public Health England who oversee the public health response.

“We are updating and briefing staff regularly as the situation evolves and our response plans are available for staff to access on a dedicated page on our intranet.

“Training is also underway to ensure clinical teams are well prepared.

“The ongoing outbreak is an evolving situation and our teams are working closely with our partners to ensure any response is coordinated and effective.”

The department for health and social care’s latest update said that as of February 4, a total of 416 UK tests have been carried out, of which 414 were confirmed negative and 2 positive.

Some 1,466 passengers and 95 staff arrived in the UK on direct flights from Wuhan between 10 and 24 January. Some 162 of the passengers have already left the UK, 53 of the crew have already left the UK and 1107 are now outside of the incubation period.

Public Health England is working to contact the remaining passengers.
