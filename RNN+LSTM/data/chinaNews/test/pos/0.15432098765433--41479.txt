President Donald Trump took a hilarious swipe at Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the historic USMCA trade deal signing - by handing out commemorative pens.

The president was met with laughter as he handed out pens from a box after signing the deal.

Trump was, of course, mocking Speaker Pelosi who gave Democrats gold souvenir pens to celebrate the signing of the resolution to transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate earlier this month.

Pelosi drew criticism for signing the documents with commemorative pens - with her name on them - which she then handed out to Democrats as souvenirs to mark the occasion.

Critics slammed Pelosi and other anti-Trump Democrats, saying the tone of the event seemed celebratory.

The move was a stark contrast from what the speaker had repeatedly said was a "somber" and "prayerful" act.

"You know what you hand out pens for? Accomplishments. Like, say, signing a historic trade deal with China," Elizabeth Harrington, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, tweeted back then in response to Pelosi's gesture.

"So it's fitting that Democrats are handing out pens for their sole accomplishment: impeachment.

"Democrats have done NOTHING for the American people."

Trump, who was celebrating one of his largest economic policy victories with the signing of the USMCA trade deal between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada -- he promised to renegotiate NAFTA during his campaign -- seemed to call back to Pelosi's controversial moment as he shoveled handfuls of pens at lookers-on Wednesday.

Handing out ceremonial pens is a common tradition among American elected officials.

When a president or other leader uses a pen to sign a historical document, it also becomes historical.

President Barack Obama, for example, used 22 pens to sign his signature piece of legislation, the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare.

The former president didn't catch heat for that celebratory act as the groundbreaking legislation he boosted became law, but Obama had not made it a point to wear dark colors for the "solemn" act of signing the ACA, as Pelosi did with impeachment.

"THIS is something you hand out pens for!" Harrington tweeted following Trump's USMCA signing ceremony.

The USMCA, which is the biggest trade deal of all-time, covers more than $1.3 trillion of commerce, and is the second major trade deal secured by the Trump administration this year.

The agreement has already been ratified by Mexico, but not yet by Canada.

"You're going to see more jobs all across the economy, in the automobile sector, in the agricultural sector and of course in the energy sector as well," Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette told FOX Business' Maria Bartiromo on Wednesday.
