A Scouse Chinese family brought in the new year this weekend at their popular Kensington chip shop.

Ken Huang and his wife Xiaomin Peng celebrated at the Wing Lee chip shop on Kensington when the big moment landed at midnight on Saturday, January 25.

The couple have run the chip shop outright for the last four years after taking it over from Ken's retiring parents, who themselves had owned the chip shop for 12 years.

The much-loved chippie has served the people of Kensington and surrounding areas for more than six decades and some of its customers have fond memories of it.

Today, its most popular dish is salt and pepper chicken and chips and almost every phone order involves these.

As it is Chinese New Year, we went down to L7 to speak to owner Ken to see why the chip shop is so loved, find more out about the chip shop's history and to say 'Gung hay fat choy!'.

Customers travel for miles

The chip shop, located at 71 Kensington, has had three different names while it has been open. Ken said that it was formerly known as Kensington Fish Bar and Tony's prior to that.

And in the six decades plus it has been open it has had three sets of Chinese owners.

Ken said the chip shop is an institution in Liverpool and he added: "It's been going as a chip shop for a long time and we love being here.

"We started running this chip shop in December 2003 and I started here when I was 18.

"Some of our customers have been coming here for over 50 years.

"A lot of locals come in to order food here and we get people in Childwall who order online and come and pick it up themselves. Lots of students order food here as we are not far from the universities.

"One customer lives an hour's drive away in the car and he comes here and goes to see his mum who lives in Kensington and takes his food back home to eat."

Ken's journey to Liverpool

Ken, 34, came to Liverpool with his mum and dad from a Chinese coastal town at the age of 13 and he went to Broadgreen school.

The dad-of-two said: "I come from Guangdong in China. It was a change in environment for my mum and dad and me when we came to Liverpool.

"My mum and dad enjoyed working here and they have made a lot of friends through the chip shop. We have a good rapport with the customers.

"Some of the customers have been coming in here since they were children and they remember when tripe was sold in the window."

Why some still call it Tony's

The chip shop - located not too far away from the house where The Quarrymen, whom later became The Beatles, recorded two songs in a recording session- has stood the test of time, having outlived three other chip shops that were located on the same high street.

Ken added: "Some remember when it was called Tony's chip shop. Some people still call it Tony's chippie.

"Tony was a nice guy and he went to retire in West Derby after working here for years. He sold the chip shop to someone else and it was called Kensington Fish Bar and it was called that for about three years.

"Then my mum and dad took it over and they called it Wing Lee. It is a lucky name."

Most popular dishes

"Most people like sweet and sour dishes from here, and especially in crispy food. We sell a lot of salt and pepper, too.

"In fact, almost every day with every order we sell a lot of salt and pepper chicken and salt and pepper chips.

"The second most popular dish is sweet and sour. People like the strong tastes and the spicy flavour.

"The third most popular food we sell is the beef curry. We sell a lot of Chinese chow mein.

"My dad was chef and he taught me how to cook a lot of the meals and I went away to see how other places did meals, too."

How the family will celebrate Chinese New Year

On the eve of Chinese New Year many Chinese families will sit down together to celebrate the new year and they have lots of food.

Ken said: "We have a dinner to celebrate. The older generation give red packets out with money inside and they give you luck. So you might get Â£20 but some people get more and some less.

"It's just lucky and it means best wishes to the receiver of the red packet. And the red colour of the packet means happy, lucky and good.

"We will say 'Gung hay fat choy!' which is how Cantonese speakers wish you a 'Happy New Year!'. It means 'wishing you great happiness and prosperity'."
