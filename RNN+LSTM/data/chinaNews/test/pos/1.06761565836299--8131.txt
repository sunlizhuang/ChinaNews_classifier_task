Two giant panda cubs that called Calgary home for nearly two years have landed in China.

The Calgary Zoo said Monday on social media that Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue had arrived safely at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.

“They will be deeply missed by our staff, volunteers, Calgary community and by people from across North America and around the world who visited them,” the zoo stated in a video tribute posted to Twitter.

The brother and sister cubs, born at the Toronto Zoo in October 2015, arrived in Calgary in March 2018 along with mother Er Shun and fellow adult panda Da Mao. The two older animals will return to China in 2023 following a 10-year stay in Canada.

The cubs’ stay in Calgary had been extended by a few months before departing to China as part of a loan agreement with Canada.

“Through their time in Calgary we worked with Toronto Zoo to ensure they received the best-specialized care,” the Calgary Zoo stated online.

“Our animal care team worked daily to refamiliarize the cubs with their crates to ensure their comfort on the journey to Chengdu, China. Dedicated members of their Calgary Zoo human family were with them throughout the flight.”

A new $14-million enclosure dubbed Panda Passage was built for the quartet, which has proved a massive draw for the Calgary Zoo.

Attempts to impregnate Er Shun through artificial insemination at the Calgary Zoo have yet to be successful, said zoo spokeswoman Alison Archambault.

“That can only be attempted once a year, so we can’t try it again until the spring,” she previously said.
