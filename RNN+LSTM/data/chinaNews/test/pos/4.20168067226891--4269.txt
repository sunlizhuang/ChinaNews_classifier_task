Racial harmony is part and parcel of living in a multicultural society like the one Malaysia has. Indeed, we are actually privileged enough to be living in a nation where we get to experience each other’s cultural customs, festivals, and indeed food (especially food) together. So despite the recent fiasco over one lawyer’s brash remarks about a Puchong school’s Chinese New Year decorations, it seems that it has brought more people together, as opposed to dividing Malaysians.

In a recent Facebook post uploaded by user Alice Jong Liz, he explains that as a Muslim, he himself also celebrates Chinese New Year and eagerly participates in the festivities. He goes on to add that:

“Schools that choose to celebrate Chinese New Year and put up lanterns are not at fault, as this will only benefit students by allowing them to know that this is part of Chinese New Year custom.”

He even goes a step further to explain what the Mandarin character 恭喜发财, or commonly known as Gong Xi Fa Chai means, saying that the much beloved greeting is used to wish other’s wealth and prosperity.

In fact, his Facebook also include numerous photos of him and his family participating in many Chinese New Year cultural traditions, such as having a family reunion dinner!

His show of racial harmony and tolerance has since gone viral over the Internet, with many Malaysians praising him for his willingness to respect and even participate in other cultural traditions without prejudice and hatred.

To Mr Jong Liz, we salute you for being a shining example of what a Malaysian should be, and hope that this sets a fine example for all of us reading this!
