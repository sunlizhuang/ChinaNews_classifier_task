KUALA LUMPUR, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- AirAsia announced Friday it has expanded its network with new direct flights to Chengdu, China from Penang, Malaysia.

The low-cost carrier said in a statement that the new three times weekly direct flights will commence on March 8.

AirAsia Malaysia Chief Executive Officer Riad Asmat said the Chengdu-Penang direct flight is the airline's first route from Penang to the Chinese mainland, adding that the group is confident the additional route will continue to boost visitor arrivals into Penang and vice versa.

"We are excited to announce our first new route of the new year, welcoming Visit Malaysia 2020 and in conjunction with Experience Penang 2020. Penang is one of our largest secondary hubs in Peninsular Malaysia, to which we have flown more than 2.4 million guests to the island last year," he added.
