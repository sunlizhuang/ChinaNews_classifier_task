While Deepak Garkhel has been elevated to Operations Director, APEC, Pratim Thakurta will be Operations Head in India & Kedar Padgaonkar will now lead Data Processing in India

Ipsos India has rejigged roles of its top team in Operations. Deepak Garkhel, Operations Head of Ipsos in India, has been elevated to Operations Director, Ipsos Asia Pacific Excluding China (APEC) Region. Pratim Thakurta, National Field Head, has been promoted to Operations Head of Ipsos in India. Kedar Padgaonkar, responsible for Scripting, will now spearhead Data Processing for Ipsos in India.

Amit Adarkar, CEO of Ipsos in India, who held the additional charge of APEC Operations Director has handed out the APEC Operations portfolio to Garkhel. “It was extremely important to synchronise operations in the region and to tie up the loose ends, at the same time leverage opportunities, which I did for most part in 2019 and now that things are on a smooth grid, Garkhel will be adept at taking it forward. I have my hands full with my India role,” said Adarkar.

“All these new roles in Operations, Field and Tab are further going to strengthen our position in the marketplace, ensuring our data quality sets highest benchmarks for clients, aiding them in decision making and competitiveness,” added Adarkar.

Deepak Garkhel

Garkhel will be overseeing Operations of 12 markets in the APEC Region (India, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, ANZ, Philippines, Taiwan and Japan). In Ipsos parlance, Operations includes Field, Quality Assurance and Budget & Planning.

He will report to Hamish Munro, Global CEO, Ipsos Interactive Services (IIS) and Operations and on the dotted line to Christophe Cambournac, CEO, Ipsos AMEA (Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa). Garkhel in his 30 years in market research has led field, operations and even international research, making him the ideal choice for the role. He has held senior leadership positions with Ipsos, Millward Brown, TNS, MarketProbe, Pathfinders & Gallup. He is a management grad from IILM.

Pratim Thakurta

Thakurta, on the other hand, apart from leading the National Field Operations will also oversee Quality Assurance, Budget and Planning for Ipsos in India, and report to Amit Adarkar, CEO, Ipsos in India. Thakurta has about 27 years of work experience straddling Ipsos, Nielsen, TNS, Gallup and Indica in different capacities, within India and other geographies.

Kedar Padgaonkar

Patgaonkar, with almost two decades in data processing is credited with driving new initiatives for iField (data capture via tablets, completely eliminating pen and paper form of data gathering), automation and dashboards, interfacing with other Ipsos markets in the region.

He reports to Raja Bunet, Executive Director, Mobile First & New Initiatives, Ipsos in India.
