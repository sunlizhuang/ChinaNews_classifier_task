On February 1, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a telephone call with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov at the latter's request.

Lavrov said, Russia fully recognized and highly appreciated the effective measures taken by China to combat the new coronavirus outbreak, and believed that the threat of the epidemic will soon be eliminated. Yesterday, President Putin sent a message of condolences to President Xi Jinping, saying that Russia fully supports China in fighting the epidemic, is willing to provide necessary medical material assistance, send a delegation of epidemic prevention experts to China, and carry out joint development of vaccines and disease resistance drugs, etc.

Wang Yi thanked President Putin for sending a message of condolences to President Xi Jinping, saying that this reflects the strong mutual trust between the heads of state of the two countries and the high level of comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era between China and Russia. The Chinese people are working together to unite as one in a serious struggle against the epidemic. We are fully capable and confident in overcoming the epidemic.

The Director-General of the World Health Organization highly valued the decisive and powerful measures taken by China and was full of confidence in China's victory over the epidemic. It is a good tradition between China and Russia that we offer mutual support when we need each other the most.
