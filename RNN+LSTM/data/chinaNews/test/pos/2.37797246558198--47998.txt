Are we giving our children the skills they need for the future they will face?

Education changed in the last decades of the 20th century. The focus turned to the practical fields, science and technology and business, and away from the woolly-headed humanities. With America leading the world in technology, students were told that well-paying jobs would be available in fields like physics (electronics), biology (genetics and health care), computer science (the internet), business and marketing, and in the allied health professions.

The humanities and most of the social sciences (except economics) were put on the back burner. These topics were all right for people who liked these sorts of things. But graduates in these fields shouldn’t expect to find well-paying jobs — if any jobs at all.

This approach launched a 50-year social experiment. What happens when society emphasizes technical education and treats the humanities as irrelevant?

The results are becoming clear. On the one hand, we’ve seen unparalleled technological advances. We walk around with personal computers in our pockets that are more powerful than what NASA had to land men on the moon. Technology has clearly improved our lives.

On the other hand, however, technology has also disrupted our lives. Computer technologies are raising concerns about our loss of privacy and the possibility of massive governmental control. China shows us the scary possibilities here: It has placed a half-billion closed-circuit cameras in public places. Along with improving facial recognition software, this has made it possible for the Chinese government to monitor the movement of all its citizens.

There have been other consequences closer to home. We seem to have lost our social skills. Our politics have become increasingly antagonistic. Communication breaks down as we demonize those who do not share our views. Increasing numbers of Republicans say that they do not want their children to marry Democrats — and vice versa.

Now, what do the humanities have to do with all this?

The humanities are traditionally the fields that have taught civic virtues like respect, courtesy and open-mindedness to differing points of view. They are also the subjects that help us think about the ethical aspects of new technologies, who benefits and who gets left behind in the endless march of technological progress.

It turns out that the humanities are pretty important after all. This isn’t only a point about higher education. Thinking about values and community should be rooted in the primary school experience: The basic features of children’s characters are built when they are young. If we wait until the high school years or college, it will be too late.

In response, some have called for the return of religion in the classroom. Religion is one traditional way for instilling a values education in children. And of course many parents choose to place their children in religious schools. But in a pluralistic culture such as ours, a values-based education needs to be found in other places as well. This is the role that the great traditions of literature and philosophy, music and art have played in the past.

This doesn’t mean instructing children in one or another political ideology. It is rather to place an emphasis on core values that nearly all of us share, of discipline, steadiness of purpose, self-confidence and respect for others.

Montessori education offers us an example of how this can work. Maria Montessori emphasized educating the whole child, not just in technical knowledge, but in the child’s full physical, social, emotional and cognitive well-being. The Montessori curriculum cultivates a lifelong love of learning while building a variety of skills, on cultivating self-esteem, competence, independence and responsibility. As Sima Cheregosha, head of ArborCreek Montessori in Farmers Branch, puts it, “Montessori sets the child up to succeed.”

Our public schools face challenges in bringing these elements into the curriculum. Recent decades have seen an increasing emphasis on teaching to the test in order to raise test scores. But this misunderstands the degree to which personal skills are the foundation for intellectual success. Children’s ability to acquire knowledge, process information and express themselves with clarity and power depends first on the development of the basic elements of character.

In more modern language, this is what those in educational circles call executive functioning. These skills give priority to planning, organization, time management and flexible thinking. In addition to the technical side of things, education needs to develop the child's sense of personal responsibility and mindfulness, to teach the child how to resist impulses, and to show steadfastness of purpose.

It’s time for a recalibration. Our schools need to find a new balance between the technical and the humanistic aspects of education.
