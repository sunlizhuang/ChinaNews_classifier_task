JOHANNESBURG - Medical staff from the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) have been deployed to ports of entry, as authorities continue to closely monitor the coronavirus.

The Health Ministry says there are no confirmed cases in this country, and there's still no recommendation to restrict travel or trade with China.

Meanwhile, the Chinese Ambassador to South Africa, Lin Song-Tian, says further study of the virus is required before a vaccine can be developed.

China has taken just 10 days to build a new thousand-bed hospital for those infected.

The death toll from the virus has now risen above three hundred and 61, with more cases being reported in other countries.
