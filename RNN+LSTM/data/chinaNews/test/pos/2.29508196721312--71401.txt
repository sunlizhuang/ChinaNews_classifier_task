Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday said the novel coronavirus outbreak cannot stop China from keeping its pace towards national rejuvenation. He made the remarks while meeting with the Vatican's Secretary for Relations with States Paul Gallagher on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.

The Chinese foreign minister said China is a country with 5,000 years of civilization and has undergone the test of violent storms and waves throughout history.

Referring to the critical moment of China's fight against the epidemic, Gallagher on behalf of Pope Francis and the Vatican's Secretary of State, conveyed the Holy See's respect and support to China.

China has the wisdom and courage to defeat the epidemic as soon as possible, he added.

Noting that the epidemic has begun to be brought under control, Wang told Gallagher that the virus is the common enemy of mankind and the international community should work together to deal with it. China believes that the Vatican side will play a constructive role in pushing the international community to support and cooperate with China's efforts to fight the epidemic in an objective, rational and scientific manner and jointly safeguard global health and security.

The two sides also highlighted the importance of the provisional agreement on the appointment of bishops signed in 2018.

This is the first meeting between the foreign ministers of China and the Vatican and Wang said the bilateral meeting is a continuation of the China-Vatican positive connection over time and will pave the way for further exchanges in the future.

China is willing to further enhance understanding and mutual trust with the Vatican side so that the momentum of positive interaction between the two sides can continue to develop, the Chinese foreign minister said.

"We both have experienced all kinds of storms and difficulties in history and no difficulties can't stop us from moving forward," the Chinese foreign minister said.

China has full confidence to win the battle against the epidemic, he added.

While fighting the epidemic, President Xi Jinping displayed outstanding leadership and the unity of the Chinese people impressed the world, Zarif said during the meeting.

The Iranian government and people will continue to provide all necessary support and help to China, he added.
