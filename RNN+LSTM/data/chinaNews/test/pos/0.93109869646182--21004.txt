Times were hard in the midwest in 1925, when Wayne Nies headed west with his family. His father was in search of opportunity, and the family went as far west as they could go. There was a little more opportunity in Port Angeles, Washington - but it was still pretty hard to get ahead.

In 1934, Nies decided that the United States Navy might just be the best opportunity in town - and he enlisted. He was 20 years old, and never doubted that it was one of the best decisions he ever made. Nies served his four years in the Navy, got out. looked around for something else to do… and then reenlisted. He was a Navy man, now.

There may not have ever been a person more suited to life in the Navy - and Nies loved everything about it. He was somewhat unclear about exactly what he was getting into, when he found himself on the gunboat Luzon, on the Yangtze River, in 1938. For a kid from Port Angeles, there couldn’t be a more exciting and interesting place to be. And it was about to get even more interesting.

The Luzon was stationed in the harbor at Shanghai, China, along with naval vessels from many of the world powers. They were all jockeying for position, in anticipation of a coming war. When that war broke out, the 210 foot Luzon was right in the middle of the fray. Anticipating the possibility of being trapped in Shanghai, the Luzon sailed to Manila Bay, and that’s where they were on Dec. 7, 1941. Avoiding immediate capture by the Japanese, the Luzon headed out to the small island of Corregidor.

There, along with hundreds of other U.S. and Philippine soldiers, the crew of the Luzon made their stand. After months of fighting with very limited weaponry and supplies, they were forced to surrender to the far larger and well-equipped Japanese forces. That was on May 5, 1942.

Nies was taken prisoner by the Japanese, and was interned for the next 1216 days.

Much later in his life, his daughter-in-law helped him put together a book that documents those years, and there is a copy of that book in the Coronado Library. It’s titled “1216 Lost Days”.

Three years in a Japanese prisoner of war camp would change anyone, but Nies seemed to come out of that a stronger, better person.

While recuperating in the hospital after the war, he met Irene, the woman who would be his wife for the next 50 years. They had a wonderful life together, many of those years spent in Coronado. Nies was well known around town, and his many friends knew that there was something special about him.

Those years as a prisoner of war helped him to see what is really important, and he lived his life, accordingly. Nies went on to serve a full 30 years in the Navy, and here’s how he was described in one of his many fitness reports:

“Mr. Nies is an exceptionally loyal officer, and a gentleman of the highest degree. He is calm, conscientious, and has an untiring optimism.”

His family would all agree with that.
