Susan Locklear traces her activities with Holocaust Museum Houston to some 30 years ago when her younger son came home from Deepwater Elementary School in Deer Park with questions about Nazi concentration camps.

The Dobie Ninth Grade Center teacher, who lives in Clear Lake, credits her love for learning, particularly history, to her father, the late Richard King of Deer Park.

However, her purple hair is Locklear’s own invention.

“It’s just for fun. The kids love it,” she said.

“It does spark interest,” added Locklear, a 1973 graduate of Deer Park High School, who teaches AP human geography to Dobie freshmen.

“I started dyeing my hair a couple of years ago at the beginning of each school year,” she said. “It’s pretty easy. I do it myself with a spray can from CVS.”

By the middle of the school year, “it fades to pink,” she said. “My hair is white; so it blends in.”

‘How we treat people who are different’

At the beginning of the 2019-2020 school year, Locklear introduced a new program to her students, “Engines of Change,” which is connected to Holocaust Museum Houston, where Locklear serves on the education committee.

“The curriculum uses the Holocaust as a background for the discussion of how we treat people who are different from ourselves,” she said.

The topics for the next four months will focus on social justice, civil discourse, human rights and the power of art.

One of the program’s most active students, Jacob Montez, will represent Dobie as an ambassador to a Jan. 27 conclave at the museum with other Houston-area high school students who will analyze social concerns that affect the city, state and world.

The 14-year-old son of Nathan and Alma Montez of Pasadena attended several events at the museum last fall, including a speaker event with Dolores Huerta, an activist who helped co-found the United Farm Workers with Cesar Chavez.

Locklear, who is single, said that her father instilled an attitude of achievement in her.

Fulfilling a dream to be a teacher

“Becoming a teacher was my childhood dream,” she said, but it wasn’t until her two sons left for college and she saw the opportunity after the company she worked for was sold. Locklear moved in with her parents and enrolled at Sam Houston State University.

In 2002, she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in secondary education with majors in history and English and a minor in geography.

This is Locklear’s 18th year with Pasadena ISD, where she has taught at three schools.

In 2011, she was named teacher of the year by the Texas State Historical Association.

As a member of World Affairs Council Houston and a travel fellow with the American Geographical Society, Locklear has become a global traveler, making trips to places including China and India.

“This is my fifth year teaching AP human geography,” she said, explaining that it’s the only subject for which a Texas high-school freshman can get a semester’s college credit by completing the course and scoring well on a college-board exam in May.

The course explores “how humans have understood, used and changed the surface of the Earth,” including patterns of human population, mitigation and land use, per a description at apstudents.collegeboard.org.
