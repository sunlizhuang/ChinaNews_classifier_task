Unlike those from the developed countries, the oldest airlines in Africa are only a few decades old. Despite this, many have grown significantly to attain recognition not only on the continent but all over the world. While international carriers still dominate the most profitable routes in Africa, local airlines have dominated the domestic market and are slowly taking up most operations connecting Africa to the rest of the world.

List of the best airlines in Africa

These are the most developed airlines on the continent:

1. Ethiopian Airlines

Ethiopian Airlines is, without a doubt one of the richest airlines, not just in Africa but also around the world.

The ultra-modern fleets assist the airline in serving passengers from 120 destinations across the globe.

Although there are talks on nationalizing the carrier, operating as an autonomous entity has enabled the carrier to compete with other airlines effectively.

Over the years, the airline has redefined professionalism in this industry. The passengers, for example, are certain about comfort, security, and unmatched customer care. Kenyan Airways is also one of the few airlines in Africa to have flexible booking procedures.

In 2019, the airline became part of the few airlines that have direct flights to the USA. According to pundits, direct flights to the USA were an important boost to the African aviation industry and more importantly, to the Kenyan carrier.

5. Royal Air Maroc

Royal Air Maroc (RAM) is one of the largest airlines in North Africa. A list of the best carriers in Africa is incomplete without mentioning RAM, which is owned entirely by the government of Morocco. Founded in 1957, RAM is also one of the oldest carriers in Africa.

6. Fastjet

Fastjet — a South African/British airline — is one of the best low-cost carries on this list. With less than a decade in operation, the carrier has redefined budget travelling in Africa. Prior to Fastjet, the budget travel options were inexistent. Fortunately, Fastjet has opened doors for other budget-friendly airlines in Africa.

Fastjet is in two main countries — South Africa and Zimbabwe. The company has, in the recent past, expanded to other markets such as Tanzania, Mozambique, and Zambia.

Although the airline has only six destinations, it is one of the most efficient airlines in Africa, based on different reasons. One of the key areas that makes Air Seychelles one of the best airlines in Africa is the carrier’s commitment to customer service. For example, the carrier is one of the few airlines in the world that allows passengers (in the economy class) to check in with a maximum of two suitcases (32 kilograms each).

Finally, Air Seychelles is a progressive airline, thanks to its attachment to Etihad. All the policies by this carrier are well thought and futuristic.

8. Arik Air Airlines

Even though the airline has faced some financial challenges, it has been able to readjust policies on time. In less than two decades, the airline is redefining air travel in Nigeria and the surrounding countries.

9. Mango Airlines

In most cases, government-owned airlines are expensive for passengers. Mango Airlines, a state-owned, carrier is, however, one of the most affordable airlines in Africa. South African Airlines is also one of the best entities as far as adapting to technology is concerned. The ticketing process, for example, is purely an online process and therefore one of the best in Africa.

In order to make the airline one of the most affordable airlines in Africa, it does not include drinks and food in the ticket prices. However, the airline has partners in the hospitality industry that give passengers these services. Outsourcing these services creates a win-win situation between the carrier and the passengers.

10. TAAG Angola Airlines

TAAG is the oldest airline in Africa. Founded in late 1938, TAAG Angola Airlines has not only redefined longevity in the air travel industry but it has also opened up Angola as one of the key trading and tourism destinations in Africa.
