Last year there were news reports that Rolex wanted to buy Patek. “I think I made it quite clear that I will not sell,” Mr. Stern said. “We should be proud of it when big companies want to buy Patek because that means we are doing something right. But we are not for sale.”

Instead, he said, he intends to be at the company for what he called “many years” before offering the keys to one of his two sons. The elder, at 18, is studying for the hospitality industry, but the younger, who is 16, has just started studying watchmaking and working part time at the factory.

“I didn’t have two children to take over Patek,” Mr. Stern said. “They have to make their own choice. We will always find somebody that will take care of Patek Philippe.”

Looking to the next decade, Mr. Stern said that he had no plans to expand into new territories and that he was not pushing hard in China, which his competitors have identified as critical to traditional watchmaking’s long-term success. According to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry, Swiss watch exports to mainland China rose 32.8 percent from 2016 to 2018. Patek opened its first branded showroom in Shanghai in 2005.

“I’m not afraid to stay behind,” Mr. Stern said. “We are already in 74 countries. I don’t have the capacity, and I would not destroy another market just to shift watches to China. But also, we go step by step. This is how we do our business. It’s worked in the whole world.”

He said the approach had protected Patek’s business when markets have declined. In December, for example, the federation reported that exports to Hong Kong, which it lists separately from mainland China, were down by 26.7 percent in November year over year, eroded by the city’s continued civil unrest and related economic recession.
