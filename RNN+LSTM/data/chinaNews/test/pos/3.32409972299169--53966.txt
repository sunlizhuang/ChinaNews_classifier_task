ESPN pundit Shaka Hislop has set Manchester United new boy Odion Ighalo a target of scoring six goals for his new club.

Nigeria forward Ighalo has signed on a six-month loan on transfer deadline day from Chinese Super League club Shanghai Shenhua, describing the transfer as a “dream come true”.

United only pushed through the shock transfer just before 11pm on deadline day, but Foot Mercato claim United made an approach to Ighalo before January and in fact the 30-year-old agreed to the deal on January 26.

United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in desperate need of forward options after the injury to Marcus Rashford and says Ighalo’s physical presence will make a difference for United.

When asked how many goals for Ighalo would need to score to mean he was a successful purchase, Hislop replied: “Let me see, how many games to go this season?

“If he gets six goals I think that’s a success. Just under half [per game].

“The thing is, the question becomes ‘Does he start?’ and ‘Where does he start?’.

“Rashford’s injury might suggest as much but give [Mason] Greenwood a shot.

“It makes no sense as much as trying to figure out how many games he’s going to start and where those goals are going to come from.

“Six is good, six is a good number.”

Ighalo has a career record of 136 goals in 348 games, including 39 goals in 99 games for Watford and with United having 13 Premier Leagye games remaining Hislop is looking for the player to score around a goal every two games.

Solskjaer has explained why he wanted Ighalo at the cliub, despite seeing two bids for Josh King and numerous other striker enquiries fall by the way side.

“He is a striker, has a physical presence and is a goalscorer so he will give us a lot,” Solskjaer said.

“You would be thrilled when you have been a Manchester United supporter your whole life and you’ve been working your whole life.

“Being the top scorer in the African Cup of Nations tells you a lot about the qualities we are going to get.”
