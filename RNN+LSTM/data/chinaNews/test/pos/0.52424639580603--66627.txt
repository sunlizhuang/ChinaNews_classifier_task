OnePlus typically treats its fans to two smartphone launches each year, spaced roughly six months apart. However, this year was believed to be no different with the Chinese firm rumoured to be hard at work on the OnePlus 8 series – its next range of handsets. If OnePlus followed its typical release window, the technology company had been expected to release the OnePlus 8 series in May – exactly when it unleashed the OnePlus 7 last year.

However, it seems OnePlus could hold its first smartphone launch well before that.

Teenage tipster Ishan Agarwal – that has an incredibly accurate record when it comes to smartphone leaks, particularly when it comes to OnePlus – recently claimed the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro could launch as early as “late March or April”.

Additionally, Agarwal said each will be available in a new green colour.

He tweeted: “Got some OnePlus news to share with you all! The OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro (Who knows, maybe the 8 lite too) will be launching sooner this time! Expect a launch in Late March or April. Also, there will be a new Green colour for both the phones.”
