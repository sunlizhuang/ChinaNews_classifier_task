The Chinook Indian Nation rallied Monday afternoon in advance of a court hearing that could determine whether the Pacific County-based tribe can reapply for official federal recognition.

Tribal members and supporters gathered in Tacoma to rally in advance of a 3 p.m. hearing in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.The hearing continued late into the afternoon and a report was not available before press time.

The hearing could determine whether the tribe can seek federal recognition after its recognition was revoked in 2001 by George W. Bush’s administration. Tribes who have applied for recognition have been denied the right to reapply.

In August 2017, the tribe sued the U.S. government in the Ninth Circuit of the U.S. District Court for its right to reapply as well as asking for funds guaranteed to the tribe in 1970 that have never been awarded.

That case is ongoing in the Western Washington U.S. District Court. On Nov. 26, the tribe asked Senior U.S. District Judge Ronald Bruce Leighton to rule on the case.

Federal recognition means the U.S. government acknowledges that tribes have sovereignty and rights to self government. It also entitles tribal members to receive certain federal benefits, services and protections.
