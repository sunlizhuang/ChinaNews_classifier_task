The Federal Government has said it is ready to tackle coronavirus in the event of its outbreak in Nigeria.

The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Farouq, said this during her visit to the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja to inspect facilities meant to detect the virus among incoming passengers at the airport.

She was accompanied on the visit by the Ministers of Aviation, Hadi Sirika; Minister of State for Health, Olurunnimbe Mamora; and Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, among other officials.

The World Health Organisation had declared Nigeria a high risk country, saying the country would likely experience coronavirus outbreak.

This is because Nigeria has strong trade links with China and about 50,000 Chinese work in Nigeria.

During the recent Chinese New Year holiday, about 8,000 Chinese travelled out of Nigeria to their country to celebrate the holiday.

But Farouq said technological tools and human resources had been deployed by relevant agencies at the airport and the National Centre for Decease Control’s laboratory at Gaduwa, Abuja.

She said, “The World Health Organisation has declared the ongoing coronavirus pandemic as Global Health Emergency due to the number of people and countries affected.

“Nigeria has responded to the pandemic challenge by mobilising all relevant government agencies to ensure our people are protected by putting in place measures for the prevention of the spread of the virus, early detection and if necessary managing cases detected in the country.

“The Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development’s mandate involves the protection of vulnerable citizens who are affected by disasters, including biological disasters like the coronavirus and Lassa fever.”

She added, “To prevent the outbreak of diseases, disaster and provide succour for the vulnerable population, the ministry is tasked with the coordination of responses by relevant government and non-governmental agencies in the country.

“This informed my visit today to see all the efforts that have been put in place by the relevant agencies against the coronavirus pandemic.”

In his comment, Mohammed said the FG had put together an inter-ministerial committee to ensure that Nigeria was ready to tackle any potential outbreak of the disease.

He said, “We are ready for the coronavirus; we have not recorded a confirmed case of the virus but we have the ability to handle the crisis in case it happens.”

Japan plans to treat coronavirus with HIV drugs

Japan plans to test HIV medications to treat patients infected with coronavirus as its growing number of cases poses an increasing threat to the economy and public health, the government’s top spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said on Tuesday.

Suga, who disclosed at a news conference, could not say how long it would take to approve a new drug.

He said the government was making “preparations so that clinical trials using HIV medication on the novel coronavirus can start as soon as possible.”

Japan had 520 confirmed infections by Monday, including 454 cases from the Diamond Princess Cruise ship quarantined off the port of Yokohama, the health ministry said, with one death from the virus.

On Tuesday, there were three more cases confirmed with the virus in Wakayama Prefecture, local media reported.

The HIV trials come as those drugs have been touted as potential cure for the coronavirus around the world.

With no therapy yet proven 100 per cent effective, the epidemic has killed close to 1,900 people in mainland China.

Gbajabiamila commends China

The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has commended the Chinese government for the measures taken to contain coronavirus and prevent its spread to other parts of the world.

The Speaker gave the commendation in Abuja on Tuesday when he received the Ambassador of China to Nigeria, Mr Zhou Pingjian, in his office, according a statement by his media office.

He said, “You’ve been proactive so far. You built a 1000-bed hospital in about a week and another 1600-bed hospital. We know that all these things are temporary but necessary measures. You did address the issue of misinformation and all of that. But we must always recognise the fact that there will always be fear of the unknown.

“We met with the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control here. The DG gave us the same assurances that you gave us. With the measures taken, I know in no time it will go. But whatever that caused it in the first place should be addressed. We’re here to support you so that you’ll continue to fight this disease.”

Gbajabiamila presented a letter of condolence to the Chinese ambassador for onward transmission to the Speaker of the Peoples Congress of China.

Pingjian had earlier told the Speaker that the Chinese government had taken enough measures to contain the disease. He said, so far, no Nigerian living in China had been infected with the disease, noting that his country would do everything possible to protect foreign nationals resident there.
