CHAMBISHI, Zambia, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian business community is supporting the introduction of Mandarin Chinese in Zambia as it will help the stakeholders to partner with the Chinese enterprises for improved trade, a local businessman said on Friday.

Martin Chanda, an entrepreneur in Kalulushi district on the Copperbelt province, said the business community is interested in learning Mandarin Chinese in order to ease communication with Chinese counterparts.

"Learning Mandarin will enable the business community to forge partnership as a result of easy communication between the two parties which may end up in joint business ventures," he said.

Speaking in an interview with Xinhua, Chanda said China is a fast growing economy in the world and partnering with Chinese is the only way to tap and learn their economic strategic long term planning.

He said the call by teachers in Chambishi to introduce Mandarin learning centers on the Copperbelt province is timely as it will benefit Zambians through employment by Chinese enterprises.

"Mandarin Chinese is slowly becoming an international language as most countries have universities which are now teaching the Chinese language, with African students competing in Mandarin speaking," he said.

And Melody Lungu a businesswoman in Kalulushi said the flow of Chinese investments in Chambishi Township has created jobs for the local people.

Lungu said Chinese have brought about new investments especially at Chambishi Multi Facility Economic Zone.

"With increased flow of Chinese investment there is need to learn Mandarin Chinese as a way of supporting new investment through easy communication," she said.

While, John Kaluba, a youth of Chambishi Township said most youths are interested in learning Mandarin Chinese for easy communication with Chinese employers.

Kaluba said there is need to embrace Chinese language if youths are to learn Chinese working culture that will improve their commitment to duty.

"Once youths are trained through Chinese work culture there will be improved participation in national development," he said. Enditem
