— Berlin zoo released a new video on Thursday showing panda twin cubs Meng Xiang and Meng Yuan playing indoors on what appears to be a wooden bench, decorated with a bamboo branch.

The zoo, where the furry animals were born in early September 2019, said the footage was filmed two days ago and that the twins now weigh 8.5 kg (18.7 pounds) and 8.8 kg respectively.

For now, mother Meng Meng and her offspring Meng Xiang and Meng Yuan will continue to spend time together behind the scenes, Berlin zoo said, adding that the twins' first public outing is scheduled for the end of January or beginning of February "once they can safely follow mom."

Pandas normally raise only one cub at a time, so the zoo is actively supporting Meng Meng, 6, in the rearing process and has enlisted experts from China's Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding Zoo to help.

China has long engaged in “panda diplomacy.” German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese President Xi Jinping welcomed Meng Meng and dad Jiao Qing to Berlin Zoo at a ceremony in 2017 as part of a loan agreement.

Under that deal, any cubs will be returned to China once they no longer need their mother.
