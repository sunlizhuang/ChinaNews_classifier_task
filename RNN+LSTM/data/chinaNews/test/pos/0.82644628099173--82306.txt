Local Chinese community raises money to help Wuhan hospitals amid coronavirus outbreak

INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) – Medical staff are in desperate need of supplies amid the coronavirus in China.

Cummins’ East Asian Employee Resource Group and the Columbus Chinese Association have raised more than $20,000 to help hospitals in Wuhan.

Many employees with Cummins are from China. Jingzhi Xiao told News 8 his father is recovering from the coronavirus in Wuhan. Xiao said he’s had many fevers and remains in the house.

“First when I heard it, I was heartbroken. I got the news the first day of the Chinese New Year,” Xiao said. “It’s hard for me because I’m away from home, so there’s not much I can do to help him, but to just tell him to stay strong.”

Cummins employees and members of the Columbus Chinese Association got some supplies on one of the last flights to China before many airlines stopped flights. Columbus Regional Hospital donated 10,000 masks to support the communities in China.

“Almost 3,000 masks were delivered to Beijing airport in about a day and a half and people in China, Cummins employees, also took the masks and distributed from Beijing to Wuhan,” said Lina Shi.

Cummins has been closely working with distributors to order supplies such as goggles, masks and bodysuits, but members said it’s been a challenge as the supplies are in high demand and have been out of stock. Employees said the supplies have to meet China’s medical regulation standards.

“You can find like 20 suits online, but actually only three of them really work and can be supplied to the front-line doctors,” said Xiao Geng. “It’s definitely a lot of work and a learning curve.”

“It’s a team effort and as a Cummins employee, caring is a core value, so everybody cares about the people there in Wuhan,” said Xiao.

Cummins and the Columbus Chinese Association are still accepting donations for the next batch of protective equipment. You can donated on PayPal to ccaboardmember@gmail.com and leave name and contact information in the memo, and note it is a donation to support Wuhan.
