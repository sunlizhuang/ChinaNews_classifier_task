Over 60 women , from Jenner to Camrose and everywhere in between, flooded the town of Byemoor on Wednesday, February 12th to take in the Ladies Calving Clinic hosted by Special Area No.2, Starland County and County of Stettler Agricultural Service Boards. This event marks the fifth year that Special Area No.2 has had a hand in hosting a unique ladies-only night aimed at providing skills to deliver calves on their ranches successfully. Speakers this year included veterinarians Dr. Tamara Quaschnick and Dr. Ben Schultz, as well as industry representatives Melissa Downing from Verified Beef Production Plus and Nicki Westersund of Neogen Canada.

Hanna’s own Dr. Quaschnick delivered a presentation about the risks and opportunities of using dairy nurse cows to rear beef calves, titled “An udder from another mother”. Along with an e-cow-nomic assessment of the value of a nurse cow, she stressed the importance of biosecurity of your beef herd when introducing an off-farm nurse cow or purchased calves.

Dr. Schultz of Maverick Large Animal Veterinary Services gave a very entertaining presentation on calving dystocia including his tips & tricks to quickly and safely deliver backwards, head back, feet back or large calves.

Melissa Downing let ladies know about the opportunity to earn an extra $18/head on their cattle that remain in a certified sustainable chain from farm to harvest. If you are interested more in this topic, or would like to get VBP+ trained, join Melissa in Spondin on February 25th for a workshop.

The Chinook Applied Research Association is hosting another Ladies Calving Clinic in Pollockville on March 5th. Dr. Quaschnick, along with Pollockville locals Dr. Kirby Finkbeiner and Dr. Colleen Christianson will be speaking on a large variety of calving related topics.
