"The president’s circle are realising that, at the very minimum, our playbook has not changed China's behaviour," said Evan Laksmana, a senior researcher at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta

"From a meeting I had with some of them last week, there is a sense they are trying to find more options," he said.

A sustained and focused diplomatic approach to the issue could be played out through ASEAN, where a long-running effort to agree on a code of conduct in the South China Sea could get traction this year under the chairmanship of Vietnam, which has also repeatedly protested Chinese fishing.

Or Indonesia could choose to initiate a dialogue with other middle ranked powers with security interests in the Indo-Pacific, namely Australia, India, South Korea and Japan.

Indonesia should now take a leading role to convince China to stop pushing claimant states and Indonesia towards Washington. — Imron Cotan, a former Indonesian Ambassador to both China and Australia.

On Friday, Japan stepped up after a meeting between its Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and Jokowi in Jakarta.

In addition to agreeing to assist in the development of a maritime affairs and fishing centre on the Natuna islands, Minister Motegi also indicated Japan was ready to become more involved in Indonesia's maritime development. In reference to the South China Sea, Minister Motegi said: "We shared a serious concern regarding efforts that tried to change the status quo unilaterally and we want to continue close collaboration."

While Japan's expression of support was welcome, many Indonesians believe China's aggressive pursuit of its claim to large tracts of the South China Sea mean the time has come to advance these types of discussions in a broader group.

"We can no longer sit and remain idle, watching as events unfold in this most contested zone," said Imron Cotan, a former Indonesian Ambassador to both China and Australia.

"Indonesia should now take a leading role to convince China to stop pushing claimant states and Indonesia towards Washington," he said.

Both Jakarta and Beijing have been at pains to distinguish between the maritime flare-up and the two countries' increasingly close economic ties.

On Wednesday, the Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia Xiao Qian said both countries had “wonderful relations” but “even good friends might have different views”.

“We can solve this problem through diplomatic channels as I believe it will not affect the economic and investment [relations] between China and Indonesia,” he said.

China is Indonesia's biggest trading partner and its second-biggest source of foreign investment. In the nine months from January to September last year, Chinese investors poured 46.3 trillion rupiah ($4.52 billion) into the country, second only to Singapore as a source of funds.

Jokowi has made increasing foreign investment a priority for his second term in government. It's needed to fund the ambitious Indonesia 4.0 economic development plan and to fund infrastructure, particularly as the state-owned enterprises that financed much of the big ticket projects in Jokowi's first term are now cash-strapped.

However some analysts say it would be an overstatement to say Indonesia is economically reliant on China and there are other national priorities at play that should not be discounted.

Indonesia'a view is that it does not have a territorial dispute with China in the Natuna waters. This is because Indonesia's sovereign waters, which extend 12 kilometres from its coastline, and its Economic Exclusion Zone, which extends 200 nautical miles, is determined through the United Nations Convention of Law of the Sea Convention, or UNCLOS.

Beijing's claim to historical fishing rights not only has no basis in law but it is also directly challenging UNCLOS, which is almost sacrosanct in Indonesia, according to Dr Greta Nabbs-Keller, a Research Fellow for south-east Asia and the Indo-Pacific at the University of Queensland's Centre for Policy Futures.

"Indonesia's recognition as an archipelagic state was codified under UNCLOS. It is almost sacred to them. Indonesia has everything to lose from any erosion of UNCLOS principles so there is an ideational element to this as well," Dr Nabbs-Keller said.
