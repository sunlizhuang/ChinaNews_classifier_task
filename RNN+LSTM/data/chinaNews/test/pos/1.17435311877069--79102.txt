Why are we so certain Huawei is gearing up to unwrap the P40 Pro next month? Well, that’s because the firm’s Consumer Business Group CEO Richard Yu confirmed as such to French media back in December. More specifically, Yu claimed the launch would take place in Paris towards the end of March.

That sounds pretty accurate, especially as the P30 Pro and P20 Pro were unveiled on March 26 and March 27 in 2019 and 2018 respectively. Both launches also took place in the French capital.

Although the internet has been flooded with leaks, rumours and renders of the P40 Pro ahead of its release, the newest piece of speculation is particularly interesting. According to a new listing from TENAA – a regulator for mobile technology in China – both the P40 and P40 Pro could boast 5G support.

The listing images were captured and posted on Twitter by renowned Huawei leaker RODENT950. The post is most interesting because it suggests both the P40 and P40 Pro may only come with 5G support, meaning there may not be 4G versions of either offered.
