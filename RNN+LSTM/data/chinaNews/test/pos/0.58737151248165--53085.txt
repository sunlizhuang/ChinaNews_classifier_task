NEW DELHI: At a time when the Indian passenger vehicle market is staring at a double-digit decline in sales, new entrants from China, South Korea and Europe have turned out to be the saving grace.The likes of Great Wall, Kia and MG Motor , which have taken up almost a third of the show arena at the Auto Expo which begins this week, are the ones along with the VW Group and PSA that are expected to drive future investment in India’s auto sector. These global players are expected to invest $4-5 billion in India in the next three-four years, even as several other that had set shop here in the past are struggling to fill up half their installed capacity.Great Wall, MG Motor, Kia, PSA and the VW Group are likely to bring in $3 billion. The additional investment is expected from companies such as Changan, Foton and FAW.More than 25 new products, largely SUVs and electric cars, are likely to hit the Indian roads over the coming three years from these companies.To be sure, in a declining automobile market in 2019, new entrants Kia and MG Motor sold more than 80,000 units in six months, and are still sitting on pending bookings of 50,000 units. Due to rising cost of ownership and an ongoing economic slowdown, sales in the Indian vehicle market in 2019 had returned to the 2016 levels. But the show of intent by these companies to invest big indicates the long-term potential of the Indian market.Skoda Auto’s chairman of board, Bernhard Maier, said the current slowdown in India was a temporary phase and the market would bounce back soon.“Given the low level of motorisation and huge investment on road infrastructure, we are confident that the growth will come back. The estimates are that the Indian market would touch 5-6 million units by the end of the decade and Skoda wants to participate in that,” Maier added.Skoda is a VW Group company.At a time when incumbents have been rationalising production amid sluggish demand, Chinese-owned MG Motor is studying options for an additional facility, after having added more shifts at its plant in Halol, Gujarat. “A decision on a second manufacturing unit will be finalised by April,” MG Motor India president Rajeev Chaba said.The company has so far invested around Rs 2,200 crore in the country and has plans to bring in another Rs 2,800 crore by 2025.China’s Great Wall is scheduled to invest $1 billion for its India entry, a senior executive in know of the plans said. Great Wall recently signed an agreement to purchase General Motors ’ manufacturing unit in Talegaon, Maharashtra. PMI Electro Mobility Solutions (PEMSPL), along with its Chinese partner Beiqi Foton, has plans to invest Rs 500 crore for setting up an electric bus manufacturing plant at Pune in the next two-three years.According to automotive consultancy firm JATO Dynamics, the Indian passenger vehicle market is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 4-5% through 2026. According to JATO-LMC forecast, the market size would grow from 2.9 million units in 2019 to 4.1 million by that time.JATO Dynamic India president Ravi Bhatia expects the newcomers to account for almost 15% of the market, or little over half a million units by 2026. “Since 2019 we have seen a fresh wave of new OEMs entering or announcing their entry plans for the Indian market. We expect to see some of these at the 2020 Auto Expo. This indicates the attractiveness of the Indian market and its growth potential. In some cases, like Chinese OEMs, this may be part of their global expansion thrust. This is good for the customer as he can get access to globally competitive products and value propositions,” added Bhatia.South Korean car maker Kia Motors has set a target of selling 300,000 vehicles annually in three years and is already considering an additional 1 lakh capacity.Manohar Bhat, the head of sales at Kia Motors India, told ET: “Sooner the better. It depends on how many models I have got and how it pans out.”
