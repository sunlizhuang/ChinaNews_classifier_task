CHINESE New Year is an annual celebration which symbolises new beginnings to bring in wealth, good fortune and health.

The family gathering on the eve is not complete without a hearty meal of authentic and traditional Chinese dishes.

In fact, families can still get-together to have festive dishes at Oriental Chinese Restaurant.

This year, the restaurant in Pullman Kuala Lumpur, Bangsar, has pulled out all the stops with its splendid gourmet Chinese delicacies.

Vivid Chinese art and warm lighting add to the ambience and complements the mouth-watering food.



Braised Abalone with Sea Cucumber.

The Salmon Fish Snow Pear Yee Sang makes for a perfect appetiser to get the dinner rolling.

The Braised Eight Treasure Soup with Shredded Fish Maw was an absolute delight on the palate as the thick broth had a generous portion of prawns and fish fillet.

Diced onions brought out flavour in the soup while the mushrooms gave it rich aroma.

The Steamed Pearl Tiger Grouper with Fried Choy Po had light soy sauce to preserve its freshness, while spring onions and coriander enriched the overall flavour, resulting in tender and succulent fish that fell apart at the touch of a fork.

Stealing the show was the Braised Abalone with Sea Cucumber and Fish Maw served with broccoli.

The abalone and fish were stewed slowly with soy sauce, resulting in a perfectly cooked texture, complemented by the briny flavour of the sea cucumber.



Fried Glutinous Rice with BBQ Chicken and Mushroom.

The Wok-fried Live Tiger Prawn with Honey Sauce is a must-try. These big prawns are fried with honey and a great accompaniment with rice or eaten on its own.

Coming in cute, small packages were the Fried Glutinous Rice with BBQ Chicken and Mushroom wrapped in lotus leaf.

For dessert, the deep-fried nian gao with the palm sugar lent the crispy cake balanced sweetness.

The three menus are available until Feb 8 comprising the Gold Prosperity (RM1,499 nett), Platinum Prosperity (RM1,888 nett) and Diamond Prosperity (RM2,020 nett) for 10 diners per table.
