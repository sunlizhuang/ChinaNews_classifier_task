On January 26, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a telephone call with Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi at the latter's request.

Toshimitsu Motegi said, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, the Chinese government and people have taken positive and powerful measures to resolutely control the spread of the new coronavirus epidemic, and Japan pays tribute to this. A friend in need is a friend indeed. The Japanese side is willing to work with China to deal with the threat of the epidemic and provide China with all-round support and assistance.

Wang Yi gave a briefing on the prevention and control of the epidemic by the Chinese side. He said, the Chinese government attaches great importance to the epidemic. President Xi Jinping has repeatedly given important instructions on prevention and control work, and personally held a meeting on the first day of the lunar New Year for redeployment and remobilization. We have built an all-round and multi-level prevention and control system focusing on Wuhan and Hubei, from the central government to the local level. All aspects of work are open and transparent, and we are speeding up progress in a scientific and orderly manner. The Chinese nation has gone through great winds and waves and overcome countless difficulties. We believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese Government, the people of the whole country will unite as one, and be fully capable and confident to win this battle of epidemic prevention and control at an early date.

Wang Yi said, fighting the spread of the epidemic is a common concern of the international community. China is willing to work with other countries in the world, including Japan, to respond to the epidemic actively. We have informed the World Health Organization, relevant countries and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan of the latest epidemic situation, and have shared information on virus gene sequences with all parties at the first time. WHO expert group has arrived for the field visit in Wuhan, and highly praised the effective measures taken by China to deal with the epidemic. The Director-General of WHO also fully affirmed it. We thank the international community, including Japan, for its full understanding and support for China.

Wang Yi said, life comes first. The Chinese Government is committed to safeguarding the safety and health of the Chinese people. We will, in a responsible manner, safeguard the safety of every foreign national in China, including the Japanese expatriates, and address their legitimate concerns in a timely manner. We will continue to strengthen communication and coordination with the international community and work hand in hand for epidemic prevention and control.

Toshimitsu Motegi expressed appreciation for the efforts made by the Chinese side, and believed that China will certainly be able to eliminate the epidemic at an early date.
