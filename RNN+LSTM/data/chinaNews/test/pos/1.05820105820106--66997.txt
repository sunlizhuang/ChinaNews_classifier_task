Swedish skincare brand, Foreo, with Asian headquarters in Shanghai, is providing assistance to Chinese medical staff as they battle to contain the outbreak of novel coronavirus.

Foreo said it is ‘distraught over the stories from Wuhan City and the Hubei province’ and is donating 2,500 protective suits, totalling RMB100,000 (US$14,300), to three Chinese hospitals; Hubei Yangxin County People’s Hospital, Huanggang City Xishui County People’s Hospital and Huanggang City Yingshan County People’s Hospital.

“Doctors and nurses are lacking the necessary protective gear to combat it efficiently,” said Foreo of the virus.

“Foreo has worked through a multi-channel search and procurement to provide substantive assistance to the medical staff, and the first batch of protective clothing has been rushed from Europe to the three hospitals,” said the company in a statement.

“At this moment in time, the Foreo family is praying for the wellbeing and health for all those affected by the coronavirus outbreak.

“We are certain that with a united front and compassion for one another, the people of China will emerge stronger than ever.”

As reported, Foreo has renewed its commitment to the Travel Retail Awards, to take place in Singapore on 12 May, with confirmation it will be Platinum Sponsor for a second successive year.
