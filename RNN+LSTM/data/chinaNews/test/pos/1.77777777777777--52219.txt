CANTON – A St. Lawrence University student who was found dead in her room Saturday morning is being remembered fondly by classmates.

Margaret "Maggie" Blackmon, Class of 2021 from Poulsbo, Washington, a member of the equestrian team, “not only touched the lives of the St. Lawrence University community, but lives of members of the Canton community as well,” one message from a student said.

She “brought energy and insight to every class session,” “always with a smile and eager attitude,” others said. She was “one of the most kind and generous people I’ve known,” and was “a friend who loved deeply and fiercely,” others said.

The campus community was informed Saturday in a message from William Fox, university president. He said campus resources including those through the Dean of Student Life's office and Counseling Services would be available to students who might be helped by them, as well as Reachout of St. Lawrence County, a free, confidential, non-judgmental crisis and information hotline serving residents of St. Lawrence County.

“Later in this academic term, we will plan a gathering to honor Maggie's memory,” Pres. Fox said.

She was an anthropology major and three-year member of the Saints Riding Team.

There was no cause of death reported. Funeral arrangements have yet to be announced.
