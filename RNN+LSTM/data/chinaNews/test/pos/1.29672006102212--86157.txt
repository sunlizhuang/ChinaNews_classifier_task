2019 Review: Detailed Biopower Market Global Scenario and Development Activity

Bio power refers to electricity generated from the burning of biomass. Biomass can be readily available plant and animal matter. Locally grown energy supplies that include everything from cotton stalks, hay, wheat straw, switch grass, peanut hulls, wood chips, bark, logging residue, swine waste and poultry litter as a fuel source for bio power. Bio power is the largest source of non-hydro renewable energy in the world and as of May 2005 there was over 7,800 megawatts of biomass power capacity in 350 locations in the United States, according to U.S. Department of Energy’s office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). Today’s operating capacity generates approximately 44 billion kilowatt-hours per year, an amount equivalent to the electricity used by 4.5 million average U. S. homes.

In the United States, the regulations that control the release of oxides of sulfur (SOx) and nitrogen (NOx) are rapidly tightening under a variety of cap and trading schemes now being proposed for pollutants, particularly for NOx. These regulations may work as a potential boon to biopower because biopower technologies such as cofiring improve utilities’ emissions profiles in SOx and NOx and The Biopower Program is currently collaborating with environmental regulatory bodies such as the EPA to reduce regulatory uncertainty related to NSR and emissions. This is a critical issue because there are more than 200 companies outside the wood products and food industries that generate biopower in the United States.
