4x NYT Bestselling Author Wahida Clark I endeavor to use to use my platform to raise awareness for the important themes of family reorientation, conflict resolution and financial literacy in our communities.

On the heels of releasing her 16th book, "Thugs: Seven," publisher, author and motivational speaker Wahida Clark—who went from prisoner to 4-time New York Times bestselling author—will now be taking her fans on a raw and riveting journey in an upcoming docu-series, “The Queen of Street Lit,” a moniker she proudly wears for having initiated the Thug Love Fiction sub-genre. Directed by Antonio T.D. Faison, the project is currently in production, shooting in and around Atlanta, Georgia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Miami, New York and Ghana.

The series delves into the rich and complex story of Clark from her troubled youth to her lofty status atop the Street Lit genre. With some notable celebrity appearances, the project also spotlights the Thug Love Fiction genre and its effects on Hip-hop and urban culture.

Clark says, “By reading our under-celebrated Street Lit and Thug Love Fiction genres, we can heal. We promote literacy and address mental illness in our households through storytelling. I endeavor to use to use my platform to raise awareness for the important themes of family reorientation, conflict resolution, and financial literacy in our communities.”

Clark’s fascinating journey includes serving nearly a decade in federal prison—with one-time prison mate and media mogul Martha Stewart—to owning the most prestigious and fastest growing urban independent publishing house Wahida Clark Presents Publishing, which empowers other incarcerated authors to write and get published so they can support their families.

Clark’s publishing banner, is proud to debut her 16th novel, “Thugs: Seven”(December, 2019), the seventh installment in one of her three popular series, The Thug Series.

No stranger to adversity, Clark was a runaway and high school drop-out at 14 years old, and eventually, facing 10 years in prison, she decided to turn obstacles into opportunity.

While in prison, Clark herself took a creative writing course, wrote her first novel, landed a literary agent and book deals with major publishing houses, including Kensington, Hachette and Simon and Schuster—so she could support her two daughters back home. Her literary career catapulted her from behind bars into a 4-time New York Times Bestselling author, and that first book launched just one of her three renowned series.

Clark is also the vice president and business development officer of the 501c3 non-profit Prodigal Sons and Daughters, which offers proven rehabilitation for at-risk youth, as well as those aging out of the foster care system, in Georgia and New Jersey. The organization has partnerships with the Atlanta Braves, Falcons and Hawks through contracts with Delaware North and Levy Restaurants.

Drexel University professor Vanessa Irvin Morris says, “Wahida Clark is the creator of the Thug Love Fiction genre which is a sub-genre of street lit. She is also the first street lit author to pen a series, thus establishing the trend. Wahida’s style of writing has become the template for urban literature. When you read her novels, they are so real you are convinced that you either know the characters; you want to know the characters; or you are one of the characters!”
