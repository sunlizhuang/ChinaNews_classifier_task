TikTok seems to be everywhere right now.

The app, which allows users to share audio and pair it with different videos, has become a place where memes start and grow, and one politician is even betting it can get elected to congress. With the announcement of its LA office, the company shows that it's planning on sticking around.

It was the second-most downloaded app in the Apple App Store and Google Play store in 2019, surpassed only by Facebook-owned WhatsApp. It has 1.65 billion downloads to date, according to SensorTower.
