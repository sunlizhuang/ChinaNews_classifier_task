MANILA:PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte has expressed hope for stronger bonds between the Philippines and China.

Joining in the recent Chinese New Year celebration in the country, he highlighted the close cooperation between Manila and Beijing in his CNY message.

Duterte has pursued friendlier ties with China amid certain unresolved disputes over the South China (West Philippine) Sea.

‘May we foster even stronger bonds of friendship with those of Chinese descent all around the world through cooperation, investments, cultural exchanges and people-to-people ties.

‘The fact that we are celebrating this event and embracing it as one of our own reflects the strong and inseparable bond that has been forged through centuries of friendly and beneficial relations between the Philippines and China,’ he said.

According to the Manila Times, Duterte said the Chinese-Filipino community would continue to hold events that uplift the lives of the people, especially the marginalised and powerless.

He said small acts of kindness could create a ripple effect that would benefit many and create a huge wave of compassion for the greater good of the country.

The president had earlier declared the Chinese New Year celebration in the country on Saturday as a non-working day.

Duterte has opted to downplay the Philippines’ maritime dispute with China in pursuit of improved economic ties with the world’s second-largest economy.

Despite his government’s rapprochement with China, he said he would never surrender the country’s claims to the South China Sea and would bring up at the appropriate time Manila’s arbitration victory against Beijing.

Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar called on Filipinos and Chinese to ‘act humbly and wisely’.

‘Gong Xi Fa Cai (Happy Chinese New Year).We are one with the Filipino-Chinese community and everyone, in celebrating the Lunar New Year 2020. This year of the metal rat means the beginning of a new cycle,’ Andanar said on Saturday.

For the Chinese, this year is the year of the rat, the first animal of the Chinese zodiac that symbolises a fresh start and wealth.

Andanar said the rat was a sign of ‘prosperity’ based on the Chinese zodiac.

He hoped everyone would enjoy a ‘prosperous, safe and healthy 2020’.
