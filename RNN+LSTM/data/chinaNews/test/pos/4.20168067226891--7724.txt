Delta Air Lines today announced the official opening of its flagship store on Fliggy, a leading online travel service platform in China. In the new flagship store, Delta provides customers with seamless airline retailing experience and attractive promotions such as the special price tickets for the upcoming Chinese New Year, with discounts to be applied to all of Delta’s six daily nonstop flights between China and the U.S. – from Shanghai to Atlanta, Detroit, Seattle and Los Angeles, and from Beijing to Detroit and Seattle.

“Delta is committed to becoming the carrier of choice in the China-U.S. network, providing best-in-class products and services from pre-departure to arrival,” said Wong Hong, Delta Air Lines President for Greater China and Singapore. “China is a leading e-commerce market. The online flight ticket booking revenue is expected to skyrocket to near $127 billion by 2022 according to market research*. As a premier provider of online travel services, Fliggy will allow us to more effectively engage and serve our customers across China.”

Delta becomes the first U.S. airline to launch a flagship store on Fliggy. The store provides Chinese customers with a seamless airline retailing experience empowered by the industry leading NDC connection, distributing Delta’s rich content to the store, including picture, video, detailed product information, and much more, as well Alipay, ensuring a smooth payment process. Moreover, the online customer service provides real-time assistance with the experience just like shopping on Taobao.com.

Since the soft opening in July, the Delta Fliggy flagship store has seen surging demand, with daily bookings tripling on a quarterly basis. On the “Double Eleven” shopping carnival day, the flagship store set new records for both bookings and revenues.

“We are pleased to have Delta, the world’s leading airline, join us on Fliggy flagship store,” said Li Chen, General Manager of Transportation Unit, Fliggy. “We share the same goals of creating innovative and seamless experience to the Chinese customers. With the successful opening of the Delta flagship store, we are in the good position to serve these customers flying between China and the U.S., both online and offline.”

In April 2015, Delta became the first U.S. airline to accept Alipay payment options on its official website. Over the past several years, Delta has led the airline industry in transforming the customer experience. Delta’s digital transformation has introduced the first end-to-end biometric terminal in the U.S. at Atlanta‘s international airport; real-time RFID bag tracking and automatic check-in via the Fly Delta mobile app; an alliance that will empower customers with seamless in-cabin connectivity experience; more efficient and high-tech automated screening lanes; and a groundbreaking app that helps Delta pilots avoid turbulence for a more comfortable flight.
