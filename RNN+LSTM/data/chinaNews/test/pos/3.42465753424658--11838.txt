The construction work of Sri Lankaâ€“China Friendship Kidney Hospital in Polonnaruwa will be completed by July. The hospital is to be constructed at a cost of Rs. 12 billion, a Health Ministry spokesman said.

A Chinese delegation visited Sri Lanka from January 10 to 14 to check on the progress of health development projects implemented in Sri Lanka with Chinese aid, the spokesman said.

Earlier, medical equipment for the Ragama Teaching Hospital and other equipment required for medical students were provided with Chinese aid. MRI machines have been provided for the Ragama Hospital. Eight mobile vehicles will be provided this month for kidney treatment, he said.

The OPD building of the NHSL is also being constructed under the same programme. The 11-member Chinese delegation included Zhang Maoyu, Yang Zuoyuan, Cai Fangcai, Sun Xinliang and Zeng Huacheng, he added.
