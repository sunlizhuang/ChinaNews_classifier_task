Army chief General MM Narawane

In a major breakthrough for communication between Indian and Chinese armies, a hotline will soon be set up at the highest level as the long due mechanism to discuss border issues that was stuck for many years has found consensus.

Army Chief General MM Narawane said on Saturday that the "hotline is on the cards" finally between the Directorate of General of Military Operations and China's Western Theatre Command that is responsible for the Indian front.

The setting up of a hotline was delayed as there was no consensus on what level the communication mechanism must exist. Should it at be the Army HQ level or the command level was the big question.

"There were some differences that have been overcome," the Army Chief said.

Since China follows a theatre command system where one command is exclusively meant for the Indian front it has been decided to have it as the DGMO level from India and China's Western Theatre Command.

"We have had number of rounds of talks. Hope there is some forward movement," General Narawane said answering a question on the possibility of a permanent border resolution with China.

Talking of the army's role in finding a resolution, he said, "Armies by ensuring peace assist in process of talks. Recent visit of Northern Army Commander to China took place in cordial manner. Bonhomie and courtesy extended was professional and it augurs well for the future," he said.

Lt Gen Ranvir Singh, Northern Army Commander led a delegation to China recently.

Lt Gen Singh interacted with Gen Han Weiguo Commander PLA Ground Force and exchanged views on measures to further enhance peace and tranquility along the borders, the Indian Army said.

The visit comes days after Army Chief General MM Narawane after taking over from Gen Bipin Rawat said India is hopeful of a permanent settlement on border disputes with China.

The Indian delegation also visited the Western Theatre Command and met with General Zhao Zongqi, Commaader Western Theatre Command in Chengdu, responsible for front with India.

General Naravane said he will get a debriefing on the delineations from the Northern Army Commander soon after their return.

Gen Narvane also spoke about balancing out the requirements to cater both to China and Pakistan fronts. He said for dealing with China more capacity building is required, better roads storage for ammunition and moving of advanced weapon systems is a must.

Soon after taking over as Chief General Naravane had said that he is hopeful of a permanent resolution on border issues with China. He has at the same time maintained that India needs to pay more attention to the China front.
