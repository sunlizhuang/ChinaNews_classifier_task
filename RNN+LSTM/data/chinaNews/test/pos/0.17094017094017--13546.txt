It's been a wild year for Canton resident Don Ferguson.

The co-CEO and co-founder of Teeq Tequila debuted his line of tequila product in late 2018. After growing slowly across Michigan and plenty of exposure, Ferguson's line of tequila is on the move to warmer and sunnier climates.

The Canton-based tequila company ran by Ferguson and his wife, Nayana, and launched with co-founder Michael Rowoldt, will grow uts tequila empire by two more states beginning next month: Florida and California. Those two locations, Ferguson said, were targeted because of their high intake of the agave-based spirit.

Having less logistical challenges in those states also helped as well, Ferguson said.

"We wanted to pick two states that were easily accessible to us," he said. "Under our importation, we have access to those states immediately. We can directly import to a warehouse in California and in Florida."

Tequila lovers in those two states can begin to find the beverage on store shelves and on restaurant bars beginning in February.

In addition to the two styles of tequila launched by Teeq at the beginning — coconut lime blanco and reposado — a third has been added to the line: a more traditional blanco, which works well with mixing for cocktails such as margaritas but can also be drank on its own. That line was added in October.

"It's the purest form of tequila," Ferguson said. "It doesn't have that bite. It's really smooth so it can be sipped on ice."

The line has grown from 100 locations last year to more than 375 across Michigan now. It can be found at restaurants and shops across metro Detroit as well as the areas around Lansing, Livingston County, Grand Rapids, Port Huron and Battle Creek.

The growth began to truly grow, Ferguson said, after Hometown Life published a story on the tequila company in Jan. 2019. That story still gets mentioned to him when he's out in western Wayne County, and he takes a copy with him when he goes to tastings in communities such as Livonia and Canton.

"It really did start with that article," he said. "I put it up and people read it, and say 'Wow, you're in Canton.'"

In the new states, tequila drinkers will be able to find Teeq Tequila in markets such as Tampa and Miami in Florida, and in San Diego and San Francisco in California, with hopes to expand across those states.

Being in the San Francisco market in the coming months is key, Ferguson said, as the company plans to enter in the San Francisco World Spirits Competition in March, a prestigious competition that could boost the spirit company's profile if they do well enough.

"If we win, I want people to be able to buy it," Ferguson said.

He said he hopes to grow more, including other parts of the country. He said he's currently in negotiations to expand to three more states in the future.

The growth has been something not even Ferguson expected when the company began in 2018. He's looking forward to everything that's planned for the company in 2020.

"It's been pretty aggressive," he said. "If you would have told me we're getting ready to expand to California, Florida ... all these different things, I wouldn't have believed it."
