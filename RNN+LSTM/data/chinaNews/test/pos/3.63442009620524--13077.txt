We may be seeing more vegan options on menus and supermarkets than ever before, but the vegan lifestyle extends to more than what's on our plates.

The demand for vegan beauty has never been higher, leading to a welcome burst of fresh new makeup brands offering high performing products that perform just as well as their traditional predecessors.

But with everyone from established brands to fresh-faced newcomers trying to win the hearts and pounds of customers with their green credentials, how can you tell what's truly vegan and what's not?

What’s the difference between cruelty-free and animal-free?

Natural, ethical, sustainable, organic: it can be hard to cut through the marketing noise and find out which products are truly vegan.

PETA offers a helpful definition: “Cruelty-free” means that products were created without cruel, archaic testing on animals. Vegan products are defined as being cruelty-free as well as free of animal-derived ingredients.”

So that means beauty that contains none of the following on its ingredients list: beeswax, gelatine, lanolin, collagen, silk, dairy or honey. To cut to the quick, if it came from an animal - it's not vegan.

How can you tell if a brand is ethical?

The best way is to read the About Me section online, look out for Vegan trademark sign from the Vegan Society. Steer clear of products made in China as animal testing is required by law there.

MUA

MUA has always been committed to bringing the masses cruelty-free beauty but it recently updated its entire collection to ensure it's 100 per cent vegan too, coming good on a pledge it made to its customers in January 2019.

The brand ensured all new product launches over the last 12 months flew the flag for vegan beauty as well as working to reformulate the existing ranges to make them completely animal-friendly. MUA collected the data they found along the way to release its first ever Vegan Beauty Report, which also reveals that 68 per cent of people wouldn't know if an ingredient was vegan unless they looked it up. It's commendable that while we're all still grappling with veganism and trying to make better choices, this makeup brand has taken the confusion out by making its collection all-vegan.

It doesn' hurt that the products are tantalisingly cheap either. MUA is the place to go to for quick thrills - prices rarely nudge beyond a tenner, even for the incredible 20-shade eyeshadow palettes - making it perfect for trying the latest trends without breaking the bank.

Kat Von D – now KvD Vegan Beauty​

Formerly owned by the celebrity tattoo and makeup artist Kat Von D, the brand has changed hands to Kendo, the same producer who makes Fenty and Marc Jacobs Beauty.

Built on 12 years of offering 100 per cent vegan makeup that challenged modern beauty ideals, the new owners are changing the name to KvD Vegan Beauty but the current collection will remain on shelves and the brand will continue to specialise in vegan-only products.

Wrapped in black or Gothic packaging, KvD Vegan Beauty has all you need to create everything from a high-fashion look to off-duty makeup for the weekend.

Lime Crime

A favourite with makeup artists of every level, Lime Crime shouts about its vegan credentials about as loudly as some of the colours in its eyeshadow palette. Not that we're complaining, because the beauty offering is sensational.

Sold in the UK on Cult Beauty, Boots and Lookfantastic, there's everything from wet-look lip glosses to semi-permanent hair dye to lust over, all 100 per cent vegan and cruelty-free.

DearDahlia

So often, the word vegan conjures a budget look or cut-rate alternatives. Not so with DearDahlia, where everything from the packaging and the richly-pigmented formulas say luxe with confidence.

While the packaging might look familiar to a certain BadGal’s collection, all DearDahlia’s cosmetics are completely vegan - no compromises.

Our star pick? The dual palettes which come with a mirror, two eyeshadows and a multi-balm to swipe across cheeks, eyes and lips as you wish.

Cover FX

Radiant glowy makeup that’s vegan too? Just a click away at Cover FX, whose dazzling Custom Enhancer Drops are legendary. Available in no less than seven shades, use the integrated pipet to mix a few – and we really mean only a few because each packs a blinding gleam of light – drops into your foundation for an all-over glow or sparingly pat along the top of cheekbones for instant highlight.

There’s also foundation, concealer and blush to add to your beauty kit as well as setting sprays to help your freshly crafted look last from dawn to dusk.

As well as fully vegan and cruelty-free, the brand has a long-standing commitment to ‘clean’ ingredients so you won’t find talc, parabens, scent, mineral oil, gluten, sulphates or phthalates in any of their products either. Pretty fantastic.

From across the Atlantic comes this vegan beauty heavyweight, another wildly popular name on everyone's lips in the beauty community. Despite its name, the brand steers clear of animal by-products in its ingredients list, opting instead for vegan alternatives that are also chemical-free.

Cult Candy Cosmetics

As well as making moves to become more ethical, beauty brands are becoming more inclusive too, acknowledging that men as well as women like to experiment with makeup. A nominee in the ASOS Beauty Awards, Cult Candy Cosmetics is built around the core belief that makeup is for everyone, whether they identify as him, her or non-binary.

But be warned: it's not one for shy, retiring types. Palettes feature the sort of day-glo hues DC Comics’ Harley Quinn would kill for, but don't let that scare you off. There are a few more sober options for those who want to dabble in colour too.

We’ve got our eye on this bubble-gum pink liquid lipstick which dries matte – the perfect colour to cheer up a grey day.

Florence by Mills

Full of gentle, softly enhancing colours at a budget-friendly price (from £10 - £34), this may have started off as beauty for Gen Z-ers, but it appeals to customers across the board thanks to the highly wearable palette of cheek and lip colours.

It comes from 15 year-old Netflix Originals star Millie Bobby Brown, whose supernatural girl-next-door look has won fans across the world. Launched in September 2019, Florence is not only a committed vegan brand, but it’s also suitable for all skin types, dermatologically tested, infused with vitamins and botanicals, and free from irritants such as parabens, sulphates and synthetic fragrances.

If you’re not sure what to try first, we recommend the Cheek Me Later Cream Blush (available in six colours) which can be used sparingly on cheeks and dabbed onto lips for a fresh, rosy glow.

When vegan beauty looks this good, the concept of anything else is a Stranger Thing (not at all sorry).

Code Beautiful

Back when it launched in 2014, Code Beautiful was one of a handful of beauty brands who could confidently say they were 100 per cent vegan.

While it’s a busier marketplace now, they’re continuing to up their game with innovative new products like CODE FFL, a pre-mascara plumper that fattens and lengthens lashes to new levels. Granted, Code Beautiful doesn’t have a huge makeup offering but that means all the more care has gone into creating the hero products you’ll find in its online store.
