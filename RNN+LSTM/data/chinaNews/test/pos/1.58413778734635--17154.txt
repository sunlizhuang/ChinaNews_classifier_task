Buckingham Palace announced on Saturday that Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle would no longer be working members of the British royal family, and would no longer use their “Royal Highness” titles. Harry and Meghan had earlier said they would step back as senior members of the royal family, spend more time in North America, and “work to become financially independent”.

Like Harry and Meghan, royals in other parts of Europe too, have had trouble confining themselves solely to traditional duties, and have tried to pursue professional careers.

King Willem-Alexander is an avid pilot. In 2017, the monarch revealed that he had served as First Officer on KLM flights for 21 years, even after taking over the throne from his mother Beatrix in 2013, all the while balancing royal duties.

His wife Maxima has served as the United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development since 2009.

Princess Cristina, sixth in line to the throne and one of King Felipe VI’s older siblings, chose to work in the private sector, taking up jobs at the Caixa Bank Foundation and the Aga Khan Trust.

Cristina and her husband Iñaki Urdangarin were embroiled in controversy in 2016 after Urdangarin was convicted of embezzling around € 6.2 million of public funds, and sent to jail. The princess lost her “Duchess of Palma” title during the inquiry, but was herself acquitted of wrongdoing.

NORWAY

King Harald’s oldest child and fourth in line to the throne, Princess Martha Louise, dropped the “Royal Highness” part of her title in 2002, saying she wanted to pursue private interests, and married Norwegian writer Ari Behn that year.
