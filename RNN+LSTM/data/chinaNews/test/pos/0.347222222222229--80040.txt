Xi reportedly expressed ‘deep gratitude’ for the support of South Korea’s government and people during deadly outbreak

During 32-minute phone call, Moon said he was confident China would overcome the current challenge

Chinese President Xi Jinping and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in on Thursday spoke over the phone to discuss China’s efforts fighting the deadly coronavirus outbreak and the state of bilateral ties.

Chinese state media quoted Xi expressing his “deep gratitude” to the South Korean government and people for their help and support, noting both countries were important neighbours and partners for each other.

Bilateral ties were doing well, Xi said, adding that he and Moon had met in Beijing last year and arrived at a consensus on several important issues. He said the impact of the outbreak on economic and people-to-people ties were only temporary.

“I believe once we have overcome this outbreak, the good relationship between China and South Korea will deepen further and our cooperation will flourish even more,” Xi reportedly said.

According to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, during the 32-minute call, Moon expressed confidence China would overcome the current challenge, and Xi welcomed Moon’s statement that China’s suffering was also South Korea’s suffering.

The leaders agreed to share information about clinical trials and cooperate on future prevention measures. Xi, who was due to visit South Korea in the first half of the year, reaffirmed his plan to do so, Yonhap said.

They also agreed that the US and North Korea should resume their dialogue regarding denuclearisation efforts.

South Korea is a long-standing ally of the US but their bilateral ties have been fraught with tension over the Trump’s administration insistence Seoul pays more for the cost of stationing troops on the Korean peninsula.

Washington’s hardball tactics have angered even conservatives from Moon’s own party and raised questions about whether Seoul might turn to China for security and defence support.

Analysts do not believe the Washington-Seoul alliance that has been in place for more than six decades is at risk but agree current tensions have given China room to pursue closer ties with South Korea.

Bilateral ties between the two Asian neighbours have ensured rocky patches. In 2016, when South Korea agreed to host the US-built Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) missile system, Beijing reacted with fury over the perceived threat to its own security. It implemented an unofficial boycott targeting South Korean businesses in China and stopped tour groups from visiting the country.
