HEALTH authorities have confirmed a second coronavirus case on the Gold Coast.

A 42-year-old Chinese woman, who was travelling with the 44-year-old man diagnosed on Wednesday, is now isolated in Gold Coast University Hospital in stable condition.

All of the man’s companions, who include children, are currently in hospital and have been tested for the virus. They were staying at the Oracle building in Broadbeach.

They are among 41 people in Queensland who are awaiting the results of tests for the virus, which the World Health Organisation has now declared a global emergency.

Four of the Broadbeach group are unwell, four others are well. The children are among the group who are unwell.

‘WE SHARED A LIFT’: FEAR GRIPS RESORT AT CENTRE OF CORONAVIRUS CASE

The infected man arrived to the Gold Coast at 8pm Monday night on Tiger Air flight TT566 from Melbourne.

Health authorities have contacted all 157 passengers who were on the flight.

A Tiger Air spokeswoman said the airline had contacted all passengers on the flight and provided their details to Queensland Health to discuss prevention measures and other queries.

After arriving in the Gold Coast on Monday, the man who has since tested positive for coronavirus travelled to the Oracle building in Broadbeach, where he became increasingly unwell.

He had first arrived in Melboune on the 22nd of January, on a flight via Singapore from Wuhan.

Authorities are now working to retrace the man’s steps.

“We are working with the hotel management,” Queensland Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young said.

“He was only there for 24 hours.”

Dr Young has been granted emergency powers which would allow health authorities in Queensland to forcibly detain and treat suspected coronavirus victims.

The Public Health Emergency Order was approved by Health Minister Steven Miles.

CORONAVIRUS SET TO STOP MORE FLIGHTS FROM CHINA

Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk yesterday convened a whole of government meeting with a range of agencies to discuss the state’s response to the virus.

“My message today to Queensland families is please listen to the authorities,” she said.

“We need everyone to be calm.

Shipments of additional face masks have been distributed to GP clinics across the Gold Coast.

Gold Coast council is preparing to move to offer support to Queensland Health.

Mayor Tom Tate briefed councillors on the situation at a full council meeting yesterday afternoon.

After the meeting he revealed council will assist Queensland Health in setting up fever testing centres on the Gold Coast in order to alleviate pressure on the city’s hospitals.

General Practice Gold Coast Chair Dr Katrina McLean said many patients presenting to doctors locally have been vigilant and followed health directives.

A number of GPs in the city are now equipped to see patients and test, however NSW residents suspected of having the virus are advised to go directly to hospital.

According to medical experts, patients may not initially be aware they are unwell.

“Symptoms can be quite minor,” Dr McLean said.

“We really want to identify and test anyone who has travelled from China or who has been in contact with someone unwell with coronavirus so that we can test them and advise them on home isolation.

“Advice is still very much to phone first, and be guided by the practice or public health unit.

“It is changing every day.”

It is also understood additional face masks will be sent to GP clinics across the Gold Coast.
