Bombardier Transportation China president Jianwei Zhang said: “We are very honoured to be awarded this maintenance service contract at the beginning of this year. Our team’s skills and experience across the portfolio will ensure we deliver a high-quality maintenance service.



“In China, we bring together integrated designing, manufacturing and maintenance service expertise to support our customers’ strategic goals, and we look forward to contributing further to the development of China’s railway industry.”
