After close consultation with stakeholders regarding travel and safety concerns around the coronavirus, the Malaysian International Furniture Fair (MIFF) 2020 has been rescheduled from 6-9th March to 30th June to 3rd July. It will take place at the Malaysia International Trade and Exhibition Centre (MITEC).

According to organiser Informa Markets, the decision was taken with regret, but some countries have already restricted staff travel.

“In light of the constantly evolving situation, we have taken the difficult decision to reschedule the event. We appreciate the international buyers who had looked forward to attending the show in March and hope to have their continued support to attend on the new date. MIFF has built a global reputation over the past 25 years and serves buyers from 140 countries and regions. With the new dates, we will continue our work to generate more business opportunities for the show. Also, we offer our sincere sympathies to those who have been affected by the virus in China and other countries,” says Datuk Dr Tan Chin Huat, MIFF's founder and chairman.

Dato’ Sri Abdul Khani bin Daud, CEO of the Malaysia Convention & Exhibition Bureau (MyCEB), adds: “The COVID-19 situation in Malaysia is under control. The health situation is being managed by the Ministry of Health, National Disaster Management Agency and various other ministries and agencies under a committee chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, YAB Dato' Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail. We have been adhering to the precautions and safety measures as recommended by the WHO, and are taking their guidance and recommendations seriously.

"We understand the organiser of MIFF’s decision to reschedule the show due to the impact on international travels and other commercial considerations. It is my sincere hope that the delegates would benefit from the event and take the opportunity to experience Malaysia in conjunction with Visit Malaysia 2020. On behalf of MyCEB, I look forward to welcoming all international buyers to Malaysia and wish all of you an enjoyable and fruitful event in June 2020.”

Organised by Informa Markets, MIFF is the biggest furniture trade show in South-east Asia. Last year, the show attracted over 600 Malaysian and foreign exhibitors, and more than 20,000 visitors including over 6000 international buyers.

Meanwhile, Malaysia's Export Furniture Exhibtion (EFE), which was scheduled to take place from 9-12th March, has been pushed back to late August following a meeting on 17th February between the show's exhibitors and its organiser, EFE Expo. It will take place at the KLCC venue.

EFE is the latest major trade event to be postponed, following the news that China's March exhibitions – including CIFF, 3F, CIFE and Design Shanghai – would be pushed back. See the related articles for more insight.
