Presently, the ITBP personnel are deployed on border guarding duties from Ladakh's Karakoram Pass to Arunachal Pradesh's Jachep La covering 3,488 km of the Indo-China border and manning Border Outposts on altitudes ranging from 9,000 to 18,700 in the Western, Middle and Eastern sectors of the Indo-China border.

The ITBP is a specialised mountain force in which most of the officers are professionally trained mountaineers and skiers. The force which is the first responder for natural disaster has been conducting several rescue and relief operations across the country.
