The Queen's grandson has appeared in a milk advert in China, fuelling a discussion about how Prince Harry and Meghan might make their money as they step away from royal duties.

Peter Phillips, the eldest son of Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, touts his position as a member of the Royal Family in an advert for milk and appears against a backdrop of a stately home.

In the advert, he appears surrounded by luxury as he accepts a glass of milk from a butler on a tray.

While in one part he appears to be at a country manor, thought to be Longleat House, he's then seen looking out over the Shanghai skyline.

Raising his glass at the end of the commercial he says: "This is what I drink."

The tagline reads: "British royal family member, Peter Phillips."

According to reports, two adverts for Chinese company Bright Dairies are being broadcast on Dragon TV.

Mr Phillips is also reported to talk about Jersey as part of the royal estate, as the camera shows cows eating grass in a field.

The company behind the ads, Guangming Food Group, also shared a behind-the-scenes video in which Mr Phillips introduces himself and says he has been "fortunate" to travel around the world.

He says: "As children, we used to spend a lot of time down at the dairy.

"There was a herd of cattle in Windsor, and we were brought up on it. It was also much more full of flavour and much creamier than other milks."

He also tells of how he has been to Shanghai "a number of times" and enjoys his trips there.

In the behind-the-scenes, he says: "'Bright Dairies has got a fantastic reputation all over China and outside of China as well, for producing high quality dairy products."

He adds that it is a "privilege" to be part of the project of "bringing Jersey milk to China" adding: "I hope it will be a success".

Mr Phillips has never had a royal title, nor has his sister Zara Tindall, and the pair have come under some scrutiny in the past for how they make their money.

Mr Phillips and his wife sold their wedding to Hello! magazine in a 100-page special in 2008 and Mrs Tindall is a brand ambassador for Land Rover.

But the siblings have never carried out royal duties. Mr Phillips is currently 15th in line to the throne.

While Prince Harry and Meghan suggested there was a "precedent" for earning money as a royal, it has not been done by a senior member of the family who carried out royal duties.

Harry's other cousins, Beatrice and Eugenie, also work and don't receive an allowance for royal duties.

Some experts say the Sussexes, who won't use their HRH titles from spring onwards, could be worth about £500m. The details of how they will strive for financial independence are not clear, but Netflix has already expressed an interest in working with them.

Prince Harry flew back to Vancouver Island to be reunited with his wife who has been staying there with their son Archie.

Buckingham Palace and Mr Phillips have not commented. Sky News has contacted Longleat House for comment.
