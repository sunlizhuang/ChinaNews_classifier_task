Excerpts:

Dear friends,

The ICA-AP team wishes you Happy Holidays and a Prosperous 2020! Our holiday card captures the diversity we have in the office – years with ICA-AP, gender, age, regions. This diversity is also reflected in the Asia-Pacific region – members, culture, history, approach. What pulls us together is the common cause – advancement of people-centered model of business – cooperatives!

The highlight of the year was ICA President Ariel Guarco’s visit to eight countries in the region – China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam! At the end of his visit, President Guarco said, “In Asia, the cooperative movement has very diverse organizations. We have large enterprises that compete in the market with very powerful capitalist companies; others with small productive units meet the needs at local level. There is a clear commitment to sustainable development and comprehension that integration among cooperatives, within each country, in each region and worldwide, is what makes us a key tool to meet the objectives set by the United Nations to build a more just, solidary and peaceful world.” A first-person account of Mr. Guarco’s visit can be found at: http://ica-ap.coop/icanews/travels-ica-president-20-balu-iyer-regional-director-ica-ap
