JAMMU, Jan 11: In a significant statement, Army chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane said today that his force can take control of Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) if it gets orders from the political authority and added the Army has full support of the people of Jammu and Kashmir as he lauded local police and administration for their support to the troops.

Describing situation on the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir as “very active”, he said due to alertness, the Army has been able to foil number of actions known as “BAT (Border Action Team) actions”.

Addressing a press conference in the Union capital, his first after taking over as Chief of Army Staff, ahead of Army Day which is observed on January 15, Gen Naravane, in what is being seen as strong message to Islamabad, said: “there is a Parliamentary resolution that entire Jammu and Kashmir is part of India. If Parliament wants it, then, PoK also should belong to us. When we get orders to that effect, we will take appropriate action”.

The Parliament had passed a resolution in February 1994 declaring that Pakistan must vacate the areas of Jammu and Kashmir, which it has occupied through aggression, and resolved that all attempts made by Pakistan to interfere in India’s internal affairs be dealt with resolutely.

Replying to question on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and Line of Control (LoC), Gen Naravane said everyone in Jammu and Kashmir, be it on the LoC or hinterland, has been doing commendable job.

“We have full support of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. We are grateful to local police and administration who support us. They don’t have a harsh word to say about the Army,” he added.

The Chief of Army Staff said the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir has been very active and Intelligence alerts are received on daily basis and they are looked into very seriously. “Due to this alertness, we have been able to foil these actions known as BAT actions’.

On yesterday’s BAT action in the border district of Poonch in Jammu region in which two porters were martyred and three injured, Gen Naravane said: “We don’t resort to such barbaric activities and fight as a very professional force. We will deal appropriately with such situations in a military manner”.

It may be mentioned here that yesterday, two porters were killed and three injured in the BAT action at forward village of Kasalian in Gulpur sector of Poonch district. The BAT had beheaded one of the martyr porters.

Responding to a question on Army’s operational priorities, he said: “As far as Indian Army is concerned, for us the short term threat is counter insurgency operations, and long term threat is the conventional wars and that is what we are preparing for”.

Replying to another question on alleged complaints against Army officers deployed in Kashmir Valley, the Army chief said the judgment call of the Commander on ground have to be respected. All the complaints that have been filed have proved to be unfounded, he added.

He said the Indian Army is a professional force and conducts itself in most professional and ethical manner in peace, on LoC and in combat.

He said the Army is deployed on the border safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity, it is to secure for our people these core values. “And I think, this is what we need to keep in mind,” he added.

“Indian Army is much better prepared today than before,” he said on preparedness of the troops in view of shortages cited earlier by the Army vice chief two years ago.

Gen Naravane also said that the Army will remain very vigilant at the Siachen Glacier, the highest battlefield in the world which was the first forward area to be visited by the Army chief after taking over on December 31, as there was a possibility of collusion between China and Pakistan against India in the strategically sensitive area.

“We need to hold on to it. This can take place at any level, but Siachen and Shaksgam Valley are the places where the territory of these two countries meets,” the Army chief said.

On need for re-balancing the Force on both Pakistan and China borders, Gen Naravane said the re-balancing is required as there is a feeling that both Northern and Western borders require equal attention.

“In case of threats from both fronts, there will be a primary and secondary front. Wherever there is primary front, we will deploy bulk of forces. On secondary front, we will ensure that we are not found wanting. That’s why we have dual front Task Forces,” Gen Naravane said.

To a question on the fratricides over Srinagar (Budgam IAF chopper crash) in February 2019 and recent one in Iran, he asserted that the formation of Air Defence Command will help ensure that there are no fratricides as far as “we are concerned”.

“We are prepared to deal with challenges along northern border,” the Army chief said when asked about China enhancing military infrastructure.

“We are initiating rebalancing of preparedness along northern border, including moving advanced weapon systems,” he said.

He said the focus will be on integration within the Army and among the three Services.

Gen Naravane asserted that the conduct of the 1.3 million-strong Army will be guided by its “allegiance” to the Constitution and its core values of justice, liberty, equality and fraternity, comments which came in the backdrop of criticism that the military was politicized under his predecessor.

He also said that a “rebalancing” of the overall preparedness along the border with China has been initiated and a raft of measures are being taken including moving advanced weapon systems.

Talking about his overall focus as chief of the Army, Gen Naravane said it will be ‘ABC’ — “Allegiance, Belief and Consolidation”, noting that protecting the core values of the Constitution will remain the driving force of his personnel.

“We swear allegiance to the Constitution of India. Be it officers or jawans, we have taken oath to protect the Constitution and that is what should guide us in all time and all our actions,” the Army Chief said.

“What it translates into is also the core values which are enshrined in the Preamble to the Constitution which are justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. That is what we are fighting for,” he said.

Gen Naravane also said that his other focus areas would be ‘ITPQ’ — which he explained as Integration, Training Personnel and Quality.

He said integration of purposes within the Army and with the two other forces would be a key area for him.

“The formation of the Chief of Defence Staff and the creation of a department of military affairs is a very big step towards integration. We on our part will make sure that this is a success,” the Army chief said.

“Integration will also be within the Army and the integrated battle group is just one example of that. But I also want to assure everyone that in this process of integration, we will take everyone along. Nobody will be left behind,” he said

The Army chief said the focus of training will be on preparing the Army for future wars which he said will be network-centric and complex.

He said the personnel were the “greatest strength” in the Army, adding “quality and not quantity will be the mantra, be it the selection of personnel or equipment.”

“We are in a transformative stage and all the transformation that we are doing, we will have to consolidate upon them. We will have to carry forward the initiatives and policies set by my predecessor and make sure that all of them reach a logical conclusion,” the Army chief said.

“Of course somewhere along the way, there will be mid-course correction,” he said.

Gen Naravane termed the creation of the post of Chief of Defence Staff a “very big step” towards integration of the three forces and said the Army will ensure its success.

“The formation of the CDS and the creation of a department of military affairs is a very big step towards integration. We on our part will make sure that this is a success,” the Army chief said.
