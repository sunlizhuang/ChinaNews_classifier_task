LETTERS:BUKIT Bintang is known for being one of the most vibrant metropolitan hubs in Kuala Lumpur. The area regularly attracts crowds of shoppers, tourists and business workers to its trendy shopping centres, five-star hotels, restaurants and nightspots.

However, this was not the case last Wednesday at 7am.The streets were quiet and deserted during my walkabout.

I spent my time admiring the colourful Chinese New Year decorations and snapped some pictures along the way. The festival is not as widely celebrated in Sydney as it is in Malaysia, nor is it a national holiday.

Since arriving in KL some three weeks ago, I’ve been taught by locals that red lanterns are believed to drive away bad luck in Chinese culture.

They also signify booming life and a prosperous business, which was appropriate for the purpose of my visit.

Artificial cherry blossom trees had also been erected and ornamented with hanging fortune cookies to recreate the classic ‘wishing tree’.

Attendees of the media briefing were encouraged to retrieve a fortune cookie and replace it with a handwritten wish of their own.

The notes were anonymous, and it was heartwarming to find that the hopes and dreams of Malaysians do not differ so greatly from those of my friends and family back home in Australia.

As is common in busy industrial cities, many of the attendees made wishes for success and prosperity in their lives.

Others wished for happiness and health for their families - desires that seem representative of the human condition we all experience in every corner of the world.

Later on, I visited the popular Pavilion Kuala Lumpur shopping mall for lunch. The main entrance led to a fun, elaborate display of Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse to commemorate 2020 as the Year of the Rat on the Chinese zodiac calendar.

I felt excited and privileged that I was able to participate in the Chinese New Year celebrations and witness how Malaysia’s remarkably diverse population comes together for the occasion.
