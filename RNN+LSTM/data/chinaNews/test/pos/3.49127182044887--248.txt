The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge want to help address the growing environmental problems in the planet. The royal couple announced a decade-long global effort focused on climate issues and innovation to “repair the Earth.”

Prince William and Kate Middleton introduced the Earthshot Prize that aims to encourage individuals and organizations to find ways or develop tools that would help solve existing problems in the environment. Five winners will receive a cash prize every year from 2021 to 2030, the BBC reported Tuesday.

"The earth is at a tipping point and we face a stark choice: either we continue as we are and irreparably damage our planet or we remember our unique power as human beings and our continual ability to lead, innovate and problem-solve," Prince William said.

The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will manage the first parts of Earthshot. The royal couple said it would eventually become an independent organization.

Earthshot Prize will involve a series of challenges aimed at finding 50 solutions to the "world's greatest problems," such as climate change and air pollution. The competition will begin in late 2020, at a time when global leaders, advocates and organizations will meet at the Convention on Biodiversity in China and the COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow.

Sir David Attenborough, who announced Earthshot on social media, said the prize would go to "visionaries rewarded over the next decade for responding to the great challenges of our time." More than 60 organizations and experts supported the development of the prize.

Earthshot is inspired by former U.S. President John F. Kennedy's "Moonshot" announcement in 1961 about his plans to send American astronauts to the moon’s surface before the end of that decade.

It is not the first time Prince William expressed concerns with the growing problems in the environment. In October, he and the duchess visited a melting glacier in Pakistan, where they called on more education and political action to address the effects of climate change.

Prince William also serves as president of conservation group United for Wildlife and as patron of the Tusk conservation charity. In 2019, he launched a collaboration with Sir David at the World Economic Forum.
