Today, Chinese leader Xí Jìnpíng 习近平 made his first public appearance in eight days, welcoming Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen to Beijing, the SCMP reports. Xi did not wear a mask and appeared healthy, despite some rumors to the contrary.

“Learn from Cambodia’s PM 洪森” (Hóng Sēn, Hun Sen) is the well-argued advice of an anonymous Twitter user, @itrulyknowchina, who has made credible claims to being a state media insider. Their key points, summarized:

“It’s not expensive, nor risky: Donate a reasonably large amount of face masks and/or other useful medical equipment to Chinese government, publish a letter confessing your appreciation of Beijing’s efforts to combat coronavirus and confidence in them, and a brief trip to Beijing.”
