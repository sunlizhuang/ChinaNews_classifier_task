The New Forces of Literature Series published by Shandong Urban Publishing Media Group & Jinan Publishing House was recently released in Beijing.

Tie Ning, President of the Chinese Writers Association (CWA), Mo Yan, Director of the International Writing Center of Beijing Normal University (BNU), other leaders of the CWA, and a number of writers and scholars attended the ceremony.

The series of 12 volumes gathers the works of 12 young contemporary Chinese writers.

The writers are students of a writers' graduate class offered by Lunxun Literature School and the BNU. In their works, they use stories that keep abreast of the times to express love, warmth and faith.

As early as 1988, many renowned writers including Mo Yan, winner of Nobel Prize for literature, Liu Zhenyun whose works have been adapted into many movies, female writers Chi Zijian and Yan Geling were students of the class. Three terms of classes have been held, which have recruited 56 young writers, editors and literature workers since 2017.

Jidimajia, vice president of the CWA, said that the series showcases the creative strength of the class' young writers and the achievement of contemporary Chinese literature.

Ge Fei, writer and professor of Tsinghua University, also one of the tutors of the writers' graduate class, said that the books provide a convenient way for people to read the works of China's young writers.
