Two giant pandas from the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, Ya Shuang and Er Xi, recently had great fun in the first snow of winter in Wild World Jinan, a wildlife park in Jinan, capital of east China’s Shandong Province.

“These two had great fun this time. It’s the first snow of winter in Jinan. I feel so relieved to see you two enjoy yourselves in the snow,” said a giant panda keeper in Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding after receiving messages about the giant pandas enjoying the snow in Jinan.

“Giant pandas in southern China yearn for snow more than southern people do,” according to experts from the giant panda base, explaining that wild giant pandas usually live in high-altitude areas, and spend most of their time in snowy mountains.

They have adapted themselves to their environment during the past 8 million years and grown thick fur and the black and white coat color that enables them to hide in snowfields, said experts.
