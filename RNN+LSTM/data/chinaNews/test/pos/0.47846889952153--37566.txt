K–12 Ed Tech Investments Dive

The latest "2019 Global Learning Technology Investment Patterns" report from Metaari declared that a "breathtaking $18.66 billion flowed to ed tech companies around the world in 2019" — the "highest in the history" of the industry, "[blasting] past the records set between 2015 and 2017 and far [outpacing] the historic high in 2018."

As Metaari CEO and Chief Researcher Sam Adkins noted, funding for higher ed-specific tech companies increased in 2019 to $740.6 million, 80 percent higher than the $406.8 million given to these companies in 2018.

Meanwhile, funding to the Pre-K–12 sector did the opposite, dropping by almost half in 2019. While investments to Pre-K–12 in 2018 reached $1.4 billion, that declined to $855 million in 2019, a reduction of 39 percent.

Yet, overall, both markets together made up a small fraction of the total investments plowed into ed tech for the year — just 8.6 percent (compared to 21.4 percent in 2017 and 11.2 percent in 2018). Higher ed received 4 percent of total funding for the year, and Pre-K–12 took 4.6 percent.

The cause?

There may not be anything in particular. As Adkins wrote, "Investment trends are inherently unpredictable, and this could be an anomaly."

Likewise, he added, those percentages "are heavily skewed by the massive investments going to consumer and corporate deals." Corporate learning investment drew $10.4 billion for the year (up from $6.2 billion in 2018), while consumer learning investment attracted $6.7 billion (down from $8.6 billion in 2018)

Adkins has divided the ed tech product landscape into 10 broad categories, three that are "legacy" and seven that are "next-generation." Legacy products include self-paced courseware, digital "reference-ware" and collaboration-based learning. The next-generation products cover:

Cognitive learning;

Artificial-based learning;

Mixed reality learning;

5G and mobile learning;

Location-based learning;

Game-based learning; and

Educational bots (both physical and virtual).

Adkins' report declared three "big winners" for overall 2019 investments:
