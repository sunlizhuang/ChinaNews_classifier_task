ROCHESTER, Minn. (FOX 47) - Sunday marks the second day of the 15 day long Chinese New Year celebration.



Tiffany Alexandria, a Taiwanese food blogger, taught community members about the tea ceremony that's practiced during the holiday.

"The tea that we're tasting today are all from Taiwan. And we are tasting tea ranges from live fermentation to slightly more fermented and all the way up to black tea," Alexandria said.

Alexandria said tea plays a daily role in Chinese culture.

"So tea is more like an everyday lifestyle. There is a tea ceremony but we just drink tea everyday. And during Chinese New Year, it's often visiting family every single day and as soon as you get to each family relatives house you sit down and drink tea with them," she said.

Alexandria's family is currently in Tawain. She said her uncle played a huge role in her love for tea.

"My uncle's a tea maker. He's a master tea maker in Taiwan actually. So, when I was little growing up I would actually visit him on the tea mountain and watch him make tea," she said.

Although Alexandra can't be with her family this Chinese New Year, those who attended the tea party felt grateful she shared a big part of her life with them."

"I've learned a lot about the tea leaf. I've learned the different types of tea and the process of making it and the process of enjoying it," Julie Herrera- Lemar, said.

Alexandria said on Thursday she will be teaching people how to make dumplings.
