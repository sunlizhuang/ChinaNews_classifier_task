BEIJING, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng on Sunday called for efforts to ensure food safety through the modernization of the governance system and capacity for food safety.

Han, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and head of the food safety commission of the State Council, made the remarks while presiding over a meeting of the commission.

More work should be done in key fields, while supervision efficiency should be improved, especially supervision at its source, he said.

Food safety standards should be upgraded gradually so that they can not only meet the leading international levels, but also reflect China's national conditions, Han said.

When facing food safety problems, the authorities should respond to people's concerns in a timely manner and provide accurate information, he said.
