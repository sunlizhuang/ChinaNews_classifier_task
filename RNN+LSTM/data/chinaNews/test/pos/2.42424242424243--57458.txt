Culver-Stockton College student Nick Bringer presents the Badge of Honor 5K Run medal to Alyce Bava, whose son, James Bava, lost his life in the line of duty. Hannibal native and former Hannibal Police officer Seth McBride created a class for a select group of students called In the Line of Duty, stemming from an idea in 2018 for a project to honor the memory of men and women who died in the line of duty. The Fallen Soldier Project has become a yearly tradition since, with students interacting with law enforcement departments and family members as they honor an officer from nearby communities or across the world.

CANTON, Mo. | A Culver Stockton criminal justice professor's idea has grown into a special class at Culver-Stockton College culminating in an opportunity for select students each spring to honor men and women who lost their lives in the line of duty.

Hannibal native and commissioned sheriff's deputy Seth Mc-Bride served with the Hannibal Police Department from 2003 to 2012, and he wanted to honor officers who gave the ultimate sacrifice through the volunteer-driven Fallen Officer Project he created in 2018. The volunteer project quickly gained administrative approval, and today Mc-Bride carefully selects a group of nine or ten students to enroll in his In the Line of Duty class and participate in the Fallen Officer Project each spring.

“I wanted something to show respect for the officers who lost their lives in the line of duty, and at the same time, teach something to our next generation — especially in the field — coming in at the college level,” McBride said.

The Fallen Officer Project begins with students selecting an officer who died in the line of duty — they could be from Missouri, other communities in the U.S. or from across the world. McBride said many CS-C students hail from various communities in the U.S. and throughout the world, and they often select an officer from their hometown or local area as they begin the project. Before the students can research an officer's life and service, they make sure to get approval from family members and from the department. Each student writes a paper and conducts a presentation based on their findings. In March, students put together a presentation of the officers through Facebook Live, sharing the background of the officer's life with pictures and a synopsis. The live broadcast has reached more than 200,000 people.

After the live presentation, McBride takes the students to the Badge of Honor 5K Run in Poplar Bluff. The run supports multiple charities dedicated to first responders, and each student runs with a custom Fallen Officer Project t-shirt with a picture of the officer they represent on the back.

“They run for that officer, and then when they complete the run, they send off the finishing medal as well as a formal letter thanking the department and/or the family for letting them represent them,” Mc-Bride said.

McBride said students interact with department officers and family members of the fallen officer through the “life-changing” experience. During the first year, Alyce Bava came to the Badge of Honor run, and student Nick Bringer personally presented the medal to her in honor of her late son, James Bava. McBride said there are many strong connections made, and the students are dedicated to the cause through every stage. Fellow student Eric Pingolt had the opportunity to present the medal and letter to the widow and son of officer Blake C. Snyder at the park dedicated in his memory.

“Every student has put their heart and soul into it, and they really understand more and more once they start getting engaged with the officer and what they did for the community, and the family members who are willing to open up to my students and share memories and things,” McBride said. “It's been great.”

Junior Dalton Huffman, of Hannibal, said he is about halfway through the steps to complete the Fallen Officer Project with fellow students. He said everyone involved shares a serious dedication to the cause — he remembered submitting his application and how he and his colleagues were “hand-picked” for the endeavor.

“I'm very excited about it. It's an honor to be in this class, because I look at it like an opportunity to represent somebody who died in the line of duty, somebody who is brave and somebody who should be remembered as so,” Huffman said. “I can't even put into words how excited I am to do this.”
