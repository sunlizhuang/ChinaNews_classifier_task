HANOI, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- Song Tao, head of the International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, has stressed to promote the development of China-Vietnam relations in the new era.

Song made the remarks during his visit to Vietnam from Monday to Wednesday, ahead of the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Vietnam.

China-Vietnam ties are essentially the relations between two socialist countries under the leadership of communist parties, Song said.

He said China stands ready to consolidate and promote the traditional China-Vietnam friendship, taking the 70th anniversary of the two countries' diplomatic ties as an opportunity, and push forward the development of China-Vietnam relations in the new era.

During his visit, Song met with Tran Quoc Vuong, a politburo member and permanent member of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) Central Committee's Secretariat, and Hoang Binh Quan, head of the Commission for External Relations of the CPV Central Committee.

The Vietnamese senior officials spoke highly of the visit of Song and his delegation, praising it as a successful kick-off of the events marking the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

They said Vietnam is willing to work with China to consolidate the traditional friendship, deepen the exchanges and cooperation, and benefit both peoples.
