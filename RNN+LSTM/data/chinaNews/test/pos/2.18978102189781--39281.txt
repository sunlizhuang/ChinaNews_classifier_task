About 40 people gathered near Port Taranaki to protest live export and plans to ship about 4000 cows to China.

About 40 protesters gathered near Port Taranaki to show their opposition to live export on Friday.

Organised by animal welfare advocacy group SAFE, the protesters opposed the Yangzte Fortune, which was in port to collect, and then transport, about 4000 cows to China.

Safe spokesperson Will Appelbe said they had people tooting support but also some disagreeing.

He said it wasn't just full-scale animal activists taking part.

"They're everyday New Zealanders who are concerned about the treatment of animals in live export."

Charlotte Poles Smith, of New Plymouth, said in New Zealand there was a culture of caring for and respecting animals.

"But once people offer them money they are willing to put ethics behind them."

New Plymouth councillor Anneka Carlson said she did not like the fact that animals were being sent into the unknown.

"It's almost like we care because we have to care, but if we get a better offer like sending them overseas, well who cares?"

Carlson said a group, separate from Safe, were also planning to protest at the end of the lee breakwater about 11pm on Friday as the cows were loaded onto the ship.

Leonie Jarvis, member of the Taranaki Animal Protection Trust, said live export was a violation of what was accepted as rights for animals in New Zealand.

"This is a hellish trip. When they get there they're beyond our protection."

The practice is under review and "we're hoping the Minister for Primary Industries will ban all live export,"Jarvis said.

Live export for slaughter was banned in 2003, but it is still allowed for breeding purposes.

The Yangtze Fortune is scheduled to leave Port Taranaki at 1.30pm on Saturday bound for Tianjin, China.

In 2018, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority recommended the Yangtze Fortune be allowed to sail for no more than 10 days with stock on board.

During a voyage from Australia to China the same year, 33 cattle died.

However, the exporter has all their Government certifications and authorisations in place, Port Taranaki chief executive Guy Roper said in a statement.

"Port Taranaki recognises people are interested in and have views around this type of transportation, and we respect people's right to protest in a peaceful and safe way.

"We would like to reiterate that Port Taranaki isn't an exporter - we provide a facility for exporters."
