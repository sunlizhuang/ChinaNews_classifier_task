Xiaomi’s entry-level Mi range of fitness smart bands have been a popular choice among consumers. The latest Mi Band 4, launched in September, features a coloured AMOLED display and a host of new features. Xiaomi is now rumoured to be working on its successor, dubbed as the Mi Band 5.

The Mi Band 5 will sport a bigger and better display compared to the Mi Band 4, according to a Tizen Help report. The budget fitness smart band is said to feature a 1.2-inch OLED touchscreen panel, which is notably bigger than the Mi Band 4’s 0.95-inch display. The brighter screen will also have better contrast for better visibility even under direct sunlight.

Another Mi Band 5 feature that would be a part of the global variant is NFC support. The feature has been present in previous Mi Band variants and is said to be made available globally with the Mi Band 5.

The inclusion of NFC on global variants will pave the way for Google Pay support. Currently, Mi band 3 and Mi Band 4 support Mi Pay in China.

As far as pricing is concerned, Mi Band 5 is expected to launch for Yuan 179 (roughly Rs 1,800). Xiaomi has not confirmed the launch details as yet. However, Huami, the wearable technology provider for Xiaomi has confirmed that Mi Band 5 will launch first in China in June 2020, according to the report.
