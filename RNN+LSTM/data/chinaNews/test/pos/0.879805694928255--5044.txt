William Shakespeare’s Comedies, Histories, & Tragedies, known as the First Folio, could fetch between $4 million and $6 million at an upcoming auction at Christie’s New York.

The book was published in 1623 by his friends and fellow actors John Heminges and Henry Condell after Shakespeare died in 1616 at age 52. Containing 36 of Shakespeare’s plays, the First Folio is the first authoritative collection of his plays and ranks as one of the greatest works of world literature.

The copy was offered for sale from the collection of Mills College in Oakland, Calif. It’s one of only six complete copies known to exist in private hands and was once owned by Shakespeare scholar Edmond Malone, according to Christie’s.
