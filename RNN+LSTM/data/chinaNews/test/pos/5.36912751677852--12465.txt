For all our programs we guide you through the whole process from the first contact, to arriving in China, to finishing your program and moving on. Most of the TDC-team have been teachers themselves and we make sure that you will be in safe hands with us for your Chinese adventure.



Throughout the year we run a social programme for our teachers with days out in Sichuan (e.g. Panda sanctuary, ancient villages) and events (e.g. BBQs), so you can meet and mingle with fellow teachers and have fun with us.
