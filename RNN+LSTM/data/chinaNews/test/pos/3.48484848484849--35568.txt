MANSFIELD – Mansfield High School senior Lily Barnes has a 3.89 grade point average but her class rank is 79th.

A little as of .1 GPA difference can mean a swing of dozens of places on a ranking while demonstrating very little academic difference between students, according to a presentation on Jan. 21 by MHS Principal Mary Watkins and Guidance director Tina Karidoyanes.

This is one of the reasons, Watkins asked the School Committee to consider abolishing the class ranking system.

In 2019, the top 19 students’ GPAs were less than one tenth of a point apart, Watkins said. There were 31 students with GPAs of between 4.25 and 4.5 and 74 students with a GPA of more than 4.0 in a class of 327 students, Karidoyanes said.

In 2018, there were 43 students out of 289 with GPAs over 4.0. In 2017, there were 68 students out of 326 with GPAs over 4.0.

Class rank is based on grade point average with more weight given to honors and advanced placement courses. Students first find out their class rank in the fall of their sophomore year.

Class ranking benefits the top 10 students especially those named valedictorian and salutatorian in the competition for acceptance into college, Watkins said.

“It can be motivating,” she said.

But at the same time, students with high GPAs like Barnes can be hurt by class rank both in college acceptance and winning scholarships.

“At some schools (class rank) limits your scholarship opportunities,” Barnes said.

“Class rank should not define a student,” Watkins said. “It’s really not helping these students.”

Karidoyanes said eliminating class rank gives colleges “a more holistic view” of students.

“A student with a GPA of 4.01 but a rank of 51 is not given the appropriate consideration because of his or her rank,” she said. “Rankings can be a detriment to strong students getting into the college of their choice.”

Class rank is also not required by colleges.

Karidoyanes said there is a trend of public school moving away from class ranking. Public schools which no long using ranking include Canton, Medfield, Millis, Norwood, Sharon, Walpole and Westwood. Private schools including Boston College High, Thayer Academy, Xaverian and Milton Academy have also abolished ranking.

Students focused on their rank might only take classes which would boost their numbers instead of something they might be interested in, Watkins said.

“We want students to be able to take courses they are interested in,” she said. “They miss an opportunity to discover what their passion is.”

Barnes, who is the MHS representative to the School Committee, added that concern about class ranking can become “an unhealthy competition” among students.

“I see friends struggle to take several (advanced placement courses) to boost their grades,” Barnes said. “I think a student is more than a number.”

“It gets really toxic,” School Committee member Lynn Cavicchi agreed. “Students are competing against each other in this numbers race.

“We want to foster an environment where every student is learning for learning sake and what they are passionate about.”

Watkins said her recommendation comes after two years of research and meetings with students, staff and parents. Watkins said parents and staff generally support eliminating class rank with some students having reservation.

If adopted, the ranking would eliminated with the Class of 2023.

School Committee Chairman Kiera O’Neil said the charts of statistics really demonstrated the point. She supported the idea as long as the district continues to find ways to honor top students.

“Valedictorian and salutatorian are important,” O’Neil said.

If class rank is eliminated, there will still be a valedictorian and salutatorian chosen with calculation made just before graduation, Watkins said.

“Valedictorian and salutatorian are important and we don’t’ want to take away from that honor,” Watkins said.

She said she also like to add more ways to honor high performing students.

“One thing I’m really passionate about is developing new recognition for top performing students,” Watkins said.

The School Committee will vote whether to eliminate ranking at its Feb. 11 meeting.
