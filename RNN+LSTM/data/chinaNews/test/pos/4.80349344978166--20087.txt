In 2019, NorthGlass represents "created in China

In January 2019, at the BAU in Germany, a foreign customer, after seeing the glass products of NorthGlass, made a heartfelt exclamation: 30 years ago, China's industrial base was almost zero, but now, your development speed is so fast, it's wonderful to see these glass "artworks" from China here!

Do you feel that kind of sincere praise?

In February 2019, Henan satellite TV's "news broadcast" program filmed excellent enterprises with the theme of "actively explore the market and spare no effort to get off to a flying start", and met with the famous British enterprise customer who came to make the acceptance check of the tempering furnace. He told the reporter: "After our actual acceptance test, this equipment has reached a very high level of performance in terms of quality and technical indicators. I believe that products of NorthGlass will certainly have a profound impact on the UK glass market. "

At the China International Glass Industrial Technical Exhibition held in May 2019, a picture of chairman Gao Xueming communicating with Group executives of Video, the largest glass group in North America, was posted on the overseas edition of China Daily after receiving a large number of customers and reaching a new high in order volume.

On September 17-19, 2019, at the GlassBuild America, NorthGlass received a big gift from the organizer NGA -- "BEST IN SHOW 2019" award with its astounded exhibits and simple but atmospheric booth design.

Still in September, Huawei's first global flagship store opened in Shenzhen MixC Shopping Mall, which known as the most “luxury”shopping mall in Shenzhen. This flagship store, with three words to describe is: Black technology! The specific technology is not clear, but the glass of NorthGlass is really dazzling.

This September is so awesome! Beijing Daxing International Airport, which took more than four years to build, was officially put into operation. As the first of the "seven wonders of the new world", the world once again witnessed the power of China. The difficult sunshade glass with built-in aluminum mesh is all produced by NorthGlass, which was permanently collected by the National Museum of China on November 5.

In October, black technology came again - "SiNest Unit Curtain Wall" came out and shinning the world. The raw materials of SiNest are from tailings and other waste and made by high temperature foaming. This new material has the function of high quality wall material: light weight and high strength, fire resistance and heat preservation, hydrophobic and moisture-proof, sound absorption and sound insulation, stability and durability, decoration as a whole.

Ms. Su Baolian, Consultant of The Architecture Society of Shanghai China Curtain Wall Specialized Committee, was very excited after attending the release conference of NorthGlass SiNest and composed an impromptu poem：Mountains are high and seas are deep, the road is far away. Science and technology battle out of death. Who dares to gallop ahead with sword drawn? Only we NortGlass SiNest!
