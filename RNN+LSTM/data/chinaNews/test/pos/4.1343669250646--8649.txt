The Tesla Model Y was revealed back in March 2019 and the first customer deliveries, according to the latest date given by the automaker, are set to get underway in summer 2020, some six months ahead of schedule. The only exception will reportedly be the Standard Range variant (also the most affordable beginning at $39,000), which is expected to arrive in early 2021. But today new information has come to light and it could mean Model Y deliveries are about to get underway.

Auto journalist Bozi Tatarevic posted on Twitter a leaked document revealing the CARB certificate for the Tesla Model Y Performance AWD that was published last week, on January 9. Why is this potentially significant? Because back in 2017, specifically on July 3, Tesla signed the Long Range RWD Model 3's certificate - exactly 25 days before the first deliveries began on July 28.
