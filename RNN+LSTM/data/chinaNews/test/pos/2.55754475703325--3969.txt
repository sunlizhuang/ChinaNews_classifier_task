These are defining times in Europe for the future of our lands and waters. Last month the European Commission announced the European Green Deal just 10 days after Ursula Von der Leyen took over the commission presidency (instead of the 100 days originally planned), clearly placing climate and environmental concerns at the top of EU priorities.

The Green Deal provides an ambitious road map for making Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050, including a zero-pollution action plan for air, water and soil in 2021; a Biodiversity Strategy to be defined by March 2020; and a “farm to fork” strategy to address all the stages of the food chain, in particular the use of pesticides and fertilizers in agriculture, which currently represents one of the main threats to water resources in Europe.

As significant investments are needed to achieve the ambition set by the European Green Deal, the Commission will present the Sustainable Europe Investment Plan to help meet the additional funding needs. It will combine dedicated financing to support sustainable investments and proposals for an improved enabling framework that is conducive to green investment.

The Commission will work with the European Investment Bank (EIB), which doubled its climate target from 25 percent to 50 percent by 2025 in order to become Europe's "climate bank." In the perspective of a more ambitious EU strategy on climate adaptation, the Commission will also call for public and private investments in nature-based solutions as part of the solution and support the adoption of natural capital approaches in Europe and internationally.

Such an agenda could not be more urgent. In her announcement speech, Von der Leyen pointed at the cost of inaction with respect to water security in particular, highlighting the costs of both river flooding and droughts to European citizens—and to the fact that the incidence of both events is likely to increase with climate change.
