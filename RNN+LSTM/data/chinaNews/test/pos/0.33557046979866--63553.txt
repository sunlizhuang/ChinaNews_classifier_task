OPINION: Our plane hit Auckland Airport's runway last night with a soft thud. It jolted me awake, my first thought: queues.

A few hours earlier, I was riding waves on Waikiki beach; it was such a beautiful day I ended up running late for the airport. Now, nine hours later, I was facing my first Auckland Airport experience since the coronavirus lockdown.

I expected snaking queues, with masks and temperature guns flying in all directions. It was nothing like that.

The coronavirus virus response in New Zealand has been one of contrast. Initially, we did nothing. Then, health officials decided it would be a good idea to hand out pamphlets.

A few days later, the pendulum swung hard - the Government banned all foreign travellers who had been in, or transited through, China in the previous 14 days. Air New Zealand cancelled its Shanghai service, and some Chinese carriers suspended services too.

Similarly, a week ago, a big crackdown was enforced at Customs. It announced eGates would be shut, and everybody would be processed manually by Customs officers. All international travellers know eGates are a godsend. Entering New Zealand typically takes a matter of seconds. No queues, no fuss.

Three days later, the rules changed again. Passengers from the United States, Singapore and Australia would once again be able to use eGates because the Ministry of Health was confident "of robust screening" in those countries. I laughed out loud when I read that.

This is the robust screening I was subject to in the United States: "Have you been to China in the past 14 days?" My response: "No". End of screening.

That's it - "robust screening" ... in 10 words.

So what to expect on the New Zealand end?

Our flight from Hawaii was full, and we piled off the plane in an unofficial race to get to our bags.

I counted eight small signs on the walk to Customs, taped to the wall, warning of coronavirus. It asked, "Have you been to China in the last 14 days OR have you been close to someone diagnosed with novel coronavirus?"

Additionally, it asked if I had a fever, cough or breathing difficulties. It appeared I was the only one who pulled over to read them.

If I answered yes to any of the questions, I needed to "tell our health staff immediately". It made no mention of where to find the health staff, or even who the health staff were. A tiny Auckland Regional Public Health Service logo was perhaps the best clue.

So far, pretty standard. As we passed through duty-free, two of the eight staff I saw were wearing face masks - the first sign something unusual was up. The man trying to sell me a Vodafone tourist sim was also wearing a face mask. Spark staff were mask-free.

Then we arrived in the Customs hall. Surprisingly, there were no queues in either the manual processing lanes or eGates - this was due to our off-peak arrival time.

Now, this is where you can be caught out. Passengers off flights from Australia, United States and Singapore are able to use eGates, which could save 20-30 minutes in peak time according to a staff member I spoke to. But, crucially, you need to keep your boarding pass to prove to a Customs official you were off that flight. Many passengers from our flight had left theirs on the plane, and were forced to head for manual processing.

It took just 27 seconds for me to breeze through Customs (it took more time to set up a timer on my phone).

On the other side of Customs, a desk had been set up in front of a big sign declaring they were "Auckland Regional Public Health Service". Here, sat two women in high visibility vests, positioned in front of dozens of coronavirus pamphlets in different languages.

Off to the side was a little examination cubicle, that had been folded away. These, as it turned out, were the health professionals we needed to consult with if we weren't feeling well. They didn't look busy, but their industrial-sized bottles of hand sanitiser were both 3/4 empty - a sign they were in demand at other times of the day.

Next on to biosecurity, where there were absolutely no queues - and MPI was only concerned about seeing the (declared and washed) hiking shoes in my bag. A quick inspection later, we were out the door. The whole thing - from arrival at the gate to walking free - took 34 minutes, and the most significant delay was waiting for our bags.

In peak times, it's a different story. Customs report some passengers are now taking longer than 45 minutes to process. The best tip I can give is to make sure to hold on to your boarding pass if you're coming from Australia, the United States or Singapore, then you still get to use eGates.

So, it was largely business as usual last night. Not one person asked about coronavirus. In fact, the only person to speak to me about it on my entire trip home was a check-in agent in Hawaii, who asked if I'd been to China in the past 14 days. Our Ministry of Health says that's robust screening. I'll leave it up to you if you agree.
