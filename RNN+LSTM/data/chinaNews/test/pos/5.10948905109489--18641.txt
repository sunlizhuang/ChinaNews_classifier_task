QATAR. Qatar Duty Free has partnered with L’Oréal Travel Retail Europe Middle East Africa and India (TREMEAI) to launch a dazzling Chinese New Year animation from Lancôme at Hamad International Airport.

The pop-up was launched in partnership with Qatar Tourism Council (QNTC) and Qatar Airways. It was officially opened today (22 January) with a Chinese New Year themed launch event, which culminated with a thrilling lion dance performance.

Lancôme’s Chinese New Year pop-up is dressed in festive red and takes centre-stage at Hamad International. It has been described as a ‘magical journey’ and offers an engaging interactive shopping experience that includes traditional Chinese lanterns and an interactive digital screen.

At the pop-up, customers can also purchase a limited-edition red bottle of the Lancôme’s Advanced Génifique Serum, one of the brand’s hero products.

As reported, The Advanced Génifique formula is the culmination of 15 years of microbiome research — and delivers essential resources such as sugars, amino acids, and lipids to help protect, regulate and repair skin.

“Together with this unique experiential podium, we are fully leveraging the power of digital media to have a complete offline and online experience, to maximise the drive-to-store effect within Hamad International Airport” – L’Oréal TREMEAI General Manager Gianguido Bianco

The eye-catching animation is part of the Shop Qatar Festival, which will run across various shopping malls in Doha until 31 January. The festival has launched a week-long series of activations during its penultimate week, kicking off with the official launch of Lancôme’s Lunar New Year pop-up.

As part of Shop Qatar’s Chinese New Year celebrations, Qatar Duty Free is also offering a -20% discount for purchases of US$200 or more. In addition to this, customers can also receive free flash makeup sessions and exclusive gifts via Qatar Duty Free’s lucky ‘red envelopes.’

The festive launch event was attended by representatives from Qatar Duty Free, Qatar Airways, L’Oréal Travel Retail, and Hamad International Airport. Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive and QNTC Secretary General, His Excellency Akbar Al Baker; Hamad International Airport Chief Operating Officer Engineer Badr Mohammed Al Meer; Qatar Duty Free Vice President Operations Thabet Musleh; and L’Oréal Travel Retail Middle East India General Manager Sebastien Colon were some of the event’s VIP attendees.
