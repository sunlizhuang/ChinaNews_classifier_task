CAIRO: The Great Pyramids and the Sphinx in Giza near the Egyptian capital Cairo have been shining in red in a ceremonial sound and light show on Thursday evening as part of the celebrations of China’s Spring Festival, also known as the Chinese New Year.

During the show, the Sphinx was lit in vivid colors while narrating the stories of ancient Egyptian pharaohs with laser shapes projected on the three massive pyramids in the background.

Attended by hundreds of Chinese visitors, along with many Egyptians who are interested in the Chinese culture, the event was organized by the Chinese Cultural Center in Cairo (CCC) in cooperation with Misr Company for Sound and Light.





“Today, the Pyramids Plateau is distinguished by wonderful lights as the Chinese red lanterns integrate with the beautiful Egyptian pyramids, marking a meeting between the two old civilizations of China and Egypt,” Shi Yuewen, cultural counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Egypt and CCC chief, told the attendees.

Shi noted that the outgoing 2019 witnessed “great success” in the rising cultural and tourism exchange and growing ties of friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

The Chinese diplomat stood in the middle of a row of Chinese and Egyptian visitors who together yelled out “Happy Chinese New Year!”

The Egyptian-Chinese cultural interaction has noticeably been growing thanks to the support of the political leaderships of both countries, Fathy Abdel-Wahab, head of the Cultural Development Fund of Egypt’s Ministry of Culture, said during the event.

“Over the past few years, interaction between the Egyptian and the Chinese has become stronger and we started to see more Chinese people in the Egyptian streets,” the Egyptian official told Xinhua.
