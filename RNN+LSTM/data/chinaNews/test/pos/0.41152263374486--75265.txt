Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has opened the door for Odion Ighalo to turn his short-term loan deal into a permanent move.

The former Nigeria international joined the Red Devils on a six-month loan deal on deadline day from Shanghai Shenhua.

“It’s a loan, but when you’re in the door and if you impress it gives you a chance,” Solskjaer told Manchester Evening News.

“That’s exactly the same for everyone who signs if it’s permanent or it’s a loan. If you impress as a player, if you impress as a person, if you can help this group improve, then, of course, there’s a chance that we’ll look at extending things.

“That doesn’t just go for Odion, but since you asked, yes, of course his incentive is to play as well as he can.

And it’s up to us to make sure that he’d want to stay if we wanted him.

“I think he’s probably pinching himself at times because he’s now at his favourite club at the age of 30.

“Hopefully he’ll prove to you what I think he will. He’s a proven goalscorer, so he’ll do all right.”
