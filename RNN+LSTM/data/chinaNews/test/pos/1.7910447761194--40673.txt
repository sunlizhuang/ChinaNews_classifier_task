POTSDAM -- Madeline Derouchie of Brasher Falls and Chase McLaughlin of Canton joined a group of 15 other music business students from SUNY Potsdam's Crane School of Music recently in Anaheim, Calif., at the 2020 National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) Show.

NAMM is the world's leading trade event for music products, and the students took advantage of opportunities to network and complete internships there, said a press release from the Crane School of Music.

The Crane students were placed with acclaimed international music industry companies, including brands such as D'Addario, Buffet Crampon, Samson Technologies, Sennheiser and Yamaha, during the annual NAMM Show, held from Jan. 16 to 19. Derouchie interned with Alfred Music and McLaughlin interned with D'Addario.

Numerous Crane alumni work with these firms, and in many cases hold leadership roles. Likewise, many graduates have been recruited following their NAMM Show experiences, the press release said.

The Crane student interns helped set up their booths, familiarize trade visitors with the latest developments in technology, and answered complex questions on product details.

Joined by Crane School of Music faculty, the students were able to work directly with leading firms, thanks to a unique and much-envied internship program originally established by the Crane Institute for Music Business in 2005.

The NAMM Show is the world's leading trade event for the music products industry. The show gathered 115,000 members of the music product industry from 120 countries around the world, to preview new products from 7,000 brands representing 2,000 member companies across every category.

The Crane School of Music hosted an alumni reception during the NAMM Show for alumni and friends of the College on Jan. 18. More than 20 people attended the reception, hosted by Scott Goodman '79, CEO of Zoom North America, who had earlier given a donation to name an office at Crane in honor of SUNY Distinguished Teaching Professor James Petercsak. Crane Dean Dr. Michael Sitton spoke at the event, providing updates on the School and its growing facilities and programs.
