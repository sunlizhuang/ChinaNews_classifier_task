BIG JUMP IN VIRUS CASES, SMALL UPTICK IN FEAR (0935 GMT)

China reported a sharp rise in new coronavirus deaths and infections, as it changed the method of counting virus cases.

Does that matter?

Surely it does, but as UBS GWM's chief economist Paul Donovan points out "Reporting reality more accurately only matters economically if it changes fear levels".

And judging from volatility, the market's fear gauge, it looks like no game changer.

The euro STOXX volatility index in fact is up just 0.7 at 13.18 - sill well below this month's peak.
