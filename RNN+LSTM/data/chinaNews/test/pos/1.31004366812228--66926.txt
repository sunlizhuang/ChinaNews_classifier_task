In a speech delivered to the school online, the school dean expressed his respect for people on the frontline of the fight against the coronavirus, called on the students to learn from them, and gave the city words of encouragement.

The first class at Guanggu No.1 Primary School started at 9 a.m., with four classes arranged for each day. Zhang Xuan, a student at the school, attended a PE class under his mother’s supervision.

On Feb.10, about 426 public classes were organized in Wuhan, which were attended by more than 1 million students through such channels as the city’s education cloud platform, education applications and TV live broadcasts.

To ensure normal teaching and that students’ visual health is protected, the education authorities of Wuhan have taken multiple measures such as setting restrictions on times for daily online teaching, extending breaks, and organizing eye exercises for students on a regular basis.

Wuhan education authorities said the next step will involve improving technologies that support online teaching, and vowed to do their best to ensure that students in rural areas have equal access to online education.
