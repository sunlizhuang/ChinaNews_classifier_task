Republicans win special elections in CT, KY and PA

Posted on by TexasGurl24

Republican Brian Farnen wins House special election in Fairfield by 82 votes. Hold for Republicans.

The Democrat (Leeper) was favored to win here. This area trended to the left very, very fast. (Think yuppie limousine liberal area.) Yet the GOP held on.

Unofficial results from 38th district special election to replace retired Sen. Dan Seum: Mike Nemes (R)8,637 Andrew Bailey (D)4,943

This was an easy hold for the GOP.

There is another Special election in CT and another in PA today as well. I'll post those results when I get them.

82 votes is not enough to win against a Democrat

82 votes is a statistically significant margin in a local special election.



To: AppyPappy

Different from 2018 when the mo was with the Democrats. Its not with them this year.

HD-48. It’s held by a Democrat.

The GOP appears to have won the 48th Senate District in Pennsylvania by a large margin. The votes from Dauphin County are in, and the Republican is winning by 19 points even there. All of Lebanon County is still out, and it’s should go massively for the GOP.

The Dems will probably find 100 votes in the trunk of someone’s car.



To: AppyPappy

Each candidate got less than 2500 votes so 82 might win it. State rep race.



To: Liz

Darn good news.
