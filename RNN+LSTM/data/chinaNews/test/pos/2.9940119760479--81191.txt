In Central, Hong Kong’s two primary gallery buildings—H Queens and the Pedder Building—are open, though some of the larger galleries, including David Zwirner and Hauser & Wirth are not. However, in H Queens, Tang Contemporary is carrying on, and even opened a new exhibition of Feng Yan’s photographic works that find abstraction in natural materials and details of other artworks. Over at the Pedder Building, Hanart TZ Gallery has the most discussed exhibition of the year so far, “Swampland,” by Hong Kong artist Ho Sin Tung, whose new works, both drawings and installations, tap into the sensations of heartbreak, repulsion, and disgust in really unlikely forms (you’ll never see candy again the same way). Lehmann Maupin is showing Los Angeles-based Helen Pashgian’s sculptures toying with light, space, and perception. Knock on the door at Simon Lee to see Mai Thu-Perret’s tapestries and ceramics based on the artist’s fictional narrative imagining a women-only commune, The Crystal Frontier, in “News from Nowhere.” At Ben Brown Fine Arts, you must stop in to see the exuberant self-portraits of Tseng Kwong Chi, who traveled the world as a self-proclaimed “ambiguous ambassador” to take pictures of himself in a Mao suit and sunglasses in front of iconic locales. And Massimo de Carlo, right next door, is showing a selection of John Armleder’s glittery “Pour Paintings” alongside other works in a mini-survey of the Swiss artist, in “Clown’s Way.”

Elsewhere around Central, Alisan Fine Arts has a group show of five artists from greater China who were Asian Cultural Council Fellows, including the iconic Hong Kong ink painter Wucius Wong, and Mao Xuhui, co-founder of the 1980s era Southwestern Art Research Group whose works capture the rustic life in Yunnan province. Crystal Liu’s very serene and pretty panoramas at Galerie du Monde, on Duddell Street, marry the compositions of classical Chinese landscape painting with mother-of-pearl, floral motifs. Up toward the Mid-Levels, 10 Chancery Lane is presenting Liang Hao’s enigmatic paintings that are like visual riddles, exploring the nature of time and subconsciousness, in “Unfolding into the Expanse.”

Toward Soho and Sheung Wan, several galleries have interesting solo presentations. Leo Gallery is showing Yan Bo’s free-form wall sculptures made with mineral pigments. Over the Influence is showcasing Peter Shire’s Los Angeles-inspired, vibrant and quirky abstract paintings and sculptures in “Silhouettes, Souffles & Succotash.” Contemporary by Angela Li is presenting “The Lost Time Travel Machine,” Angela Yuen’s whimsical assemblages of nostalgic objects that cast shadows in the shapes of Hong Kong’s skyline. Next week Soluna Fine Arts is opening a group show of Korean artists called “Obangsaek,” in reference to the five traditional colors of Korean Buddhism.
