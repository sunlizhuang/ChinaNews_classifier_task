Due to the impact of extreme weather, the production of fresh pears in China last season was very limited, resulting in a severe shortage in supply. It is, however, different this season. Thanks to stable weather conditions, production has returned to normal, increasing significantly from the previous season.

At present, sales are mediocre and movement is rather slow, whether it is exports or domestic sales. There are two reasons for this. On the one hand, it is due to price increases, and on the other hand, it is due to citrus flooding into the market.

Mr. Zhao Xiaolei from Hebei Tianbo Fruit talked about the fresh pear market over the past weeks. “Apples are also facing heavy sales pressure, influencing the sales of other fruits. In general, the Spring Festival will not have too much impact on sales. It is a Chinese holiday, and Southeast Asians of Chinese ethnicity prefer citrus and fragrant pears to celebrate this holiday, so it has little effect on ya pears and crown pears. Instead, sales increase during Christmas and Eid al-Fitr in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Bangladesh."







At present, Chinese pears processed by certain factories are allowed to be exported to Brazil, but it still needs some time and a lot of promotion for Brazilian consumers to get to know Chinese pears. A major importer of pears, Brazil traditionally imports pears from Chile. Therefore, Tianbo Fruit also wants to export more Chinese pears to Brazil.

“As Brazil is far from China, transportation must be arranged properly. Otherwise, many issues may occur during transport,” Mr. Zhao Xiaolei said. "Transportation and logistics are now very mature, so they are not a problem, but China and Brazil have bilateral agreements, which means that very stringent quarantine requirements are in place. Therefore, when we export to Brazil, we need to be extremely careful to ensure that our entire trade process meets all regulations. "





Except for the Brazilian market, other markets are still closed to Chinese pears. Since last year, Russia has stopped importing fresh pears from China. "Russia has not yet reopened the pear market to China. They also banned the import of Chinese citrus in January. So far there is no further news, and we will have wait and see how it will develop,” Zhao Xiaolei said.









The company will take part in Fruit Logistica in Berlin to further expand its activities in overseas markets. All visitors are welcome to their stand at Stand D-04b in Hall 26.
