BOT assistant governor for banknote management, Somboon Chitphentom, said on Friday (January 17) that commercial banks were estimated to disburse more banknotes worth Bt38 billion during Chinese New Year at the end of this month.

“During the festival period, people’s demand for banknotes will increase,” he explained.

BOT has reserved enough banknotes to meet the demand and had also collaborated with commercial banks to facilitate banknote distribution.
