Luo Huining, the new director of Beijing’s Liaison Office in Hong Kong, praised Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor for her leadership amid the months-long social unrest in the city during a meeting at the Government House on Thursday afternoon.

Luo told Lam that he admired her courage and sense of responsibility to end the violence and stabilize the situation, as well as the measures she took to help businesses and residents ease their hardships, the Beijing Liaison Office said in a statement issued after the meeting that lasted one and a half hours, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reports.

Luo, who took office on Monday, also told Lam that the Beijing Liaison Office will continue to fully respect and support the chief executive and the Hong Kong SAR government to govern in accordance with the law, Xinhua News Agency said, citing the statement.

In a separate press release issued on Thursday night, the government said Lam expressed at the meeting that during Luo’s visit to Hong Kong at the end of 2018 in his capacity as Communist Party secretary of Shanxi province, they had very good exchanges and she was impressed by his care for Hong Kong.

Lam also described Luo as a person who is familiar with the situation in Hong Kong, even though he has just taken up the post.

She expressed the hope that communication and co-operation between them would be enhanced down the road to promote various areas of work involving the mainland and Hong Kong.

Lam also briefed Luo on the work of the HKSAR government in various aspects over the past two years as well as the social unrest arising from the now-withdrawn extradition bill.

According to the government press release, both Lam and Luo believe Hong Kong has experienced the most challenging situation since its return to the motherland over the past seven months, affecting seriously all aspects of society, and that restoring social order as soon as possible is the common aspiration of the general public.

They also expressed confidence that under the long-standing and strong support of the central government, Hong Kong will be able to relaunch itself and open a new page, as well as better integrate into the overall development of the nation and achieve long-term prosperity and stability.

Lam reiterated in the meeting that the government will, in accordance with the Basic Law and the “one country, two systems” principle, spare no effort to curb violence and uphold the rule of law in order to find a way out of the current impasse.

Meanwhile, Wang Zhimin, Luo’s predecessor, has been appointed as vice president of the Institute of Party History and Literature of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, according to the institute’s website.

Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said that since Wang is already 62 years old and only three years away from retirement, it is expected that he will keep the post until his retirement.

Also on Thursday, Luo met with former first chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, who is vice-chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, China’s top political advisory body.

According to the liaison office, the two exchanged ideas on issues such as Hong Kong’s current situation and the city’s deep-rooted problems.

Luo said Tung’s utmost efforts for the development and advancement of the nation and Hong Kong since he became vice-chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference are praiseworthy.

He also said he hoped that Tung would continue playing a proactive role in sustaining Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability.

Tung congratulated Luo on his new post.
