New Delhi: Maldives is India’s ally and is on the same page with New Delhi regarding peace and stability in the Indian Ocean Region, the country’s foreign minister Abdullah Shahid said.“Peace and stability in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) contribute to stability in Maldives. And stability in Maldives contributes to stability in the IOR. We are on the same page with India with regard to peace and stability in IOR,” Shahid told ET in an exclusive interview.On withdrawal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir , he said: “We believe that it was purely an internal matter...which was conducted within the purview of the Indian Constitution. No outside power should have any role in this process.” Maldives was the first country to support India’s decision on Article 370.The minister was in Delhi to attend India’s flagship multilateral conference on foreign policy, Raisina Dialogue , organised by the Ministry of External Affairs in collaboration with the Observer Research Foundation, a policy think tank.Without specifically referring to China, Shahid said Male does not favour big-power rivalry in the region. The country is facing other challenges as well, the minister said while pointing to last year’s Easter Sunday terror attacks in Sri Lanka.“I visited Colombo after the attacks last year. We have to be cautious against drug-trafficking and rise of extremism in the region. Terror knows no religion. It is a pure evil,” he said.Maldives supports the revival of National Security Advisor-level dialogues with India and Sri Lanka as a way to address security challenges in the region, he added.“We have excellent intelligencesharing cooperation with India to counter challenges,” he said.This was Shahid’s second visit in as many months, underscoring Maldives’ growing strategic partnership with India since the election of Ibu Solih as its President in 2018. “We have outstanding ties with India. Delhi has extended financial assistance for various projects over the past year and Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Maldives first after his reelection,” he said. “On my return to Male, I will conclude three tourism-related pacts with India.”When asked about the achievements of the Solih government, Shahid said Maldives had reclaimed democracy, peace and happiness over the last 14 months.“There is overwhelming support for stability in Maldives. Today, we have, for the first time, two women as judges in the Supreme Court of Maldives, which is a landmark development,” he said.
