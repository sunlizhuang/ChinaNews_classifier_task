KUALA LUMPUR: The "Muafakat Nasional" or national cooperation between Umno and PAS is in its second phase, says Umno deputy president Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan (pic).

"The 'Muafakat Nasional' between Umno and PAS is a done deal and we are now at the second phase.

"This is the phase where we are open to opportunities to work with anyone who wants to see a more effective and stronger opposition bloc," he told reporters after attending MCA Chinese Lunar New Year Open House celebration at Wisma MCA.

Mohamad noted that the main goal of the cooperation is to see the Oppositon coming to power after the 15th General Election.

When met, PAS secretary-general Datuk Takiyuddin Hassan said he attended the open house celebration as part of the opposition bloc which also includes MCA and MIC.

He said that PAS viewed its cooperation with Umno to extend to other parties under Barisan Nasional.

"Along with MCA and MIC, we are all in the opposition bloc and we are together in Parliament and outside Parliament.

"So it is highly probable that we will be together as a team in GE15," Takiyuddin said.

Takiyuddin said that based on its history, he said PAS had cooperated with other parties from both sides of the divide including Umno, DAP and PKR and it was not impossible for PAS to cooperate with any other parties in the future.

Umno is the largest opposition bloc in Dewan Rakyat with 38 MPs while PAS has 18 MPs in the 222-seat House.

Last September, Umno and PAS inked a political cooperation with the signing of a joint charter.

Meanwhile, MCA president Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong said that Barisan's cooperation extended to other parties although no formal agreement may have been inked.

He said such cooperation could be on an ad hoc basis covering specific issues where all parties share the same common goal.

Dr Wee cited the recent Kimanis parliamentary by-election as an example where Parti Bersatu Sabah had assisted Barisan in its win in Jan 18 although not under the Barisan banner.
