WASHINGTON, D.C. (KELO.com) -- Governor Kristi Noem says the trade deal with China signed by President Trump is an incredible economic victory for South Dakota producers.

Noem was at the White House ceremony on Wednesday.

"This historic deal opens up new markets and advances opportunities for farmers and ranchers to do what they do best: feed the world.”

Also at the ceremony was Senator Mike Rounds. He says phase one will provide much-needed relief for South Dakota producers, who have been on the "tip of the spear."

The signing ceremony was packed with many South Dakotans, including State Farm Bureau President Scott VanderWal.

"What they're telling us is about 40 billion dollars worth of ag products will be going to China over two years."

Among the White House crowd was Jerry Schmitz, Executive Director of South Dakota Soybeans.

"“The pioneer spirit lives on in South Dakota agriculture, and today’s agreement could very well be the new horizon we need to extend our operations...."

South Dakota Congressman Dusty Johnson is also praising the phase one deal, calling it a step in the right direction.

"Producers want certainty and China needs to play fair - this agreement hits the mark on both fronts."
