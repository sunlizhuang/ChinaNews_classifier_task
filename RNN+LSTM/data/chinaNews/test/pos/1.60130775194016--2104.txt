Kathmandu, Jan 7 (PTI) Nepal and China on Tuesday agreed to enhance cooperation and communication between their law enforcement agencies for maintaining peace and security across the border, the foreign ministry said here on Tuesday.

Nepal and China share 1,414-kilometre border along the Himalayas, extending northwest-southeast direction and separating the south of Tibet Autonomous Region of China and the territory of Nepal. This border passes through the highest peak in the world, Mount Everest.

Nepal's Minister of Home Affairs Ram Bahadur Thapa held delegation-level talks with China's State Councillor and Minister of Public Security Zhao Kezhi in Beijing on Tuesday.

They discussed issues of mutual interest, including the promotion of bilateral cooperation in public security, cross border crime, capacity building and border management, the foreign ministry in Kathmandu said in a statement.

'Both the leaders agreed to enhance cooperation and communication between law enforcement agencies of the two countries for maintaining peace and security across the border,' it said.

The two officials reaffirmed their commitment to enhancing mutually beneficial cooperation as agreed by the leaders of the two countries during the exchange of presidential visits in 2019, the statement said.

Minister Thapa assured the Chinese side that Nepal was steadfast in its one-China policy and would not allow any anti-China activities in its territory.

Thapa arrived in Beijing for a six-day official visit to China on Sunday. He is scheduled to visit Shanghai and Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region and meet with senior officials.

He also thanked China for its continued support towards Nepal's socio-economic development, including in the areas of security cooperation, human resource development and disaster relief and management.

Zhao expressed confidence that Nepal and China would continue to work together to promote peace, security and development.

China has been investing heavily in Nepal in the last few years to enhance the connectivity and infrastructure.

The two countries signed eight agreements in 2018 for developing major infrastructure projects in the land-locked Himalayan nation to further deepen bilateral ties. PTI SBP MRJ MRJ
