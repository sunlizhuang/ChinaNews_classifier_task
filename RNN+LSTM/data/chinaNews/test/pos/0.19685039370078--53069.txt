Salem State University’s dean of students recently sent a campus-wide email detailing the counseling and health services’ efforts to monitor and prevent the flu on and “a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).”

That dean, Carla Panzella, sent the alert on Monday, Jan. 27. On that day, the United States had five confirmed coronavirus cases – a number that has since climbed to 11, including one in the Bay State.

Panzella said symptoms that accompany coronavirus diagnosis include “fever and…lower respiratory illness such as coughing and difficulty breathing.”

Panzella instructed students who traveled from Central China in the past two weeks and have these symptoms to “contact health services immediately” during office hours or to visit a “local hospital or urgent care center.”

On campus, Counseling and Health Services office hours are Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Halting travel to China

The same day that Panzella sent her campus-wide email, Salem State University President John Keenan announced university travel to China will be “halted until further notice.”

Keenan advised students with official university travel plans to China to contact the Center for International Education. Both Panzella and Keenan’s emails noted the university is monitoring the coronavirus spread via the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

“The [coronavirus’] risk to the Salem Sate community is very low,” said Counseling and Health Services Associate Director Kalei Ensminge.

While the risk may be low, Ensminger went on to say the university takes the public health situation seriously.

Seasonal flu risk higher

Ensminge said coronavirus cases are nowhere near Salem, but she said the risk of seasonal flu spreading among students, faculty and staff remains much higher than coronavirus.

Students with the flu are advised not to attend class, Ensminger said. Resident students who have the flu are also advised by her to go home if possible, and if they cannot, they are encouraged to work with both Residential Life and their roommate or roommates to isolate themselves.

Ensminger advises leaders within the high education institution from professors to deans alter attendance policies or offer alternative assignments for students with the flu.

Ensminger encouraged professors not require notes from doctors from their students because most “healthy, young people” whose symptoms are “mild or moderate” can “stay home and do symptomatic care,” such as resting and drinking fluids.

According to Ensminger, people with a viral illness who have pre-existing medical conditions are more likely to become sick, and they should “absolutely access healthcare services.”

For those who seek more information on flu and virus prevention, Ensminger recommends the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s website for its resources and “wealth of information,” and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health’s website.
