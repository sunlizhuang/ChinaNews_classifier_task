NORTH CANTON For nearly a century, the North Canton Police Department has been keeping the city safe.

Tuesday, the department celebrated its centennial with proclamations, new street banners and a plaque commemorating the department’s chiefs.

The event honored the city’s current police offers along with retirees.

"This is an opportunity that we’ll be able to share forever," said Mayor Stephan Wilder, a former police chief in North Canton.

North Canton, then New Berlin, was founded in 1831.

For the first several decades, Plain Township marshals served as city law enforcement. When New Berlin was incorporated in 1905 it hired its first village marshal, Manias Reiter.

By 1920, the village had a new name and a growing population. On Aug. 1, city council passed ordinance 466 allowing the village to appoint a police officer. On Oct. 18, J.A. LeBeau was named North Canton’s first police officer.

In 1922, the village did away with the village marshal position and S.J. Kurtzman was named North Canton’s first police chief, overseeing a department of two. The city has had 10 police chiefs in its history.

Now, the North Canton Police Department has 18 officers headed by Chief John Minock.

"It’s very humbling and overwhelming to be part of this organization being recognized at this point in time," Minock said.

"I just can’t say enough about how good it makes me feel looking back at some of the people that I’ve worked with in the past. And to think that some of you will be here as part of the next 100 years. It just can’t be described," he added.

The Ohio Senate, Ohio House of Representatives, the Ohio Attorney General’s Office and the North Canton mayor’s office issued proclamations for the occasion.

State Rep. Scott Oelslager thanked all first responders for "doing the Lord’s work."

"We’re all blessed in this community that we have people out there risking their lives everyday," he said.

He recounted a time when, while leaving the Statehouse in Columbus, he witnessed a police officer confront a man running with a gun in his hand.

"Thank God for the men and women who wear the badges and go out of their way to protect us," he said.

Sgt. Matthew Buzzard organized Tuesday’s event and has taken the lead on the centennial project.

He invited current and former police officers to stand and then held up a challenge coin designed to honor the centennial. The department is distributing them throughout the community this year.

"While it’s physically made of 3 millimeters of brass, some hard-fire enamel, a little bit of gold plating. It’s actually been created over the past 100 years by the people you see standing here today," he said.

People will often comment that it must be nice to work in a safe city like North Canton, he said.

"Sometimes you have to remind them that it is so safe and a nice place to work because of the work we do," he said.
