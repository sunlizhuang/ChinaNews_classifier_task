SO here it is – Brexit day.

After one referendum, two General Elections and five attempts to pass the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons, Britain will leave the European Union at 11pm today.

It is the third date that has been pencilled in the diary for Brexit after two false starts on March 29 and October 31 last year.

But will Warrington notice anything different once Britain leaves the EU tonight?

Philip Cox is chief executive of 871 Cheshire and Warrington local enterprise partnership (LEP), which supports businesses across Cheshire and Warrington.

“I don’t think Friday is going to bring anything really,” he told the Local Democracy Reporting Service.

“In the run up to March 29 last year, we were being asked to provide a lot of support to businesses by central Government – making sure people understood the implications of a no-deal Brexit.

“We repeated all that again in the run up to October 31 – but we have had none of that this time around.”

When the UK leaves the EU tonight, it will enter what is known as the ‘transition period’, with the nation remaining in Europe’s customs union and single market until December 31.

In that time the UK Government needs to iron out its future relationship with the EU – covering everything from tariffs and trade, to movement of people and regulations.

If the two sides fail to agree on a new deal, Britain could end up trading with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules – the same outcome as there would have been if a ‘no-deal Brexit’ took place last year.

Cheshire is home to a wide variety of businesses – from car manufacturing and chemicals, to baking and banking.

And each of their needs will be different as the UK negotiates with the EU this year.

Mr Cox said: “You will have heard Vauxhall, and its owner Peugeot, being anxious about Brexit – the impact it might have on free trade, the cost of tariffs on cars going to Europe and so on.

“Vauxhall will have one set of objectives, but Bentley is also in our patch. They are part of Volkswagen. They will be worried about tariffs, but a good chunk of their business is in the United States and China, where actually it might be that they could pay more attention.

“So you can see how even two different companies within the same industry have slightly different objectives depending on where they get their components from and where they are exporting to.

“That is true for many Cheshire businesses. There are a large number of businesses that do a lot of trade with companies or supply products in Europe, and there are some that are going to be completely unaffected.”

When Britain voted to leave the EU on June 23, 2016, 52 per cent of voters were won over by claims of a brighter future to come outside of the trading bloc.

So what benefits could Cheshire enjoy – and will we see them sooner or later?

Mr Cox added: “The one thing I would say is that for all businesses, including financial businesses, what they want is clarity and certainty. That was missing in the run up to March 29 and October 31.

“Once they know what they are dealing with, most businesses say they are sufficiently flexible.

“As a Cheshire economy, we have got a larger proportion of exports going to China and the United States than is the case for the rest of the UK. If being out of the EU makes it easier for us to export to those areas then companies doing that are going to benefit quite a bit.

“There is likely to be some sort of tariff between us and the EU. If that happens then there is a strong possibility to get supply chain companies on this side of the Channel – but that really does depend on the terms of the deal that is done.”

For now, it seems life in Brexit Britain will be much the same as before, but all that could change when the clock hits midnight on January 1, 2021.
