Bernardino Regazzoni, Swiss Ambassador to China, expressed his solidarity with the Chinese people suffering under the novel coronavirus outbreak in a video message on February 10.

"In this year, which marks the 70th anniversary of relations between our two countries, I commend the extraordinary efforts put in place by the Chinese Government to fight the virus and the professionalism and commitment of the medical staff on the ground," he said.

Hospital equipment is on its way from Switzerland and will be delivered soon, Regazzoni said. The Swiss Embassy in Beijing confirmed its government is currently working on a shipment of hospital equipment in coordination with the Chinese authorities. Moreover, the country has made a contribution of about $616,000 to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Geneva and in support of the World Health Organization in China and its regional office for the Western Pacific.

In addition, Swiss companies, which play a key role in thriving bilateral relations, have been donating medical supplies and nutritional products in support of local organizations on the frontline. The Swiss pharmaceutical industry is also committed to providing expertise, products and advice to support virus research and patient diagnosis.

"Be resilient," Regazzoni said. "Switzerland is with you."
