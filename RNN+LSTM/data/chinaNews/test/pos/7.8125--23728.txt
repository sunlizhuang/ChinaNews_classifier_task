WITH the merry bangs of firecrackers we bid the past year farewell and, with our hearts full of happiness, we greet the new year. As the Year of the Mouse is ushered in, on behalf of the Embassy of China in Malaysia, I wish all Malaysian people a happy and blissful Chinese New Year!

Chinese New Year is the most jubilant traditional festival of the Chinese people. During this period, Chinese people all over the world return home, reunite with family, pay tribute to ancestors and visit relatives and friends. Chinese people who have been busy working for a long year can now recollect the past in gratefulness and look forward to the future in high hopes. We also send each other our best wishes of good health, good fortune and a good life. Chinese New Year, in a sense, is a manifestation of Chinese cultural values that have been passed on from generation to generation for 5,000 years.



In Malaysia, Chinese New Year festivities are extended to the non-Chinese through the “open house” tradition, an impressive feat showing not only the charm of diversity in harmony in Malaysia but also the special cultural and emotional bond between China and Malaysia. It is on this foundation of traditional friendship that China-Malaysia relations can thrive.

Last year, China commemorated the 45th anniversary of China-Malaysia relations, and our bilateral cooperation has yielded fruitful results on all fronts.

The total trade volume between our two countries reached US$1.24tril (RM5.036tril) in 2019 with a remarkable 14.2% year-to-year growth, creating a new record high. And the number of Chinese tourists visiting Malaysia last year topped three million.

This year will be an eventful one with Visit Malaysia 2020 and the China-Malaysia Year of Culture and Tourism both going on. Last weekend, we witnessed the grand opening ceremony of the China-Malaysia Year of Culture and Tourism 2020 in Kuala Lumpur, and Premier Li Keqiang and Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad sent their congratulatory messages respectively to the ceremony. Throughout the year, both sides will carry out various activities to strengthen cultural and tourism exchanges and cooperation, and further deepen the understanding and friendship between our two peoples.

And in November this year Malaysia will host the Apec (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) Leaders’ Summit that Chinese leaders will surely attend.

In this sense, the year 2020 will be a year of opportunities and achievements for China-Malaysia relations.

In the Chinese lunar calendar, this is the Year of the Mouse. The Mouse, which comes first among Chinese zodiac signs, symbolises good luck, good fortune and good harvests. Thus, the Year of the Mouse will bring all these good implications to all of us.

I wish, in this coming year, that China and Malaysia will work hand-in-hand and accomplish more. I wish China-Malaysia relations will maintain their good momentum and reach ever new heights. Last but not the least, I wish all Malaysian friends good luck in all your endeavours and all the best in the Year of the Mouse.
