The best kind of meals are those that celebrate the best kind of news, and Jaime Stafford did so Jan. 22 at Port Canaveral:

“I found out today my biopsy was benign,” she told fellow members of FLORIDA TODAY’s Facebook group for food lovers, 321 Flavor: Where Brevard Eats. “To celebrate, I went to the port with a friend. We started at Junkanoo (Island Kitchen and Rum Bar, 626 Glen Cheek Dr.) with a well drink and the clams: highly recommend them.

“Then next door to Rusty’s (Seafood & Oyster Bar, 628 Glen Cheek Drive) for another celebratory cocktail and raw oysters: HUGE oyster . . . I slug them down with nothing but their salty juices.

“Then, to cap off the day, we had a late lunch at Rising Tide Tap & Table (523 Glen Cheek Drive): pretzel knot, grilled Caesar with shrimp and white anchovies. My friend had the Luna Tuna. Amazing and a great way to celebrate.”

Other members who raved about restaurants included:

Kelly Stephens (Jan. 27) “Went to Paisley Vegan Kitchen (2447 N. Wickham Road, Melbourne) in Melbourne for lunch yesterday! The food was AMAZING: deviled potatoes, Buffalo mac and cheese and loaded nachos.”

Lloyd Romero (Jan. 25): “Great little place, near Dairy and 192: Jao Thai Kitchen (914 W. New Haven Ave., Melbourne).”

Lourdes Risco (Jan. 23): “(We had) ropa vieja (shredded beef) with moros (rice and black beans mixed) and plantains. Also got some croquettes. The Cuban food here is the best in the county by far. Thank you, Cuban Cafe La Tinaja (3815 U.S. 1, Cocoa).”

Fran Ubertini (Jan. 26): “(I) just came back from Third Culture (Kitchen, 1000 Cheney Hwy., Titusville). Wow! Thanks for opening a great casual place with super-fresh, delicious food and great craft cocktails." (Photo: 321 Flavor/Submitted photo)

Fran Ubertini (Jan. 26): “(I) just came back from Third Culture (Kitchen, 1000 Cheney Hwy., Titusville). Wow! Thanks for opening a great casual place with super-fresh, delicious food and great craft cocktails. (I) came at a busy time but was seated quickly, with extremely friendly service.

“(I) started with an amazing cocktail called Hana Hau (I think) which was created by the nicest bartender-waitress. Yes, that is fresh passionfruit. Yep, everybody chips in to help. Wish I (had gotten) her name; she is great. The cocktail reminded me of my many times on Maui.

“Ordered veggie spring rolls: crispy, fresh and not greasy, thank you, with a sweet chili sauce. By the way, portions are large, like seven or eight rolls, not four, followed by poached egg hollandaise in a bao bun with home fries. I definitely appreciate manager Will, who took the time to chat about New York City. I will definitely work my way through the menu and can’t wait to return.”

Tracy DeSando-LaMonica (Jan. 25): “We ate at La Estancia De Luisa (5279 Babcock St., Palm Bay) last night and it was delicious. We had two bandeja paisa, an order of tostones, (an) arepa, two Argentine pollo empanadas and an apple soda for $42. If you want amazing homemade Colombian food, this is your place.”

Betsy Marvin (Jan. 25): “(We dined at) Tely's, (Chinese restaurant) 6450 N. Wickham Road, Suntree) after watching a dragon celebrating the New Year. (We had) whole fried fish and Hunan lamb.” (Photo: 321 Flavor/Submitted photo)

Kathryn Seifert De Vocht (Jan. 25): “Great lunch yesterday at Cedar’s Café (4100 N. Wickham Road, Melbourne), a Lebanese restaurant. Our choices from the pick-three selection: baba, lentils and rice, falafel: so fresh, favorable, and delicious. We also shared a beef shawarma wrap, also fresh and delicious. Our lunch ended with Turkish coffee, a honey cake and pistachio baklava. (I) couldn’t ask for a better finish for a fabulous lunch. The servers were friendly, knowledgeable, (and) very attentive. We’re looking forward to dinner.”

Anita Cragg (Jan. 26): “(I) just had a wonderful dinner at Fresh Scratch (Bistro and Lounge, 1940 Hwy. A1A, Indian Harbour Beach) in the Lowe's Plaza with my husband and a friend. My friend and I both had the risotto bowl, mine with chicken, and she had tofu. I love risotto and they delivered. My husband had scallops with a light lemon basil sauce, green beans and carrots, and tasty mashed potatoes. All of our meals were great, wonderfully flavorful with a very nice presentation. Our server (Max) was fun, attentive, and a true professional. Looking forward to going back again. Excellent value.”
