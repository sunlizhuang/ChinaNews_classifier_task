Investors and fund managers are optimistic reporting season will continue to show consumer bright spots this week as some of the ASX's biggest companies including Wesfarmers, Crown and BHP reveal their numbers and potential impact from the coronavirus.

The positive sentiment comes as the S&P/ASX 200 nudges near record highs and speciality retailers such as JB Hi-Fi reported stronger than expected numbers last week, despite broader concerns about the retail market.

"It looks like Australians are still spending ... and all of a sudden expectations have turned on a dime," said Lincoln Indicators executive director Elio D'Amato.

Pengana Capital emerging companies portfolio manager Ed Prendergast said retail had not been "universally positive by any stretch" but some brands such as Kathmandu-owned Rip Curl last week revealed better than expected results.
