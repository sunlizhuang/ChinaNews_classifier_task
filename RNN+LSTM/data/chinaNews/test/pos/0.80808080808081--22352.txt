* Soybean market waiting for Chinese sales after trade deal

* Corn, wheat consolidate after demand-fueled rally

* Grain markets await weekly U.S. export data

(Updates with European trading, changes byline/dateline) PARIS/SINGAPORE, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Chicago soybean futures fell on Friday to hold near a six-week low, as a lack of Chinese purchases since last week's trade deal between Washington and Beijing cooled demand sentiment. Corn ticked down after climbing to a three-month high on Thursday, while wheat also eased after rallying to an 1-1/2 year high earlier this week. Both cereal markets have been buoyed by brisk overseas demand, although traders were awaiting weekly U.S. export data at 1330 GMT for a fresh indication. The most-active Chicago Board of Trade soybean contract was down 0.3% at $9.06-1/2 a bushel by 1045 GMT. In the previous session, it had touched its lowest since Dec. 13 at $9.04 a bushel, but held above the key $9 threshold. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has not confirmed agricultural sales to China since the countries signed last week an first-stage trade agreement in which Beijing pledged to increase imports of American farm products. Soybeans are the biggest U.S. crop export to China and the oilseed market has been sensitive to developments in a trade dispute between Washington and Beijing since 2018. "Soybeans are still waiting for confirmation of purchases from China, while Brazilian harvest pressure will soon be felt," consultancy Agritel said of the soybean market. Traders see the Brazilian harvest, which is underway and expected to be record large, providing stiff competition for sales to China, particularly after Beijing turned extensively to Brazil for supplies during its tariff stand-off with Washington. Traders have also been waiting to see if China buys U.S. corn and wheat under the trade agreement, and the USDA's announcement on Thursday that private exporters sold 141,000 tonnes of U.S. corn to unknown destinations fueled more speculation about potential Chinese demand. Corn and wheat prices, however, have already been boosted by signs of healthy demand elsewhere.

CBOT wheat was down 0.6% at $5.77-1/4 a bushel, whilecorn was off 0.4% at $3.92.

The recent rally in wheat, as well as firm corn prices in Brazil, have boosted demand prospects for U.S. corn. "Perhaps now with wheat prices more firmly established at higher levels, the relative feed costs can support higher corn prices," said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural strategy at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The International Grains Council on Thursday raised its forecast for global corn production in the 2019-20 season, driven mainly by upward revisions for China and the United States. The market's focus for corn and soybean production is on South America. Recent rains in Argentina have helped corn and soybean development during summer heat, the Buenos Aires grains exchange said on Thursday.
