Kona Crossroads celebrates Chinese New Year

Kona Crossroads celebrates Chinese New Year from 3 to 5 p.m. Sunday in Kailua-Kona.

Festivities will include a traditional Chinese Lion Dance to celebrate the Year of the Rat. Accompanied by rhythmic drums and percussion, the lion will visit around Kona Crossroads. The lion will be fed donations in red envelopes, known as lai see (lucky money), believed to bring prosperity to the giver throughout the year. Families are welcome to participate in the tradition, which often delights keiki.

Kona Crossroads is located at 75-1027 Henry St.

Library features science author

Scientist Louise Riofrio will be reading from her book, “The Speed of Light,” from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Kailua-Kona Public Library.

Light is a key part of our lives, even before our eyes open at birth. Riofrio is educated in physics and astronomy. While working as a scientist at NASA in Texas, she found that the speed of light is changing. This discovery could affect everything from theories of the universe to the size of cells in our bodies, according to Riofrio, who now resides on the Big Island where she writes books and works for a lunar observatory.

She will be available afterward for questions and to autograph copies of her books.
