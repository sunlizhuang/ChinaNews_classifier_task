Gold prices, overall, have priced in the trade deal phase I," Jateen Trivedi, Sr Research Analyst - Commodity & Currency, LKP Securities told Moneycontrol.

"Gold is likely to trade down as the initial trade deal between the US and China has lifted global economic optimism which has limited gold’s safe-haven demand. Easing tensions in the Middle East may also pressure prices. However, worries about existing tariffs and the unresolved issues in the trade deal are likely to limit major downside.

On the technical side, a range trade inside $1535-1562 levels is initially expected. Breaking any of the sides would suggest a fresh direction to the commodity."
