VACAVILLE — David Draime’s affair with Cambodia started almost 15 years ago when his sister, who was doing humanitarian work there, invited him to visit Cambodia. He was traveling through Thailand at the time.

He has returned several times to visit various temples, photograph them and recreate them in oil, watercolor and pastel, with great detail.

Draime, who teaches art at Vanden High School, is the spotlight artist at the Vacaville Art Gallery’s current exhibit, “Transcend,” which runs through March 7.

“Visions of Angkor” focuses on the places, and many temples, he visited in the country.

There are also portraits of a Buddhist nun and a young woman wearing a series of coils around her neck. The former invited him into the temple where he “prayed in her little space.” He estimated the temple to be at least 1,000 years old.

Draime has not seen the elderly woman with the beautiful smile on any return trips.

He approached the young woman with the neck coils and asked if he could photograph her. She agreed. She later tried on some toy plastic glass frames, with a generous nose. Draime snapped a picture, which is also on display in the gallery.

“I try to be sensitive when I see a face,” he said.

He likes to converse with the subject and get to know them, he said.

There’s also a portrait of ʻAbdu’l-Bahá, who was head of the B’hai faith from 1892 to 1921. Draime has been a member of the faith for almost four decades. Next to it hangs an extract from a tablet by ʻAbdu’l-Bahá, which resonates with Draime’s artwork. It reads:

“I rejoice to hear that thou takest pains with thine art, for in this wonderful new age, art is worship. The more thou strivest to perfect it, the closer wilt thou come to God. What bestowal could be greater than this, that one’s art should be even as the act of worshipping the Lord? That is to say, when thy fingers grasp the paintbrush, it is as if thou wert at prayer in the Temple.”

“These words perfectly express the reasons I do what I do, as well as the feelings I experience when I am at work in my studio,” Draime shared in an email with the Daily Republic. “For me, painting is essentially a spiritual endeavor. That is probably why I am so drawn to revisit the temples of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, and to try to capture the beauty of these ancient expressions of humanity’s striving for transcendence.”

Another portrait, Tak Ykpaiha, reflects another interesting adventure in Draime’s life. He was teaching in Southern California when a colleague from Ukraine invited him to be an international election observer during the Orange Revolution. The revolution followed the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, which was claimed to have been marred by corruption, intimidation and electoral fraud.

Draime even traveled into the Carpathian Mountains as ballots were distributed to those who couldn’t leave their homes to vote.

He said he hopes to travel to China in April and return to Cambodia and Tibet in the summer.

Cambodia is different from his first visit. There weren’t as many tourists in 2006, he said. It feels like in the past 15 years, many more people have discovered the draw of the Angkor Wat temple.

Barb Musial, the gallery’s manager, said Draime’s work is popular.

“His realism is in the vein of the Old Masters,” she said. “He captures the personality of the person. There’s a spiritual depth (to his work).”
