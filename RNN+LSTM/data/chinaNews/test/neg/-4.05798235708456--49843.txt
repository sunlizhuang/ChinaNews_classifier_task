Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that impact the respiratory system and can range from the common cold to more severe illnesses such as SARS and MERS. The viral respiratory illness spreading rapidly in China is a new kind of coronavirus known as 2019-nCoV that scientists have never observed in humans before. The new coronavirus can cause fever, coughing, wheezing and pneumonia. The incubation period is thought to be two weeks.

The State Department has warned Americans to avoid all travel to China. The decision came after the WHO designated the outbreak a global public health emergency.
