(Natural News) The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) has issued an executive order (EO) calling on the United States Northern Command to start preparing for a full-blown pandemic of the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) here on American soil.

According to a service-wide message issued this past week to the Navy and Marine Corp, Defense Secretary Mark Esper has officially approved the EO, which orders commanders to get ready for “widespread outbreaks” of the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19). They’re also reportedly being told to prepare for having to forcibly confine service members “with a history of travel to China.”

Similar to what communist China is doing by implementing medical martial law, the U.S. military under President Donald Trump is implementing what’s known as the Department of Defense Global Campaign plan for Pandemic Influenza and Infectious Diseases 3551-13, which the Military Times describes as “the Pentagon’s blueprint for planning and preparing for widespread dispersion of influenza and previously unknown diseases.”

U.S. Northern Command has indicated that it is now directing the Joint Staff to commence “prudent planning” based on its assigned role to synchronize the department’s various plans for handling a pandemic flu or similar disease. At the same time, it also added that this planning does not necessarily “indicate a greater likelihood of an event developing.”

“As military professionals, planning for a range of contingencies is something we owe the American people,” stated Navy Lieutenant Commander Mike Hatfield in a statement. “We coordinate with other combatant commands to assess potential impacts in the event of a pandemic and we ensure the U.S. military is poised to respond as required.”

“The military profession fosters a culture of planning, and the fact that we are coordinating planning efforts across the geographical combatant commands is consistent with how we prepare to respond, if directed,” he further added.

Is the U.S. military expecting its own Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) outbreaks at its various installations?

According to Marine Corps message MARADMIN 082/20, commanders throughout the U.S. military are being told to review their disease containment plans and take all necessary “preparatory and precautionary actions” to protect all of its service members, installations and ships stations around the globe.

Part of this includes ensuring that all plans for containment procedures are assessed from response to isolation to quarantine to restriction of movement and “community-based intervention,” according to the memo.

The Marine Corps, it further adds, has to be able to “mitigate, respond (to), and recover from the effects (of the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) in order to maintain force readiness.”

All service members and military commanders who have been to China since February 2 are being asked to stay confined to their residences, or if they live in an open barracks or share a bathroom with others to relocate to a temporary lodging facility for 14 days – even though we now know that the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) can incubate for nearly a month as opposed to just two weeks.

“The restricted service members will be assessed daily for fever by medical personnel by phone or in person and wear protective gear if they personally conduct the medical checks, according to the messages,” the Military Times reports. “Should they display symptoms, they must seek medical attention, but call their military treatment facility first to inform them of their travel.”
