Escalating worldwide concerns, Chinese Health Minister Ma Xiaowei said Sunday that people carrying the new coronavirus could infect others even while they do not show any symptoms for as long as 14 days, a period known as incubation. That implies that, unlike SARS, seemingly healthy travelers could have unwittingly infected others.

But international experts, including at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, say they are still seeking to confirm Ma’s statement. Australia’s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, told reporters on Monday that expert panels were not yet convinced that the virus could be spread by people who were still symptom-free.

Some researchers say that even a small degree of porousness in the quarantine effort could have magnified implications for the epidemic’s toll.

In a study published Saturday, Yu Xiaohua, a professor at the University of Göttingen in Germany, concluded that the epidemic cannot be controlled if the quarantine rate of the infectious population falls below 90 percent.

If 90 percent of patients are quarantined, his modeling suggested, the final number of cases might reach 59,000, with 1,500 deaths. But if only half the infected patients are quarantined, the final number of infected people could approach 5 million, with more than 100,000 deaths.

At the same time, experts say they are heartened so far by the low number of reports so far of human-to-human transmission outside of central China.
