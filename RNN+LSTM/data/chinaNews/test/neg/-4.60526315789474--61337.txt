Bloomfield also said on Saturday that he hopes other people returning to New Zealand from China self-isolate for 14 days. Anyone who has travelled to the Hubei province - where Wuhan is located - in the last year should isolate themselves and register with Healthline on 0800 358 5453.

"Registering will help those in self-isolation as much as it helps us - it will mean we can regularly check on people's welfare and wellbeing as well as helping support New Zealand's overall response to novel coronavirus," he said.

"I'm told the uptake from those wishing to register has been strong."

Healthline will provide further details on Sunday.

At least 720 people have died from coronavirus worldwide, with the vast majority of the 34,000 cases detected in China.

There have been no confirmed cases in New Zealand - which has banned individuals coming to Aotearoa from China if they are not citizens or permanent residents. However, two Kiwis have been tested positive for the illness on a cruise ship docked off Japan. They are currently being treated in a Japanese hospital.

The WHO was first informed of cases of the virus in Wuhan on December 31. It was identified as a coronavirus on January 7 and can spread through human-to-human transmission. There is little known about it but has revived fears of the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 which killed almost 800 people.

"Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death," the WHO says.

"Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing."

There is currently no vaccine for the sickness, which is believed to have come from a marketplace in Wuhan. The Chinese city has become a ghost town with thousands of people there contracting the disease and many dying from it.
