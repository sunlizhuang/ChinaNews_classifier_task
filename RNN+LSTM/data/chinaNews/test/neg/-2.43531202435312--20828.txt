George Soros, billionaire and founder of Soros Fund Management LLC, speaks at an event on day three of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, Jan. 23, 2020.

DAVOS, Switzerland â€” Liberal billionaire George Soros took aim at President Donald Trump and China on Thursday at his annual dinner amid the World Economic Forum.

Chinese President Xi Jinping is "trying to exploit Trump's weaknesses," Soros told the gathering. He also accused Xi of using "artificial intelligence to have total control of his people."

And while Soros did not discuss the Democratic presidential primary, in which he has yet to make an endorsement, he said the 2020 election will not just determine the relationship between Trump and Xi, but the "fate of the world."

Soros, the 89-year-old Democratic megadonor who has a net worth of just over $8 billion, made his comments at a private annual dinner set amid a conference known for featuring elite business and political leaders.

Soros' fresh criticism of Trump and the Chinese government under Xi came after the two nations agreed to a so-called phase one trade deal. The agreement calls for China to increase its purchases of U.S. manufacturing, energy and agricultural goods and services by at least $200 billion over two years and includes provisions to root out intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers.

While Trump has said negotiations on a phase two agreement will begin soon, many business executives at the WEF have raised doubts that another agreement will be made over the next year.

He also leveled direct attacks at Trump, saying the president "is a con man and a narcissist, who wants the world to revolve around him."

"When his fantasy of becoming president became a reality," that narcissism dialed up, Soros said. "This has turned his narcissism into a malignant disease."

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.
