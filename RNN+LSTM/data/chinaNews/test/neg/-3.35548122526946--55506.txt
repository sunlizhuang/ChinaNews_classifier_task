Delays in receiving materials from China have pushed off completion of the new Bourne Police Station on Buzzards Bay off until late May.

Charles Noyes, chairman of the Police Facilities Building Committee, told selectmen Feb. 4 that work is 85 percent complete and that $10.8 million of the total $17.6 million project allotment has been spent.

Noyes said the “substantial project completion date” has been moved from February to April. He said there have been delays in basement moisture remediation that resulted before the building was made weather-tight, and supply-chain delays in obtaining some Chinese electronic equipment due to factory shutdowns and transportation issues.

Noyes said equipment delays were not a result of tariffs as much as the ongoing coronavirus threat and Chinese efforts to contain it.

Town Administrator Anthony Schiavi praised the committee for its attention to detail, especially as it relates to change-order conflicts. Bourne police saved the town thousands of dollars on the project through the changes.

“Change orders led to new ways to resolve issues,” Noyes said.

Noyes also praised Highway Department Supt. George Sala and his crews for their site preparation off Armory Road next to the Mass. National Guard Armory. That work also “resulted in significant cost savings,” he said.

When police move from their 1950s Main Street station, two questions arise. What will happen to the current station? And if it is razed, how will the property be used next?
