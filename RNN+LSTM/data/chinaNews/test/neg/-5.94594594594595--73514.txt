Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and charity units in Vietnam have accidentally experienced the fallout of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, local media reported. Victims, who were smuggled to China, are unable to seek aid from the Blue Dragon Children’s Foundation, a Hanoi-based nonprofit that rescues Vietnamese women and children from slavery and human trafficking, said the founder of the organization Michael Brosowski. The suspension of several border gates with China until the end of this month prevented the charity’s mission, he added. Animals Asia, a charity with bear sanctuaries in Hong Kong and Vietnam, is feeling the pinch. The charity is forced to halt rescuing bears in the northern Vinh Phuc province, which has recorded 11 COVID-19 infections out of the total 16 in the country. The epidemic has also caused Saigon Children, a charity based in Ho Chi Minh City that provides vocational education to disadvantaged children, to postpone the opening of new schools and donor visits, which makes it difficult to secure donations, said executive director of the organization Damien Roberts.
