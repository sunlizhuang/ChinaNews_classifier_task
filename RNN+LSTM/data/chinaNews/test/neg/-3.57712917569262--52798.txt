American Airlines on Thursday extended its suspension of flights between Los Angeles and Hong Kong through late March, citing a drop-off in demand.

That is a month longer than planned when it announced the suspension of Hong Kong flights earlier this week.

American and United on Tuesday suspended their flights to Hong Kong through Feb. 20 as U.S. carriers continue to manage the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.

The airlines cited a drop in demand then and said they would monitor the situation to see if additional changes were needed.

American said flights between Los Angeles and Hong Kong are now scheduled to resume March 28. Flights between Dallas and Hong Kong are still scheduled to resume Feb. 21, the airline said.

United said it would cease flying from San Francisco International Airport to Hong Kong through Feb. 20.

Delta Air Lines stopped flying to Hong Kong in 2018.

United, American and Delta, the three U.S. airlines that serve China with nonstop flights, also suspended direct flights to mainland China amid the coronavirus outbreak, and many overseas carriers have done so as well.

The pace of the new viral threat, first reported Dec. 31 from Wuhan, China, is breathtaking: 28,344 cases and 565 deaths as of Thursday. The outbreak, which sees more cases reported by the hour, is so far largely contained to mainland China; only 349 cases have been reported elsewhere, including 12 in the U.S. and just two deaths in Hong Kong and the Philippines.

Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific said Tuesday that it planned to cut its global capacity by 30% in the short term, and 90% on the mainland, Reuters reported.

At least two China-based airlines continue to fly directly from the U.S. to the mainland: China Southern Airlines and Air China. Cathay Pacific also is still operating U.S.-Hong Kong flights.
