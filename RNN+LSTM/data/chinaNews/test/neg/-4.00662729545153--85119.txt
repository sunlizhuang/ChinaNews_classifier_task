There is currently an ongoing outbreak of the SARS-like coronavirus in certain parts of the globe, with 50 confirmed cases of the virus in Thailand.

The World Health Organization says the official name for the disease caused by the new coronavirus is Covid-19.

The Coronavirus has infected more than 113,000 people globally, with the death toll now rising to over 4,000.

Is it safe to travel to Thailand? Here’s everything you need to know about the current travel advice.

What is the coronavirus?

The virus originated in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, but cases have now been confirmed in other parts of China and numerous countries around the globe, including Thailand.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explains that they usually cause “mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, like the common cold. Most people get infected with these viruses at some point in their lives.

“These illnesses usually only last for a short amount of time.”

Symptoms may include:

runny noseheadachecoughsore throatfevera general feeling of being unwell

However, human coronaviruses can sometimes cause lower-respiratory tract illnesses, such as pneumonia, bronchitis or more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

With the virus having been found in China, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and outside of Asia, guidance has been issued regarding safe travel.

When it comes to travelling to Thailand, the FCO has not issued a warning against travel to Thailand relating to the coronavirus outbreak, but Gov.uk has said: "There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus. The virus originated in Wuhan City, Hubei Province but cases have been confirmed in other parts of China and the region, including Thailand. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the local authorities.

"If you’re returning to the UK from Thailand, consult the latest advice from the Department of Health and Social Care on actions you should take if you develop symptoms on your return."

However, previous advice relating to travel to certain areas of Thailand due to safety concerns still stands.

The FCO “advise against all but essential travel to areas within the provinces on the Thailand-Malaysia border, including:

PattaniYalaNarathiwatSouthern Songkhla province. This does not include areas north of and including the A43 road between Hat Yai and Sakom, and areas north-west of and including the train line which runs between Hat Yai and Pedang Besar.”

The FCO also adds: "Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Thailand.

"Bomb and grenade attacks have been indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. You should take care, particularly in public places, follow the advice of the local authorities and monitor local media reports."

The FCO adds: "If you’re visiting Thailand, make sure you research local laws and customs before you travel. Laws and penalties can be different from the UK. Conviction for possession, distribution or manufacture of drugs can lead to the death penalty. See Local laws and customs."

What caused coronavirus?The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December 2019 and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.

What precautions can be taken?

Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly. The NHS also advises to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze; put used tissues in the bin immediately and try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell. Also avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean.

Should I avoid public places?

Most people who feel well can continue to go to work, school and public places and should only stay at home and self isolate if advised by a medical professional or the coronavirus service.

Don’t go to your GP but instead call NHS 111 or look online at the coronavirus service that can tell you if you need medical help and what to do next.
