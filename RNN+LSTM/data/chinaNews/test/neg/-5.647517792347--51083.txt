Health authorities in China announced on Tuesday that coronavirus fatalities had risen to 425 nationwide and that total confirmed cases hit 20,438 as of Monday. The global death toll is now 427, with a fatality reported in Hong Kong on Tuesday morning.

The updated numbers follow 64 new deaths attributable to the illness in the mainland and 3,235 confirmed cases, according to the country’s National Health Commission (NHC).

Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, announced that coronavirus fatalities there had risen to 414 after 64 deaths – another daily record.

As of midnight on Monday, the health commission of Hubei also reported 2,345 new cases of infection. Of those, 1,242 were reported in Wuhan, the province’s capital and where the contagion, also known as 2019-nCoV, was first reported.

Mortality rate drop predicted

The NHC said the national coronavirus mortality rate would drop further as more suitable treatments and medical resources were mobilised in Wuhan.

Jiao Yahui, deputy director of the NHC’s Medical Administration Bureau, said that, as of Monday and based on confirmed cases nationwide, the national fatality rate was 2.1 per cent, with the vast majority of deaths in Hubei province.

The central Chinese province has lost 414 people, or 97 per cent of the mainland death toll. According to Jiao, the mortality rate in the provincial capital Wuhan has reached 4.9 per cent, with 313 deaths so far. The mortality rate for Hubei is 3.1 per cent, the highest of any province in the country.

Jiao said China had taken further measures to bring down the mortality rate in Hubei, especially Wuhan, with another 1,000 beds for critical cases concentrated in hospitals with ICU capabilities and medical teams with relevant experience in handling critical respiratory disease.

“With all these measures, I think the mortality rate in Wuhan will fall further,” Jiao said.

Jiao said that with the exception of Hubei, the average fatality rate was only of 0.16 per cent, with males accounting for two-thirds of the death toll.

More than 80 per cent of those who died were over 60 years old, and over 75 per cent of them had more than one underlying health problem such as diabetes, she said.

Also in Beijing, Li Xingwang, chief infectious diseases expert at Beijing Ditan Hospital, said the coronavirus patients' ages ranged from one-month to more than 90 years old. “The population is generally susceptible to this disease,” Li said.

Stocks recover

China’s financial markets closed up on Tuesday, recovering from losses on Monday, as market panic eased. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index ended the day 1.34 per cent higher after a fall of nearly 8 per cent on Monday.

In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index finished 1.21 per cent higher. The onshore rate of the yuan against the US dollar gained at 6.9900, firmer than Monday’s close of 7.0257.

China’s central bank continued to pump money in the financial system on Tuesday to drive down money market rates and to restore investor confidence, injecting 50 billion yuan (US$7.13 billion) worth of funds, in addition to the massive 1.2 trillion yuan injection on Monday.

Reuters reported that Chinese policymakers were readying measures to stabilise the economy, especially to support industries hit hard by the virus outbreak and vulnerable to job losses. It said the government was debating whether to lower economic growth targets, adding that the central bank was likely to lower key lending rates and cut the reserve requirement ratio for banks. More fiscal spending is also expected.

Arthur Kroeber, founding partner and research head at Gavekal Dragonomics, said China’s economy was likely to suffer heavily in the first quarter before recovering in the rest of year.

He warned that Beijing’s credibility as a trustworthy actor on the world stage would be severely damaged over the longer term.

Foreigners with mainland travel history banned from Taiwan

Taiwan will ban foreigners who have visited or have been living on the mainland over the past 14 days from entering the island, effective Friday due to health concerns amid the coronavirus outbreak, the foreign ministry said on Tuesday.

The ban, however, would not apply to foreigners living in Hong Kong or Macau, the ministry said.
