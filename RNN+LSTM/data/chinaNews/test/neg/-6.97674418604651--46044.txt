The quarantine period is 14 days

Four Azerbaijani students who have returned from China have been placed in quarantine.

These students came from Wuhan, China – the epicenter of the 2019-nCoVC coronavirus – from which more than 200 people have already died and more than 10,000 been infected.

Now the city of Wuhan is closed for entry and exit, but these students left it earlier, on January 23. They will be quarantined for 14 days.
