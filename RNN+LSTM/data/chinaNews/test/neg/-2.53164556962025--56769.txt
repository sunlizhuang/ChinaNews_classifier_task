Belarusian Student Asks Foreign Ministry To Save Her From Coronavirus 6.02.2020, 14:00

The girl has described how she fell into the trap of coronavirus and indifference of Belarusian diplomats.

Nastsia Mikhalchuk, a 21-year-old Brest resident, came to study at Henan University in September. A few months ago, she couldn't even imagine that she would be afraid to go out shopping. The girl has told Belsat.eu how she fell into the trap of coronavirus and indifference of Belarusian diplomats.

"In Belarus, I study at the BSU Faculty of Journalism. I came to Henan University at my own expense through an exchange programme. The province where the university is located is called Henan. It borders the provinces of Shengxi, Anhui, and Hubei [the epicenter of coronavirus]. About 20 people have come here. And when the whole coronavirus thing started, 5 students returned to Belarus," says Nastia.

According to the girl, the rest of the students were confused and shocked. "We do not know what to do. There is no money for expensive air tickets. To take the train to Zhengzhou to get to Beijing is a risk. I've been sitting in the hostel room for weeks. I only go out to the store for groceries. Today an ambulance took two people with a suspicion of coronavirus from this store," - the Belarusian student says.

Nastsia's mother works as a nurse, and her father is now working in Moscow and they have no money for a more or less nonthreatening flight. It costs about $ 700.

"The Belarusian embassy in China told me that they can't take me out. If I was in Hubei Province, "there'd be another conversation." There are several hundred reported cases in Henan. I don't know what to do. We just got dumped here," - the Belarusian says.

Only foreigners live in Nastsia's hostel. Every day students can check the temperature, but not everyone does it.

"Some people just can't be bothered to go down three floors. There's even no such thing in Belarus. The girl, who returned to Minsk from China, was not even checked at the National Airport. She found the medical station herself, but it was closed [the video is in the disposal of the editorial office]," - Nastsia says.

The Belarusian asks Foreign Ministry to help BSU students to evacuate from China.
