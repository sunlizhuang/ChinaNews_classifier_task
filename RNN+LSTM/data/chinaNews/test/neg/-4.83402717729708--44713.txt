BEIJING — China’s death toll from a new virus rose to 304 by early Sunday, and a World Health Organization official said other governments need to prepare for “domestic outbreak control” if the disease spreads in their countries.

Also Sunday, the Philippines reported the first death related to the virus outside of China. The Department of Health said a 44-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, died after being admitted for treatment on Jan. 25.

Beijing criticized Washington’s order barring entry to most foreigners who visited China in the past two weeks, even as Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced similar measures Saturday, following Japan and Singapore.

South Korea and India flew hundreds of their citizens out of Wuhan, the city at the center of an area where some 50 million people are prevented from leaving in a sweeping anti-virus effort. The evacuees went into a two-week quarantine. Indonesia also sent a plane.

At least 24 countries have reported cases since China informed WHO about the new virus in late December. There are eight cases in the U.S.

The number of confirmed cases in China, by far the dominant location of infections, rose to 14,380, surpassing the number in the 2002-03 outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The virus’ rapid spread in two months prompted the World Health Organization on Thursday to declare it a global emergency.

Apple temporarily closes stores in China Apple is temporarily closing its 42 stores in mainland China, one of its largest markets, as a new virus spreads rapidly. The iPhone maker said it is closing stores, corporate offices and contact centers in China until Feb. 9 “out of an abundance of caution and based on the latest advice from leading health experts.” Apple’s online store will remain open. China is the company’s third-biggest market in terms of sales behind the United States and Europe and it is also where most iPhones and other devices are made. CEO Tim Cook told analysts Tuesday that uncertainty surrounding the outbreak is keeping the Cupertino company from offering more specific guidance about its financial performance in the coming months. In a Saturday note, Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives predicted the store closures will have a “negligible” impact on Apple, largely because consumers in mainland China will still be able to buy iPhones and other products through online channels.

That declaration “flipped the switch” from a cautious attitude to recommending governments prepare for the possibility the virus might spread, said the WHO representative in Beijing, Gauden Galea. Most cases reported so far have been people who visited China or their family members.

The agency acted out of concern for poorer countries that might not be equipped to respond, said Galea. Such a declaration calls for a coordinated international response and can bring more money and resources.

WHO said it was especially concerned that some cases abroad involved human-to-human transmission.

On Friday, the United States declared a public health emergency and President Trump signed an order barring entry to foreign nationals who visited China within the last 14 days, which scientists say is the virus’ longest incubation period. The restrictions don’t apply to immediate family of American citizens and permanent residents.

China criticized the U.S. controls and “unfriendly comments” that Beijing was failing to cooperate.

“Just as the WHO recommended against travel restrictions, the U.S. rushed to go in the opposite way. Certainly not a gesture of goodwill,” said foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying.

U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Saturday approved a request from the Department of Health and Human Services for the possible use of military facilities to accommodate 1,000 people who may have to be quarantined upon arrival from overseas due to the virus.

HHS officials requested the use of several facilities capable of housing at least 250 people in individual rooms through Feb. 29.

Americans returning from China will be allowed into the country, but will face screening at select ports of entry and be required to undertake 14 days of self-screening to ensure they don’t pose a health risk. Those returning from Hubei province, the center of the outbreak, will be subject to up to 14 days of mandatory quarantine.

The installations selected by the Defense Department include Travis Air Force Base in Solano County; Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego County; Fort Carson, Colorado; and Lackland Air Force Base, Texas.

Nearly 200 Americans already are quarantined at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County after being evacuated from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province.

The ruling Communist Party postponed the end of the Lunar New Year holiday in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, for an unspecified “appropriate extent” and appealed to people there to stay home.

Another locked-down city in Hubei, Huanggang, on Saturday banned almost all residents from leaving their homes in the most stringent controls imposed yet. The government said only one person from each household would be allowed out to shop for food once every two days.

China’s anti-disease controls started with the Jan. 23 suspension of plane, bus and train links to Wuhan, an industrial center of 11 million people. The lockdown has spread to surrounding cities.

American Airlines, United Airlines, British Airways, Finnair and Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific have canceled or cut back service to mainland China. Vietnam suspended all flights to China. Delta Air Lines said Saturday that it was accelerating plans to suspend its flights between the U.S. and China, with the last flight from China now leaving Sunday.
