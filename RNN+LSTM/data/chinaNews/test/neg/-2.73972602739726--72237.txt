In fact, the tourism impacts on Chinese travel might hit markets in Japan and Thailand the hardest. In fact, more than a billion dollars in revenue is estimated to be at risk in both countries. Meanwhile, Chinese airlines are rushing to refinance their fleets in order to secure liquidity for their businesses during this difficult time.

On Thursday, Vietnam Airlines said it was losing as much as 250 billion dong (US$10.8 million) in revenue every week as a result of flight suspensions. At the end of January, Vietnam’s Civil Aviation Authority banned all flights to and from China. The airline recently announced that it would be putting some of its aircraft up for lease, saying it will be leasing either its Airbus A321s, its Airbus A350-900s and/or its Boeing 787-9/10s.
