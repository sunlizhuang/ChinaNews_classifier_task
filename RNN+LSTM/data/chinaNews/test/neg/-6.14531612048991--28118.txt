More than 2,700 people have been left infected.

China's National Microbiology Data Center on Monday released the first images of the novel coronavirus strain that has now killed 81 people and infected more than 2,700 across China, with cases found in around a dozen countries as far away as France and the United States.



In a sign of the mounting official concern, Premier Li Keqiang visited ground-zero to oversee containment efforts in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people where the disease emerged late last month.



The government has sealed off Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province, effectively trapping tens of millions of people, including thousands of foreigners, in a bid to quarantine the virus that struck amid the Lunar New Year holiday.



The government decided to extend the holiday, initially due to end on January 30, for three days to limit population flows and control the epidemic.



Twenty-four new deaths were confirmed in Hubei on Monday, and the southern island province of Hainan reported its first fatality, bringing the nationwide toll to 81.



More than 700 new infections were confirmed, while the number of suspected cases doubled over 24 hours to nearly 6,000.
