The declaration was made at a press conference Thursday in the United Nations building in Geneva.

WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus said the main reason for the declaration is not what is happening in China but what is happening in other countries.

The concern is that the coronavirus could spread to countries with weaker health systems.

"We don't know what sort of damage this virus could do if it were to spread in a country with a weaker health system. We must act now to help countries prepare for than possibililty. For all of these reasons, I'm declaring a public health emergency of international concern over the global outbreak of novel coronavirus," he said.

China's death toll from the coronavirus is now at 170. Chinese health authorities said there were 7,711 confirmed cases in the country as of January 29.

The WHO said there had been 98 cases in 18 countries outside of China, but no deaths.

There have been eight cases of human-to-human infection - in Germany, Japan, Vietnam and the United States.

Dr. Ghebreyesus described the coronavirus as an unprecedented outbreak that has been met with an unprecedented response.

On Thursday afternoon, Officials of the Jamaica's Ministry of Health were in a meeting to draft a response to the WHO's declaration on the coronavirus outbreak.

Acting Chief Medical Officer Dr. Karen Webster Kerr said the Ministry was not yet in a position to speak in detail on the global emergency.
