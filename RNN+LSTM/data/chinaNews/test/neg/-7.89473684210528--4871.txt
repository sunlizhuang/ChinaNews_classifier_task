Boy George slammed as transphobic after mocking pronouns as a modern form of attention seeking

Singer Boy George has barrelled back into relevancy after saying that use of pronouns is a modern form of attention seeking.

The Culture Club singers tweets quickly became a lightning rod for criticism from LGBT+ circles, with countless trans and gender-diverse folk slamming the star while his words attracted support from gender-critical groups.

Simply specifying your pronouns, whether on a social media bio or to in an email signature, is a small act that helps encourage inclusivity and building solidarity with the trans community.

But George has kicked off the new decade with a take on pronouns labelled transphobic by activists, coming after singer-songwriter Marc Almond faced similar accusations last year. George decried the claims the artist was transphobic as well as ripping into all this PC stuff.

On January 6, George for some reason tweeted: Leave your [pronouns] at the door.

Boy George slammed as transphobic after mocking pronouns as a modern form of attention seeking A person of 30 years ago would be able to comprehend the first two, though not having any idea of the underlying story. The last one would not have any frame of reference at all, even though Boy George was already known.

When you’ve lost Boy George...

Gay men aren’t big on transexuals. If they liked t*ts, they’d consider playing for the other team.



To: Salman

Transgenders talking trash on Boy George when they weren’t even alive while he was gaying it up. They’ve got some balls.

Or...do they? Peach

You gotta give the fag credit on this one. He is right on the money.

I know Boy George is queer, and all that...but I tell you, Culture Club, MTV and President Reagan. The early 80s were a great time to be alive in America. (MTV screwed up when it started going ghetto, and then dropped music videos)



To: Salman

That’s hilarious. (Oh, and he’s actually right).



To: Salman

gosh, when Boy George is marginalized for not being radical enough....I just don’t have the words



To: SIDENET

When youve lost Boy George... Yep. Boy George is too conservative and too normal for today's totalitarian left. That should concern everyone. I know that I'm worried what will happen the next time they seize power.

(MTV screwed up when it started going ghetto, and then dropped music videos) that was due to law changes that rewarded minority ownership of media outlets.

It is the “wedging” of tyrannical fascism.

Sympathy for the trans community is fading fast. They’re a demanding bunch of pains in the asses.

What next? Sinead O’Connor called too ‘Opus Dei?’

I always liked Boy George. He was a good singer and didn’t take himself too seriously. And I liked how he constantly teased George Michael back in the 80s (before Michael came out as gay), hinting that Michael was gay. To be honest, I really don’t care if a man wants to dress as a woman. But he should not use the women’s bathroom and should not get to have people prosecuted for using the “wrong” pronoun.

if you don’t look, and you don’t take the sort of girly ethos of the music to heart too much...and you just listen...one thing is clear. Boy George could really sing. He really could. The dude could sing.
