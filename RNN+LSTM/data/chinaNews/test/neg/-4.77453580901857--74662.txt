Rio is in talks with customers about its production problems and hasn’t ruled out declaring force majeure on some contracts as it did after Cyclone Veronica.

Vale said it would export 7 per cent less iron ore than expected in the first three months of 2020 because of weather and operational delays, and the company is well behind the pace required to meet its full-year target.

Shaw and Partners analyst Peter O’Connor said it was almost fortuitous that the production hits had come at a time of what BHP boss Mike Henry referred to as deferred iron ore and steel demand in China as a result of the coronavirus epidemic.

“It is kind of welcome in that it will keep the market in balance,” he said.

Mr O’Connor said the 62 per cent benchmark price for iron ore, which has been ranging between $US75 a tonne and $U100 a tonne in recent times, should now head towards mid-$US90 a tonne.

UBS halved its prediction of an overall iron ore supply surplus of 15 million tonnes for 2020 in the wake of Rio’s downgrade on Monday night.

UBS head of resources research Glyn Lawcock expects a tightening in the iron ore market depending on what happens with the coronavirus in China and stimulus from Beijing to revive the economy.

“If [demand weakness] is confined to the March quarter and we get stimulus from the Chinese government, then the expectation is there would be very little to no impact on demand for the year as a whole,” he said.

Mr Lawcock said Rio appeared to have learned some lessons from last year on the knock-on effects of cyclone disruption and was taking a more conservative approach on production with the latest downgrade announcement.

Lost production of 7.5 million tonnes, based on the mid-point of revised and previous guidance and current iron ore prices, could cost Rio Tinto more than $US600 million in lost earnings on top of a big repair and clean up bill. However, any sustained iron ore price rise will counter the impact as it did last year.

Cyclone Damien caused infrastructure damage across Rio Tinto's entire Pilbara network, including access roads, electrical and communications infrastructure and worker accommodation. The damage is thought to be relatively minor in most cases but widespread.

Rio's ports at Dampier and Cape Lambert were hit by winds of more than 220 kilometres an hour, the strongest in 50 years of record keeping. The cyclone then crossed the coast and followed Rio's rail line to mines in the western Pilbara, including Brockman, Tom Price and Paraburdoo where the floors of some of the open pits remain underwater.

The rail line has reopened after repair work on wash oust and other damage.

Too early to assess

All mine sites experienced some disruption and will take time to return to normal operations, which will affect shipments from Rio Tinto ports that only reopened last week after the most fierce cyclone to hit the region in years.

Morgan Stanley analysts said while lower production should in theory lead to some earnings downgrades, it was too early to assess the financial impact.

They said the production hit could keep iron ore markets tighter for longer and push prices higher, but on its current price forecasts Rio Tinto faced a $US350 million earnings hit in 2020.

"We calculate that $US1 a tonne iron ore price increase is needed to offset the loss. Our commodities team currently forecasts a market deficit of 31 million tonnes in 2020, using a global demand growth assumption of 1 per cent," the Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.
