MARION (WSIL) -- While there are no reported cases in Illinois, health experts at the Marion VA Medical Center tell us they're prepared and equipped if a suspected case arises.

Michael Kumor the infection control nurse at the Marion VA says having a plan is key when dealing with a new virus.

Kumor says, "We got guidance from the local health department about doing a travel screen and we do a travel screen anyways and it's been updated."

Kumor explains health experts are closely watching the latest outbreak of coronavirus, the latest form of the respiratory illness that originated in China. He says the virus can spread from person to person.

The fatal virus is known to have flu-like symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, headache, and fever, which can last a few days.

Kumor tells me the Marion VA's infection control committee is coming together to work on preventable care.

He says, "Essentially we're looking for those lower respiratory symptoms you know cough, difficulty breathing with a fever and recent travel to China."

Kumor says if a patient has been affected by the virus the department will take immediate action.

"The recommendation gets them into an airborne isolation room and then get the clinical testing like the samples," he adds.

If you have any flu-like symptoms you're should contact your health provider immediately.
