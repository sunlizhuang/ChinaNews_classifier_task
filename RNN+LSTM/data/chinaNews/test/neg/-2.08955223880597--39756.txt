US Sees 7th Confirmed Case, Man Traveled From Wuhan

The seventh case of the new coronavirus has been confirmed in the United States.

This marks the third case of coronavirus in California, but it is the first in Santa Clara County and the Bay area.

Dr. Sara Cody, the health officer for Santa Clara County, told reporters at a news conference that the man affected “had traveled to Wuhan, China, and became ill upon returning home.”

She added, “Since he has been home to the county, he has been self-isolating at home and did not leave home at all except to seek medical care. He was seen in a local clinic and hospital but was never sick enough to be hospitalized.”

“Our preliminary investigation indicates that he came into contact with very few individuals after returning home. We are making sure that anyone that he did come into contact with is being monitored for symptoms and staying at home away from others,” she also said.

Other cases in the United States to-date are: one in Washington state, one in Arizona, and two in Illinois.

NY Health Commissioner Disputes Report of Confirmed Case

New York City Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot challenged a report that said the first case in the city had been confirmed.

“THIS IS NOT ACCURATE. There are still ZERO confirmed cases of novel #coronavirus in NYC,” she said in a statement on Twitter.

The report from the New York Daily News cited an email from a New York Police Department (NYPD) to eight precincts in Queen sent early Friday.

The message, sent at 1:56 a.m., said the neighborhood of Elmhurst had “1 confirmed case” of the illness.

The New York City Fire Department and NYPD joined the Health Department in challenging the report.

There are no confirmed cases on the U.S. eastern seaboard as of yet. There are two cases in Illinois, with the rest in the western part of the country.

Evacuated American Says Chinese City Like a Ghost Town

Wuhan felt joyful as residents prepared for the Lunar New Year but “turned into chaos” as news broke of the rapidly expanding coronavirus outbreak, American Jarred Evans said. People suddenly swarmed pharmacies and stores to get masks and disinfectant spray, Evans said.

“I stocked up on rice, noodles, water, anything that could help me survive for a week or two,” Evans said.

The Chinese government shut down the city. Buses, trains, taxis, and personal cars were banned. The military patrolled some streets.

“That’s when people, honestly, stayed locked in their homes,” Evans said.

Human-to-Human Transmission Occurred in Early Stages of Outbreak

Human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus was occurring from mid-December 2019 in Wuhan, China, according to the largest study to-date analyzing patients infected with the deadly virus.

A new paper, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Jan. 29, examined data from the first 425 confirmed cases in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, and found that “there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.”

Chinese authorities did not confirm human-to-human transmission until Jan. 20, almost three weeks after the disease was first officially reported on Dec. 31, 2019. The first patient exhibited symptoms on Dec. 1.
