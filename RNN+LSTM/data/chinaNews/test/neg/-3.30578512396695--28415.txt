The U.S. Department of Commerce has announced the affirmative final determinations in the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) investigations of imports of fabricated structural steel (FSS) from Canada (AD only), China, and Mexico, and a negative final determination in the CVD investigation of FSS from Canada.

Commerce determined that producers and exporters from Canada, China, and Mexico have sold FSS at less than fair value in the U.S at rates of 0 to 6.70%, 61.71% to 154.14%, and 0 to 30.58%, respectively.

In addition, Commerce determined that producers and exporters from China and Mexico received countervailable subsidies at rates of 27.34 to 206.49% and 0.01 to 68.87%, respectively.

Because Commerce reached a negative CVD determination with respect to producers and exporters from Canada, this investigation is terminated and no CVDs will be collected on imports from Canada.

In 2018 imports of FSS from Canada, China, and Mexico were valued at an estimated $722.5 million, $897.5 million, and $622.4 million, respectively.

The petitioner is the American Institute of Steel Construction Full Member Subgroup (Chicago).

The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) is scheduled to make its final injury determinations around March 9, 2020. If the ITC makes affirmative final injury determinations, Commerce will issue AD and CVD orders. If the ITC makes negative final determinations of injury, the investigations will be terminated, and no orders will be issued.
