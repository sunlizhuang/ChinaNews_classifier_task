Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, along with 12 other USA airports and the border crossings in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego, have been designated to screen passengers arriving from China for the Wuhan coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced Tuesday.

The European Union will fly its citizens out aboard two French planes this week, and South Korea was due to do the same.

All the USA cases originated in China and public-health officials say there is no evidence the virus is circulating in Washington state or in the U.S.

The plane's ultimate destination is Ontario, California, according to the U.S. Embassy in China.

Australia will help some citizens leave Hubei, and quarantine them on Christmas Island, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday following a briefing by the Chinese government.

When it comes to the Wuhan coronavirus, there are more rumours spreading in British Columbia than suspected infections.

The CDC states that symptoms from the coronavirus "may appear in as few as (two) days or as long as 14 after exposure".

New cases were reported around the world including Germany, where four people from the same company were infected after one of them contracted it from a colleague while visiting their workplace in China. The virus emerged late a year ago in Wuhan, Hubei's capital and a major transportation hub, and much of the province has been under virtual lockdown as China seeks to contain the virus from spreading further. China has since moved to lock down most of Hubei, with a population around the same as Italy.

First discovered in the city of Wuhan, China, earlier in January, the new strain of the pneumonia-like virus is believed to have originated in the city's animal market.

It will remain a presumptive case until the coronavirus is confirmed by a second test at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.

More recently, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded a Global Burden of Disease study to measure health care access and quality among 195 countries and territories, based on data from 2016.

World Health Organisation (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Mr Xi met in Beijing to discuss how to protect Chinese and foreigners in areas affected by the virus, as well as possible evacuation alternatives, a WHO spokesman said. Reuters reported this week that China has been slow to equip hospitals and medical centers with testing kits for the virus.

But Ma Xiaowei, the head of China's National Health Commission, said Sunday that the virus was "contagious during the incubation period", prompting worries that asymptomatic people could be spreading the disease undetected. United Airlines said it was suspending some flights between the United States and China for a week from February 1 due to a "significant decline in demand".

Some apartment blocks have forbid delivery drivers from entering, forcing them to drop off their parcels outside building gates.
