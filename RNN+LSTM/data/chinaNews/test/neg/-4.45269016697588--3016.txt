A redacted police report showed that an incident occurred Monday at Mar-a-Lago.

Palm Beach Police and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office were called to assist the Secret Service on Monday evening following an incident at President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property.

It’s unclear what the incident was, but it came a day after Trump and his family left Palm Beach after a 17-day vacation.

Michael Ogrodnick, spokesman for Palm Beach Police, said that the Secret Service is the lead agency on the incident, and that the department cannot comment on an open investigation.

The Palm Beach Daily News obtained the police report, which was heavily redacted so details of what happened are unknown. Ogrodnick said that the redaction follows Florida law. He cited statute 119.071(2)(b) regarding "criminal intelligence or investigative information received by a Florida criminal justice agency from a non-Florida criminal justice agency on a confidential or similarly restricted basis is exempt from disclosure."

An anti-Trump activist group called Mad Dog PAC conducted a floating billboard protest in the Intracoastal near Mar-a-Lago on Monday. The group had installed a 14-foot tall inflatable rat, with what appeared to be Trump’s head, on a boat.

Claude Taylor, leader of Mad Dog PAC, said the Secret Service activity was not connected to his group’s protest.

Taylor said that two Secret Service agents were monitoring the group and taking pictures of them when the agents suddenly rushed back to the main compound. Taylor said he did not know what prompted the activity.

President Trump returned to Washington on Sunday after his stay for the Christmas and New Year’s holidays.

Mar-a-Lago has been at the center of several security breaches since Trump became president. In April, Yujing Zhang, 33, sparked security concerns when she tried to gain entry Mar-a-Lago while she carried four cellphones, a computer, two Chinese passports, an external hard drive and a thumb drive.

In December, Jing Lu, 56, was confronted by the private club’s security officers and told to leave, but she returned to take photos, authorities said.

In 2018, a University of Wisconsin student fooled Secret Service and got past security at an underground tunnel during the Thanksgiving break. It took 20 minutes before he was arrested. The breach occurred the day after Thanksgiving as Trump and his family were visiting.

And on Sunday, though not apparently related to Mar-a-Lago, a 37-year-old Naples man, who was dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Marine Corps and subsequently required to register as a sex offender, was arrested after federal officials say he lied to get past presidential security checkpoints at Palm Beach International Airport. The incident happened about an hour before Trump was set to depart.
