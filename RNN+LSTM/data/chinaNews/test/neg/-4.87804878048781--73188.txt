Australian passengers trapped on the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship could face a long period in quarantine upon their return to the country to ensure they are free of the deadly coronavirus.

After more than two weeks stuck in their cabins on board the ship, which is docked off the Japanese port city of Yokohama, American passengers had been told in an email that they could face another 14 days in lockdown upon return home.

Australia was considered likely to enforce quarantine for its citizens who are evacuated from the ship, with a decision to be made later Monday.

The number of infected passengers continues to grow, with an additional 70 cases reported on Monday, taking the total to 356.

Frustration was growing among passengers as their bills began to mount while their ability to get back to normal life faced further delay.

'It's like a prison sentence for something I did not do,' Karey Mansicalco, who owns a real estate company in Utah told CNN.

'They are holding us hostage for absolutely no reason.'

She called the additional quarantine period 'financially devastating' and believes it will cost her more than $50,000.

Others have raised their concerns over the evacuation process, fearing they will be sharing flights with those who are infected.

'The US government instead wants to take us off without testing, fly us back to the US with a bunch of other untested people, and then stick us in 2 more weeks of quarantine? How does that make any sense at all?' American passenger Matthew Smith tweeted.

Symptoms of the virus include fever, cough, sore throat and shortness of breath

WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF THE CORONAVIRUS? Once someone has caught the virus it may take between two and 14 days for them to show any symptoms. If and when they do, typical signs include: a runny nose

a cough

sore throat

fever (high temperature) The vast majority of patients – at least 97 per cent, based on available data – will recover from these without any issues or medical help. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.

Those who choose not to board the chartered flight will have to stay in Japan for two weeks before heading home.

Australians on board the 'nightmare ship' are still waiting for the Morrison government to decide on a plan.

The government is awaiting a report from an Australian infectious disease expert who is in Japan assessing the situation on board the ship.

Federal cabinet minister Dan Tehan said the expert's report would be finalised on Monday.

Mr Tehan said the government would consider placing the evacuees in quarantine on Australian soil despite the cruise ship passengers having long been in lockdown.

'If they did have to go to quarantine there would be a facility available where they could go for two weeks,' he said.

'We will take the guidance from the chief medical officer as to what's the best available action to take to keep Australians safe.'

The Australians on board must pass a coronavirus test before they can be brought home, and elderly people will be given priority in the evacuation.

An additional 70 people on board the quarantined ship have been infected with the deadly coronavirus, Japan's Health Minister announced on Monday morning, taking the total of confirmed cases on board the ship to 356.

Those who tested positive for the virus are being treated in Japan.

Meanwhile, more than 200 Australians who were also evacuated from Hubei province in China and who have been quarantined on Christmas Island for two weeks were due to head home on Monday.

Of the 15 coronavirus cases in Australia, six have been cleared and the remaining nine are all stable.

In China, the total number of people infected by the virus has risen to more than 68,500, with the number of deaths now at 1665.
