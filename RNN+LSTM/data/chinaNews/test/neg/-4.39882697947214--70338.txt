This angry woman was filmed screaming at police officers guarding a coronavirus checkpoint in China and then jumping off a bridge to try and avoid capture – only to be brought back to shore in a rowing boat and arrested.

The woman, who left home after an argument with her husband, was trying to "force her way through" the checkpoint without a mask, police said.

Ms Yan, from the village of Huanjiao in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province in South China, can be seen marching up to officers manning the checkpoint on February 11.

She is stopped by the uniformed officers who notice she is not wearing a surgical mask, despite emergency rules that they must always be worn in public spaces.

In the footage, Ms Yan argues with one of the policemen and suddenly grabs onto the bridge railings and leaps over them.

Police said she did not fall into the river below and was hiding in the struts underneath the bridge.

A video filmed by a witness shows her being pushed into a small boat by cops and taken back onto the riverbank, where she was reportedly arrested.

Xie Jiansheng, deputy village secretary, told local media that the woman had been physically aggressive.

He said: "We weren't sure where she had come from. She rushed up to the checkpoint, but our staff stopped her.

"She tried to force her way through, pushing staff members. She's now in custody."

The authorities said Ms Yan tried to leave the village after an argument with her husband.
