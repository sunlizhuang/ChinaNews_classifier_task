The Philippines meanwhile reported on Sunday the first death outside China - a 44-year-old man from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak.

At least 304 people in China were confirmed dead in the 24 hours to the end of February 1, according to the National Health Commission. Thousands more were confirmed infected, bringing that total to 14,380 people.
