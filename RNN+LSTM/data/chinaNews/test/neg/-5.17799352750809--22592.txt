GPs in the UK have been told to place suspected coronavirus victims in isolation as tests on nine patients continue.

As the death toll in China rose to 25 today with more than 800 infected, authorities in the country imposed lockdowns on at least 10 cities near Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated, effectively putting 33 million people into quarantine.

Sections of the Great Wall of China and Disneyland in Shanghai were also closed.

Public Health England said 14 people had been tested in the UK, with five confirmed negative and nine awaiting results.

Five patients were in Scotland and a sixth in Belfast. Most were thought to be returning Chinese students. There are more than 120,000 Chinese students at UK colleges.

One patient was reported to be in the care of Hillingdon hospital, the nearest NHS facility to Heathrow.

In China, authorities rushed to build a hospital to treat victims. There are fears of a rise in infections as millions travel to celebrate New Year.

Mayor Sadiq Khan was asked last night by a Chinese student about London’s preparations, and said: “There is no reason to be alarmed.”

He added he had been in touch with Public Health England yesterday and had been told “there are no cases in London”. Hillingdon hospital was unable to provide an update this morning.

Mr Khan said Chinese New Year celebrations would continue as planned in Trafalgar Square on Sunday.

“We will keep an eye on what happens in Wuhan to make sure we are ready if, God forbid, this virus comes to our country,” he said.

Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS trust, which will take the lead if patients are diagnosed with coronavirus in London, said: “We are one of a network of centres in England which take patients with high consequence infectious diseases.

“Preparations are already in place across that network to accept any confirmed cases of coronavirus.”

The Department of Health has issued advice to doctors on how to treat victims. Coronavirus is classified as an “airborne high consequence infectious disease” in the UK.

Personal protective equipment is “essential” and patients should be treated in isolation rooms.

The advice states that coronaviruses in general are mainly transmitted by large respiratory droplets and direct or indirect contact with infected secretions.

It says: “In the absence of effective drugs or a vaccine, control of this disease relies on the prompt identification, appropriate risk assessment, management and isolation of possible cases, and the investigation and follow up of close contacts to minimise potential onward transmission.”

Guidance from Public Health England says doctors should check the travel history of patients.

If they suspect a patient has coronavirus, they should be placed in a room away from other patients and staff with the door shut.

The World Health Organisation yesterday stopped short of declaring the epidemic to be of international concern.

Professor Peter Piot, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who first discovered ebola, said the outbreak was at a “critical phase”.

He added: “There cannot be any complacency as to the need for global action.”

All of the deaths have been in China but the virus has been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States.

The respiratory disease is thought to have been spread by snakes or bats sold in markets in Wuhan.
