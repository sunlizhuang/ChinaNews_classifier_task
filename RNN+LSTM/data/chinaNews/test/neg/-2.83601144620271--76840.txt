Raw milk is at the forefront of many legislators’ minds as Kansas farmers and consumers worry about the sale of straight-from-the-animal milk. Raw milk is not pasteurized and has the potential to carry food-borne illnesses, according to a Wichita Eagle article. Kansas currently allows the sale of raw milk, but sales are limited to the farm the milk originates from. The growing number of illnesses linked to the drink is causing concern.

The Senate Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee has been hearing arguments for a ban. Some senators have given the impression of being for regulation that may include warning labels. Mary Powell, a Kansas resident with livestock experience, drinks raw milk and said that those who drink it know the health risks.

“We find out what is best for us and we consume it,” Powell said.

At least 10 percent of China’s population is living under government restrictions. The government is regulating when citizens can leave their homes due to the novel coronavirus. Efforts to control the coronavirus include checking residents’ IDs and temperatures when they leave and enter neighborhoods. The economy in China has also taken a toll — companies such as HSBC, Hong Kong’s largest bank, plans to cut 35,000 jobs, according to a New York Times article. Apple has also said their business has been affected by the virus. All 42 Apple stores in China closed last month and have yet to be reopened. The demand for Apple devices in the country has dwindled as well.
