BUTLER COUNTY, Ohio — No, no one at Lakota East High School has coronavirus.

School officials are aware of false information that's been circulating, according to Lauren Boettcher, spokeswoman at Lakota Local School District.

A screenshot of a fake headline, “Lakota East student diagnosed with coronavirus, officials report” has been going around. But no cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Ohio. Boettcher said school officials would have notified parents and students if someone had the virus.

Health officials are testing two Miami University students for the virus after they displayed some symptoms upon returning from China. Results from those tests could be released as early as Thursday.

Officials have emphasized that people who have not recently traveled to China have a "low risk" of getting the coronavirus, and again, there are no confirmed cases of the virus in Ohio.

According to the CDC, the five people in the U.S. known to have contracted coronavirus traveled to Wuhan, China - the center of the outbreak. And there has been no person-to-person spread of the disease in the U.S.
