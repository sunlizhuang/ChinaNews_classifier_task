Residents in the Chinese city of Wuhan who have been infected with coronavirus are being rounded up and put in isolation.

China is ramping up efforts to contain the new virus, which has now claimed at least 632 lives in the country. Other countries, including New Zealand, have banned foreign travellers from China.

Authorities in Wuhan have been ordered by a senior official to put residents with symptoms in isolation, quarantine or designated hospitals, the New York Times reported.

​Wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub in the province of Hubei, has been in lockdown for two weeks now after the new virus was first identified there. The first cases were connected to people who worked at or visited a seafood market, now closed.

A Chinese doctor who got in trouble with authorities in the communist country for sounding an early warning about the coronavirus outbreak died on Friday after coming down with the illness.

﻿Sun Chunlan, a vice premier leading the central government's coronavirus response, said "there must be no deserters" during "these war-time conditions", the New York Times reported.

Wuhan residents have been told to check their body temperature on a daily basis and report it to local health authorities. Authorities have been told to conduct door-to-door inspections, and interview infected people's contacts.

​Makeshift quarantine shelters have been set up but there are fears that they will not be able to protect against further infection, or even provide basic care to patients.

Hubei province reported 69 additional deaths on February 6, bringing the death toll in mainland China to at least 632. Hubei accounts for 618 of the fatalities in China.

Hubei added 2447 new cases over the 24-hour period, according to a statement from the province's health commission. Total confirmed cases in Hubei are now 22,112.

Outside of mainland China, Hong Kong has reported one death, while the Philippines had a fatality last week.

​Tianjin, a Chinese port city of some 15.6 million people, said it will restrict movement in residential compounds citywide in an effort to slow the coronavirus's spread there.

The city borders Beijing and has only reported 78 cases and one death so far, but authorities across China have taken drastic measures to slow the virus's spread outside the centre of the outbreak in Wuhan. There are more than 25,000 cases across China, concentrated mainly in Hubei province.

Tianjin authorities said that residential areas will check and register people who come into communities, limit the access of deliveries and food orders, and restrict entrances and exits, according to the state media People's Daily.

The notice also calls for keeping track of people with electronic registration systems and enhancing management of rentals.

At the same time, authorities in Beijing are growing increasingly angry and have registered "strong objections" with countries imposing harsh travel restrictions on visitors from China.

The travel advice to New Zealanders for all of mainland China has been raised to "do not travel" by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the highest level possible.

Nations are ignoring recommendations from the World Health Organisation and the International Civil Aviation Organization, which have advised against cancelling flight routes and limiting travel to affected nations, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.
