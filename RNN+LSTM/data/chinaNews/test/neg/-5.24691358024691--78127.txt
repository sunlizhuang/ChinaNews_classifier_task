The State Council of China has decided to postpone the new semester of universities in the wake of the deadly coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese Embassy has informed the Union Health ministry.

The students will be notified by their respective universities.

According to an official, several students who had returned from China after the epidemic had approached the health ministry saying their respective universities were asking them to join back or they would lose their admission status.

"The issue was taken up by Union Health Secretary Preeti Sudan during her meeting with the Chinese Ambassador recently," an official statement said.

"This request has been responded to favourably. The Chinese Embassy has written that the State Council of China has decided to postpone the new semester of the universities, including Southwest University for which Secretary had represented. The students will be notified by their respective universities accordingly," it said.
