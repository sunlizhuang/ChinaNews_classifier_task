A 13th case of the coronavirus in the United States was confirmed Monday, while a person in Maine is being tested for the illness, according to public health officials.

A seventh person in California was infected with the virus, named 2019-nCoV. The patient, who has been under federal quarantine, recently returned from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak of the respiratory illness started in December, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.

“CDC is conducting a thorough contact investigation of the person who has tested positive to determine contacts and to assess if those contacts had high risk exposures,” the statement said.

Other coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Arizona, Illinois, Washington, Wisconsin and Massachusetts. More than 315 people have tested negative for the disease in the U.S., and 68 patients are awaiting test results, according to the CDC’s website.

A UMass Boston student was diagnosed with the illness earlier this month. The patient, a man in his 20s, arrived at Boston Logan International Airport after traveling to Wuhan. He sought medical attention and has remained isolated in his off-campus housing since late January, according to the Boston Public Health Commission.

The risk of the virus to Massachusetts and the general American public remains low, according to the CDC, though the threat internationally is high.

More than 40,500 cases of the illness have been confirmed globally, 40,235 of which were reported in China, according to the World Health Organization’s most recent situation report. The country has also seen 909 deaths due to the virus. Only one person outside of China has died from the infection.

The death toll in China rose by 97 in 24 hours from Saturday to Sunday, a 15% jump. The number of deaths has surpassed the 774 people who died from the SARS epidemic in the early 2000s, another outbreak that originated in China, the Associated Press reported.

Because the 2019-nCoV has caused people to die and there is sustained person-to-person spread in China, two criteria of a pandemic have been met, the CDC said.

“It’s unclear how the situation will unfold, but risk is dependent on exposure,” the CDC’s website says. “At this time, some people will have an increased risk of infection, for example healthcare workers caring for 2019-nCoV patients and other close contacts of 2019-nCoV patients.”

The first case of a person being tested for 2019-nCoV in Maine was reported Monday, the state’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. The patient agreed to stay home in accordance with federal guidelines.

Members of the Colby College community who traveled to mainland China have been isolated and are being monitored out of caution, the school said. The person in Maine who is being tested is not associated with alternative housing provided to some students by Colby, though, according to the agency.

“This test follows protocols established by the U.S. CDC. At this point, 37 states have sent samples to the U.S. CDC for testing, and the vast majority of those tests have come back negative," Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, said in the agency’s statement.

In January, the CDC warned people to avoid all nonessential travel to China, and earlier this month, the White House suspended entry of foreign nationals into the county who have traveled to China within the past 14 days. U.S. residents as well as their immediate family members who have visited the Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, are allowed to enter the U.S., but they may be monitored or quarantined for up to two weeks, according to the CDC.

The agency made its coronavirus test kits available for domestic and international partners last week. The CDC said it has also continued to upload the entire genome of the viruses online from the confirmed cases in the U.S.

A vaccine for 2019-nCoV does not exist, but public health officials have urged people to take preventative measures similar to those taken during the flu season. Precautionary steps include covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds and staying home if one’s sick.
