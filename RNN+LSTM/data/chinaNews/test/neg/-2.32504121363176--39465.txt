National/World

The novel coronavirus has spread throughout the world since the first cases were detected in central China in December. More than 3,400 people have died globally and over 101,000 have been infected, according to CNN’s tally.

China’s National Health Commission has confirmed the virus, which causes a disease known as Covid-19, can be transmitted from person to person through “droplet transmission” — where a virus is passed on due to an infected person sneezing or coughing — as well as by direct contact.

In mainland China, more than 80,600 cases of the virus and over 3,000 deaths have been recorded — the vast majority in Hubei province, ground zero for the outbreak.

There are more than 20,800 confirmed cases of the virus in at least 85 countries and territories outside mainland China. Over 700 of those cases are linked to the Diamond Princess cruise ship.

At least 360 people have died outside of mainland China from the virus.
