PUTRAJAYA: There is no need to halt all flights from China, says the Prime Minister.

However, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said the matter will be weighed.

“We will study if there is a need to suspend all flights from China or just those from Wuhan city and Hubei province, which has been done, ” he told reporters after a meeting with the Rural Development Ministry’s strategic partners.

The Prime Minister was asked if the Federal Government would make a similar move as Sabah, which has halted flights from China.

The Sabah government has decided to temporarily suspend all scheduled and chartered flights from China with immediate effect until further notice due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The government has imposed a temporary ban on Chinese citizens from Wuhan city and the surrounding Hubei province.

On Malaysia’s efforts to bring home its citizens from Wuhan, Dr Mahathir said China had yet to respond to the request.

“We have just initiated talks with them. There is no response yet (from China), ” he said.

The Cabinet in its weekly meeting on Wednesday decided to bring back 78 Malaysians currently in Wuhan, the epicentre of the novel coronavirus.

However, they will be quarantined for 14 days and given a clean bill of health before they are allowed to return.

Meanwhile, the Immigration Department deported 14 passengers from a flight that had landed here on Tuesday after they were found to be from Wuhan, China.

Home Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said the “Not to Land” order was given after a check on their travel documents was conducted.

“I was informed that on Jan 28,14 passengers from Wuhan landed at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. They were then disallowed from entering and have been sent back, ” he said at a press conference at Bukit Aman here yesterday.

When asked about the welfare of frontliners, especially at ports of entry, he said the men and women working there were following strict procedures set by the Health Ministry.

On the spate of fake news on the novel coronavirus, Muhyiddin said that such actions will only create unrest and panic.

“You have to ask them (those spreading fake news) of their motives for doing so, ” he said, adding that action had been taken on seven such cases.

Cases such as these fall under the jurisdiction of both the police and the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).

Both MCMC and Bukit Aman said arrests had been made for those allegedly spreading fake news regarding the coronavirus.

On the possibility of reintroducing the Anti-Fake News Act, he said that it had to be discussed at the government level.

“That’s something that we might want to rethink if necessary but what is important is the current situation. We have other laws like the Penal Code and the police are taking action based on that, ” he said.

The government has halted the issuance of visas for Chinese citizens from Wuhan and Hubei province with immediate effect, with the Prime Minister’s Office saying the decision was made to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.

In an unrelated issue, the Home Ministry will be giving an added allocation to the police this year to improve the welfare of personnel and to upgrade ageing buildings and equipment.

“As a whole, the Royal Malaysia Police have been granted a larger allocation for this year compared

to last year. But due to the burden and responsibilities of keeping the peace, they require more, including renewing their aged assets. I have decided that this needs to be looked at, ” he said, adding that the police will be receiving 200 new MPVs.
