The Health Ministry on Sunday called on citizens to reconsider nonessential travel to various Southeast Asian destinations in an effort to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus into Israel.Following a situational assessment, the ministry said citizens should now reconsider plans to travel to Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Macao, South Korea and Taiwan. A warning regarding travel to China , the epicenter of the virus, has been in place since January 26.No Israelis have tested positive for the virus to date, which has killed more than 810 Chinese citizens and infected at least 37,100. Two Chinese citizens have died outside mainland China since the start of the outbreak, in Thailand and Hong Kong.Despite the additional travel warnings, the Health Ministry said self-quarantine is only required for individuals arriving in Israel within two weeks of leaving China. Those in isolation should refrain from direct contact with family members.“The ministry sees the public as a key partner in operations to prevent the outbreak of the illness,” the Health Ministry said in a statement. “Only with the joint effort of everyone will we successfully deal with a possible outbreak in Israel.”El Al halted all flights to Beijing on January 30 amid the outbreak, but flights have continued to Hong Kong and Bangkok. Despite media reports on Sunday that El Al was canceling flights to Hong Kong, a representative for the airline said flights “are continuing as normal.” El Al is scheduled to inaugurate a new route connecting Tel Aviv and Tokyo on March 11.Seeking to increase awareness and reduce chances of an outbreak in Israel, the Health Ministry broadcast a one-minute video across all major television channels on Sunday.
