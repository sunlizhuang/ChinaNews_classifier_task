To Mrs Christiana Ogaranya, rats are no longer harmless rodents she took them for a few months ago. Its sight now raises fears and tickles memories of sorrow and pain.

Her two sons, Ephraim and Uchechi, were down with an acute fever in December 2019 after eating a piece of fish suspected to have been tampered with by rats.

Hours after consuming the fish, Ephraim and Uchehi started exhibiting some symptoms. It began with dizziness. Some days later, the siblings grew frail so much that taking them to hospital was not an option despite the poor status of the family.

Christiana was worried. What could have suddenly made her gaily sons become shadows of themselves?

Tests run on the residents of Nwakaleke village – a suburb of Izzi Local Government Area of Ebonyi State – at the Virology Centre in Abakaliki revealed they had contracted Lassa virus.

The virus is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items

contaminated with rodent urine or faeces, says World Health Organisation. It is also transmittable through person-to-person infections.

Medical treatment was commenced amid a frenzy of anxiety that dovetailed into a mixed bag of tragic mood. In the end, the acute viral haemorrhagic illness claimed the life of 15-year-old Ephraim but spared Uchechi.

All the family members were examined at the virology centre to know if they had the killer virus and they were certified okay. But none of them returned home happy.

“Life is now in unbearable for me and my children,” 56-year-old Christiana said while lamenting the loss of her son.

“Remembering our burnt house and property, and now, the death of my son, Ephraim, makes me a hopeless and confused mother,” she told Saturday PUNCH; her face welled up in tears.

About 41 persons have been killed by the virus according to the Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control this. From January 1 to 26, NCDC disclosed that 689 suspected cases were reported; 258 of which were confirmed cases.

The cases were recorded in 19 states including Ondo, Edo, Ebonyi, Enugu, Kano, Borno, Nasarawa, Kogi, Rivers, Abia, Adamawa, Benue, Kaduna, Delta, Taraba, Plateau, Bauchi, Osun and Ogun states. Five among the fatality figures were health workers in Kano, Taraba and Borno states.

While Nigeria struggles to battle the virus, other countries in the world like China, United States and Congo are also grappling with deadly infections.

On December 30, about time Ephraim and Uchehi were down with Lassa fever, a medical doctor Li Wenliang dropped a bombshell thousands of miles away in Wuhan, China. Wenliang raised the alarm in an alumni WeChat group – the popular Chinese messaging app – he belonged to, that seven patients from a local seafood market had been diagnosed with an acute respiratory illness and quarantined in his hospital.

He concluded that the illness was coronavirus – a large family of viruses that includes severe acute respiratory syndrome.

The 2002 memories of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in China are still fresh when its outbreak killed hundreds following a government cover-up. “I only wanted to remind my university classmates to be careful,” CNN quoted Wenliang’s post.

In the days that followed, Wuhan, the central Chinese city turned to the epicenter of the deadly outbreak. The virus has since spread to other parts of the country and the US, claiming over 630 lives, including 34-year-old Wenliang, as of Friday.

It has also sickened more than 31,400 people, and has been confirmed in more than 25 countries and territories.

China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating occurrence of person-to-person spread.

Worryingly, no specific antiviral treatment has yet to be recommended for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, although international researchers are making frantic efforts to develop a vaccine.

Nearly 60 million people remain under lockdown in China while more that 3,000 people on board a cruise ship in Japan have been quarantined at the port after a former passenger was found infected a few days earlier.

The outbreak is taking a huge toll on the Chinese economy too. The Cable News Network reported that Monday’s market sell-off in China was the worst in many years with nearly $500bn depreciation in the value of the country’s biggest companies.

In the ensuing fears, some countries have temporarily placed restriction on people travelling from China. The British Foreign Office has also advised its nationals in China to leave if they had the opportunity.

Alarmingly, Nigeria, which is home to many Chinese companies, has been fingered by WHO as one of the countries with high risk of coronavirus. The Nigerian government is not unaware of this fact as it promised to intensify monitoring at airports across the country.

The Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, at a press briefing in Abuja on January 28, noted that the Federal Ministry of Health had issued advisories to the relevant government agencies and the public on the outbreak of the disease.

“The risk of importation was high even though no single suspected case has been reported in Nigeria,” he had said.

Flu, Ebola also among

Apart from coronavirus that is now a threat to the US, influenza is a major illness the world super power currently contends with.

Popularly called flu, the virus usually occurs between September and March. It has infected about 19 million Americans and killed at least 10,000 people this season alone, CNBC reported.

The 2019-2020 flu season is projected to be one of the worst in a decade according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. And at least 180,000 people have been hospitalised with complications from the flu– a viral infection that attacks respiratory system such as nose, throat and lungs.

The flu is a constant in Americans’ lives, said Dr Margot Savoy, Chair of Family and Community Medicine at Temple University’s Lewis Katz School of Medicine.

“It’s that familiarity that makes it more dangerous to underestimate. Lumping all the viral illness we tend to catch in the winter sometimes makes us too comfortable thinking everything is ‘just a bad cold.’ We underestimate how deadly influenza really is,” the doctor said.

The Centers for Disease Control predicts at least 12,000 people will die from the flu in the US every year. In the 2017-2018 flu season, at least 61,000 people died, and 45 million sickened.

People at higher risk of developing flu complications include young children under age five, adults older than age 65, residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, pregnant women and women up to two weeks postpartum, people with weakened immune systems and people who have chronic illnesses, such as asthma, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease and diabetes.

As coronavirus poses a threat to many countries of the world including African region, Democratic Republic of Congo has another monster in Ebola Virus Disease to reckon with. EVD is a viral haemorrhagic fever of humans and other primates caused by Ebola virus.

Ebola created a panic in Nigeria in 2014 after some medical workers at First Consultants Hospital, Obalende, Lagos, had a contact with a Liberian Ebola patient, Patrick Sawyer, who was flown to Nigeria sick. The late Dr Stella Adadevoh of the FCH paid the supreme price to prevent what could have been widespread in the country.

DR Congo is currently going through the “worst-case scenario,” of the outbreak and it may take up to two years to end, a WHO official, Dr Mike Ryan, said.

The outbreak, which began on August 1, 2018 “is not under control,” Ryan, who is an executive director of WHO Health Emergencies Programme was quoted by the CNN. “We may end up dealing with this outbreak for a long time,” he added.

More than 2200 lives had been lost and 3300 infections confirmed since the outbreak was declared. The outbreak is occurring in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Neighbouring countries are taking steps to mitigate the spread.

WHO has more than 800 workers on the ground supporting the government-led response together with national and international partner.

As of February 3, 2020, Ministry of Health, DR Congo, said a total of 3428 cases had been recorded, with 2246 deaths and 1157 survivors.

No national, global awareness to tackle epidemics – Expert

Commenting on the situation, a virologist, Prof Oyewale Tomori, noted there was lack of national and global preparedness to prevent, survey, detect, diagnose and respond to epidemics.

He stated that the Lassa fever had become a constant and an embarrassing feature of Nigeria’s deplorable national health system in the last 50 years.

He said, “The disease is now reported in nearly all the states of Nigeria, with increasing numbers of suspected cases, dry season peaks and unacceptably high case fatality rates. The spread of the disease throughout the country may have resulted from increasing human-rodent contact in an atmosphere of explosive rodent population and a pervasive poor environmental sanitation.

“Lassa fever disease is now a public health event of national concern. It is obvious that previous Nigerian governments have not done enough to prevent or contain the perennial outbreaks of Lassa fever.

Tomori, a former president, Nigerian Academy of Science, urged the government to set up a standing multidisciplinary ‘One-Health Committee’ to advise and assist appropriate government agencies with the investigation and management of Lassa fever outbreaks.

He also called for adequate funds for a sensitive disease surveillance system and a reliable laboratory network as well extensive and sustained Lassa fever prevention and control awareness programme.

“A functional isolation ward for the treatment of Lassa fever patients should be established in each state and government should provide funds for research into finding new drug for Lassa fever treatment and development of Lassa fever vaccine,” Tomori added.

The former vice chancellor, Redeemer’s University, said monitoring systems should be intensified at the ports to check passengers arriving in Nigeria, especially those coming directly or indirectly from China and countries currently reporting coronavirus.

He maintained that Nigeria had the capacity to handle possible coronavirus outbreak, but lacked the enabling environment in terms of basic infrastructural facilities, acceptable work ethics, accountability and genuine commitment that would drive ‘capacity and capability.’

“The Nigerian environment is toxic to excellence, turning the expert into a bungling mediocre,” he concluded.
