The Royal Caribbean cruise ship docked in Bayonne due to concerns over coronavirus will remain in the port through the weekend to allow for a full screening of the ship's passengers, cruise line officials said Saturday.

Royal Caribbean officials said in a statement that the ship would remain at Cape Liberty Cruise Port until Monday to “have conclusive results before sailing.”

“Due to the volume of tests they are conducting for coronavirus, they will need the next 24-48 hours to complete the test,” the statement said.

So far, federal, state and cruise line representatives have not publicly confirmed any cases of coronavirus among the ship's passengers. The respiratory illness has killed more than 720 people in China, where the outbreak began late last year, according to the World Health Organization.

One of the four passengers of a Royal Caribbean cruise ship in Bayonne who were sent to the hospital after a coronavirus screening tested positive for the flu, the cruise line said.

The four passengers were among 27 in total who were recently in China and were screened for novel coronavirus, Gov. Phil Murphy said in a statement. Royal Caribbean said in a tweet that the four passengers had not been to China since Jan. 26.

The status of the other three passengers who were sent to the hospital is unknown.

"New Jersey currently has no confirmed cases of novel coronavirus and the risk to residents remains low," Murphy said.

All other passengers were released without any further evaluation, Bayonne Mayor Jimmy Davis said in a tweet on Friday.

"I was advised [that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] considers this [a] “Below Low Risk” situation," Davis tweeted.

Initial symptoms of novel coronavirus are similar to those of the flu, said Dr. David Allan, an infectious-diseases expert at Rutgers Medical School.

Allan stressed the importance of getting a flu vaccination, as it would help decipher whether symptoms are an indicator of the flu or novel coronavirus.

The Anthem of the Seas ship was set to depart for another voyage Friday afternoon but was delayed despite receiving clearance, out of an abundance of caution, Royal Caribbean said in a tweet.

Davis did not immediately respond for further comment.

The three other passengers were taken to University Hospital. A hospital spokesperson deferred questions to the state Department of Health, which did not immediately respond to a request for more information.

On Friday, Royal Caribbean barred all travelers who hold Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passports, have traveled through mainland "China or Hong Kong in the past 15 days" or have had contact with someone who did from boarding its ships. The cruise line is also requiring specialized health screenings on guests who report flu-like symptoms.

"Like airlines, we are participating in elevated levels of guest screening to check the spread of coronavirus," a Royal Caribbean spokesperson said in a statement. "We are closely monitoring developments regarding coronavirus and have rigorous medical protocols in place onboard our ships."

The CDC did not respond to requests for comment.

A Princess Cruises ship quarantined off the coast of Yokohoma, Japan, had 61 confirmed cases, including 11 Americans, as of Friday.

The disruption to the cruise lines has had a negative impact on the industry, with shares in Carnival Corporation, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean International all seeing 8 to 14 percent declines since the outbreak began, said Brandt Montour, a gaming and lodging analyst for J.P Morgan.

Royal Caribbean is offering full refunds, hotel accommodation reimbursement and flight rescheduling fees to its Anthem of the Seas passengers to compensate for the delay.

Since the coronavirus outbreak was first reported in December 2019, there have been more than 34,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world , according to the World Health Organization.

The CDC on Wednesday confirmed a case of the virus in Wisconsin, the 12th in the U.S. Earlier U.S. cases were confirmed in Washington, Arizona, Illinois, California and Massachusetts.

Health officials cleared two individuals in New Jersey who were tested for the virus in late January.

A traveler who arrived at Newark Airport from China was issued a 14-day quarantine, although the person did not present any symptoms of coronavirus, officials said.

Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, a large military installation that sprawls across Ocean and Burlington counties, was designated Thursday as an emergency camp to quarantine potential patients in the event of an outbreak.

To be tested, the Health Department said, the patient must have a fever of 100.4 degrees or more and symptoms of lower respiratory illness such as a cough and shortness of breath and must have traveled from Wuhan, China, within the previous two weeks or had close contact with a person under investigation for infection with the virus while that person was ill.
