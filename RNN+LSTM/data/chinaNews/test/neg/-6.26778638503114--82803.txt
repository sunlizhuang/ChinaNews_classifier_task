Feb. 22 (UPI) -- Iran confirmed five deaths from the coronavirus Saturday, the highest death toll outside of China where the figure has reached 2,345.

World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the organization was "especially concerned about the increase in cases in the Islamic Republic of Iran."

Iran confirmed 28 cases of COVID-19 infection despite the country insisting as recently as Tuesday that it had no cases. By Wednesday, Iran said it had five cases in people with a history of travel to China and two deaths. By Friday, four deaths were confirmed in Iran from the outbreak.

Furthermore, a case in Lebanon appeared to be linked to Iran, along with a new case in Canada.

Iran was the first in the Middle East to declare deaths related to the virus.

Kianush Jahnpur, a health ministry spokesperson, wrote in a tweet that at least two cases were in Qom, 80 miles south of the capital of Tehran. Officials also confirmed coronavirus cases in Tehran and the northern city of Rasht.

Fars New Agency tweeted a video showing some people wearing masks while waiting in line to vote in Iran's weekend parliamentary elections.

A team of World Health Organization experts traveled Saturday to the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak started.

Ghebreyesus confirmed the trip during an address Saturday to African officials from Geneva where he spoke on the global spread and urged them to prepare.

The continent has only one case in Egypt of the coronavirus, but health officials warned that the outbreak could be deadly in countries where the health system is already strained.

WHO provided online training to 11,000 African health workers on the coronavirus.

"The cases that we see in the rest of the world, although numbers are small, but not linked to Wuhan or China, it's very worrisome," Ghebreyesus said Friday. "Those dots are actually very concerning."

Meanwhile, the number of infections in China rose above 76,000 Saturday with a dozen infections confirmed at a single nursing home in Wuhan. The nursing home, Wuhan Social Welfare Institute, said 11 residents and one employee had the virus, according to a notice from the municipal civil affairs bureau in Wuhan.

Elderly people are particularly vulnerable to the virus with many reported deaths occurring in people 60 and older. Nursing homes usually house residents in close quarters, which facilitates the rapid spread of the virus, The New York Times reported.

Between Daegu, South Korea's fourth largest city, and a nearby province where sect members do volunteer work, 352 people tested positive.
