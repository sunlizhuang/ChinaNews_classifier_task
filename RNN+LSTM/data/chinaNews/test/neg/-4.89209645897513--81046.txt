NEW DELHI: Kathmandu Post , a leading English daily of Nepal, has pulled up China for trying to muzzle free speech after it was accused of "deliberate" and "malicious" smearing by the Chinese embassy in the Himalayan state.The Chinese embassy had sharply criticised the Kathmandu Post on Tuesday for publishing a syndicated column which argued that China's authoritarian system of government had worsened the deadly coronavirus outbreak "The Chinese embassy did not just express its discontent with the article published; it went so far as to disparage the Post's Editor-in-Chief and employ threatening language," the Kathmandu Post said in an editorial on Thursday."The undiplomatic - and frankly menacing - manner in which the Chinese embassy made its objections known is condemnable," it added."The actions of the embassy ... can be perceived as a direct threat to the Nepali people's right to a free press, freedom of opinion and freedom of expression."â€œChina can ... express its reservations," the paper said. "What it cannot do, especially in a democracy, is demand that articles be taken down and then issue veiled threats against the editor of a foreign newspaper."The article "deliberately smeared the efforts of the Chinese government and people ... and even viciously attacked the political system of China", the Chinese embassy had said.It added that the Kathmandu Post's chief editor Anup Kaphle "has always been biased on China-related issues" and had become "a parrot of some anti-China forces"."The Chinese Embassy in Nepal has made solemn representations to the newspaper and himself and reserves the right of further action."Eighteen Nepali editors issued a statement Wednesday against the embassy's statement -- particularly the targeting of Kaphle."Nepal's constitution has guaranteed full press freedom, and we are committed to exercising and protecting it," they said.China has tried to woo Nepal with pledges of finances in the Himalayan nation, pumping millions of dollars into projects ranging from roads to hydropower plants. Recently China even operated a border management pact to control cross border movement of Tibetans.
