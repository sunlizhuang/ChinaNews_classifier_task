Comeuppance for the scaremongers is coming after Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra directed the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to look into the alleged dissemination of disinformation about the novel coronavirus (nCoV).

The NBI will probe the “deliberate” spread of misinformation and false reporting of the coronavirus that had created unnecessary panic among the public after the flu-like disease claimed its initial victims, including one resident of Wuhan City, considered ground zero of the virus, who died at the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila.

“If evidence warrants, appropriate charges will be filed against persons found responsible therefor,” Guevarra said in his order.

The spreading of fake news was meant to fan a hysteria and which was evidently politically motivated after, all of a sudden, an #OustDuterte call was raised.

Made as an excuse for the movement was the supposed mishandling of the situation that the yellow mob claims endangered the lives of Filipinos.

It was the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations body monitoring the progress of the nCoV, which frustrated the pathetic yellow mob’s attempt at generating an outcry.

WHO Philippines representative Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe said the government is doing a good job responding to the “evolving situation.”

“We are satisfied so far with the measures being implemented by the government of the Philippines,” the WHO official noted.

“WHO commends the actions taken by the Philippine Government to strengthen its preparedness, to build capacity to detect cases,” he added.

Department of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III reported that the DoH is now capable of detecting nCoV carriers within 48 hours without the need of assistance from foreign experts.

The Japanese counterpart of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine gave the RNA (ribonucleic acid) primer, which is crucial in detecting the virus.

The turnaround time will be cut by 50 percent since the acquisition of the primer would eliminate the need to consult Australian experts, he noted.

Proof of the effectivity of the government thus far in containment is the absence of confirmed local transmission since the two positive cases were from visitors.

Another confidence booster is the temporary conversion of the drug rehabilitation center in Fort Magsaysay, Nueva Ecija as a quarantine area for Filipino workers returning from Wuhan, China.

Fort Magsaysay can accommodate up to 10,000 people, according to the DoH.

Work in the background without the rhetoric that precedes government action as what the previous yellow administration is used to may have baffled the critics of Rody and mistook the efforts as inaction.

The #OustDuterte campaign lasted for a few hours before dying down and losing support as social media users realized the exploitation they were subjected to.

Reason always prevails over the vicious noises that the opponents of Rody employ time and again in their unending lust for power.
