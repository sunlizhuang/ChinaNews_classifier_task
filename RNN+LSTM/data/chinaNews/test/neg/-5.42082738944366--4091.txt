WASHINGTON — When Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a news conference this week in which he justified President Trump’s order to kill Iran’s most powerful general, he also took the opportunity to criticize China twice: for its mass detentions of Muslims and for its repressive policies in Hong Kong.

China hit back immediately. “It must be pointed out that the wars staged by the U.S. in the Middle East over the past years have caused countless Muslim casualties and displacement as well as turmoil in the region,” a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said at a news conference in Beijing. “As has been proven, it is precisely the U.S. that has infringed upon Muslim human rights.”

“Its attempts to sow discord between China and Islamic states are futile in the end,” he added.

Mr. Trump’s military strike on the Iranian general and other aggressive actions against Tehran gave China ammunition to undermine the administration’s main line of critique on Beijing’s human rights record. And they have allowed China, the United States’ greatest rival for global influence, to raise the specter of the Iraq war, which, by one count, left 200,000 civilians or more dead and is considered by many Americans to be Washington’s greatest foreign policy disaster of the post-Vietnam era.

Beijing also stresses that it was Mr. Trump who destabilized the Middle East by withdrawing in May 2018 from a landmark nuclear deal that Iran had reached with six world powers, including China and the United States, and reimposing sanctions on Tehran. China is Iran’s biggest buyer of oil.
