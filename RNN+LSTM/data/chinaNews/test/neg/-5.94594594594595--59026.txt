(WQOW)- The impacts of the coronavirus are extending further than just health concerns; it's affecting the bottom line for a number of Wisconsin industries, including dairy farmers.

Since the virus has killed so many people in China, the United States has temporarily suspended entry of travelers coming from China, and is instructing people not travel to the country.



Uw-Eau Claire economics department chair, Thomas Kemp said this is concerning for farmers because China is one of the top importers of dairy products.



He said the inability to sell there will directly impact farmers.



Kemp said it just adds to the continued slow growth of our economy.

"We look at growth rates and hiring and a lot of those indicators point to the possibility of a slowdown," Kemp said. "Of course, problems with China and the coronavirus doesn't help that. That said, I wouldn't go so far to say a recession is inevitable."



The manufacturing industry in Wisconsin is also being hurt by the virus, with state exports to China totaling more than $2 billion, according to state data.
