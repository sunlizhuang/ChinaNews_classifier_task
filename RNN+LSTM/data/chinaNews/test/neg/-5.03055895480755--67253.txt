The World Health Organization reports more than 40,000 cases of the new coronavirus with 1000 deaths, exceeding the 2003 SARS death toll. Public health responses vary around the world, and China now relies on those to assess its ties with other nations. For example, China has chastised the United States and other countries for imposing travel bans that incite panic and isolate the Chinese economy. On the other hand, Cambodia’s leader offered to travel to Wuhan to show solidarity, suggesting that scholarships could end for Cambodian students who left the region. “Now struggling to control the virus’s fast spread, the government has resorted to criticising foreign governments for hostile intent towards China in taking measures to protect their citizens,” explains Nayan Chanda, founding editor of YaleGlobal, in his column for the Times of India. He praises Chinese scientists for swift identification of the coronavirus genome, allowing for testing, yet leaders “squandered valuable time.” Chanda urges China to adopt protective measures rather than engage in bullying. – YaleGlobal
