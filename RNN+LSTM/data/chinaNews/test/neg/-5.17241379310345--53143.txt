In a local reaction to the global coronavirus outbreak, a Monroe County resident who just returned from China is at home in voluntary quarantine.

The person is healthy with no symptoms of viral infection, but agreed to stay home out of an abundance of caution, Dr. Michael D. Mendoza, Monroe County's public health commissioner, said on Tuesday.

There have been no known cases in New York state of infection by 2019 novel coronavirus, and only 11 in the United States overall.

More than 20,000 people have been sickened in China, where the virus was first identified late last year, and more than 400 people have died.

Mendoza and County Executive Adam Bello, at a news conference Tuesday afternoon, reminded people that the new virus is far from the worst communicable disease at hand.

"The coronavirus is a concern because it's new, but influenza is a far bigger threat," Bello said.

Nearly 2,400 Monroe County residents have had confirmed cases of the flu through late January, and four have died, Mendoza said. Nationwide there have been 19 million cases and roughly 10,000 deaths from seasonal flu.

The threat from coronavirus is much less here, health officials worldwide have been taking ever-more-stringent precautions to keep it from spreading.

In the United States, the federal government implemented emergency restrictions on Sunday that require U.S. citizens returning from China to pass through health screening at one of 11 major airports and then agree to be self-quarantined for up to 14 days.

The local resident arrived here Saturday, the day before the restrictions went into place, but contacted the health department and agreed to follow the federal protocol.

The person checks his or her temperature frequently and communicates daily with county health workers about any possible symptoms.

Mendoza described the person as "a very cooperative individual." The voluntary home confinement will extend through Feb. 14.

State officials said Tuesday that six people in New York are awaiting test results to rule out the presence of the novel coronavirus. Mendoza said those six are people who traveled to China and have some signs of illness; the quarantined Monroe resident, who is not sick, is not one of them.

Mendoza also said the all-clear has been sounded by the University of Rochester, which had been observing a number of students and faculty members who traveled home to China over the university's winter break. Some had been in Wuhan, the central China metropolis where the virus was first found in humans.

The UR placed those who had been to China under observation to watch for any symptoms of illness. Mendoza said all of those students and faculty were healthy and none of them show any signs of having been exposed to the coronavirus.
