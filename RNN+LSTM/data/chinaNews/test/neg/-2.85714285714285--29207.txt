Two people in New Hampshire who recently traveled from Wuhan, China, are being monitored after showing respiratory symptoms, Granite State health officials said, as Boston officials outlined plans to prepare for the potential of a novel coronavirus outbreak in the city.

The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services announced two people recently in Wuhan, where the virus originated in a live animal market, are undergoing testing for coronavirus after showing signs.

“There are currently two individuals in New Hampshire with recent travel to Wuhan City, China, who have developed respiratory symptoms and are currently undergoing testing for novel coronavirus,” the agency said in a press release. “These people have more mild illness, but both sought healthcare for their illnesses and are recovering. They remain isolated until test results are available. Samples have been sent to the CDC for testing.”

“The risk to our communities in New Hampshire is low, but we want to identify people who may be infected with this new coronavirus in order to prevent spread,” N.H. State Epidemiologist Dr. Benjamin Chan said in a statement. “We have recommended that healthcare providers conduct travel screenings and implement isolation practices for patients with a fever or respiratory illness who report travel to this affected region of China. This is a rapidly changing situation, and we remain committed to providing timely updates to residents of New Hampshire and our health care providers.”

Meanwhile, the Boston Public Health Commission announced yesterday it has activated its internal incident command system to help with communication and coordinate response should the virus come to the city.

“We are constantly assessing potential threats and will be ready in case the virus does appear, so it doesn’t spread,” Mayor Martin Walsh said at a press conference. There are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Boston at this time.

Dr. Jennifer Lo, medical director of the Boston Public Health Commission, said the agency is working with Massport on safety protocols at Logan International Airport. Lo said coronavirus symptoms are similar to the flu: “Your best bet, right now, is to protect yourself from the flu and all viruses.”

A total of five people have tested positive for coronavirus in the United States so far and another 73 patients are being tested, according to the CDC. China’s coronavirus death toll has risen to 106, with 2,744 confirmed cases. Cases have been detected in Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, Nepal and France. In China, anyone traveling from Wuhan is now required to register and self-quarantine at home for 14 days — the virus’ incubation period. Two makeshift hospitals with about 1,000 beds each are being built in Wuhan.
