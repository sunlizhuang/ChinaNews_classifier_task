A drugged-up driver who was three times over the limit smashed through the front window of an all-you-can-eat Chinese restaurant.

Jonathan Green, 25, ploughed into the Kowloon restaurant on Smithdown Road, Wavertree, in his friend's high powered Ford Fiesta ST at 9.35pm on July, 18 last year.

Green who was three times over the driving limit with cannabis in his blood, ignored police signals to stop the car and drove straight into the window of the restaurant.

Liverpool Crown Court heard how Green could not remember much about the incident which caused thousands of pounds worth of damage to the restaurant.

The restaurant owner, Yinyin Yan said it was lucky that there were no customers sitting at the front of the premises when the car smashed through the plate glass window.

Green, 25, of Queensland Street, Wavertree, pleaded guilty to driving dangerously, without insurance and a licence.

He was jailed for eight months and banned from driving for three years and four months.

Dramatic pictures taken at the time, show the aftermath of the incident which left the Ford Fiesta embedded into the restaurant window.

Chairs and tables inside the restaurant were broken and police had to block off the road and buses were diverted for some time.

One eyewitness described the sound of the crash as "like a bomb".

Chris Taylor, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court that police officers were on Greenbank Road when they heard “the loud noise of an engine" and turned round and saw the defendant driving the Ford Fiesta ST.

He said: “They saw the lights dip as if (the car was) braking and one officer stood in the road and indicated for the defendant to stop, but he did not slow down and drove past him.

"He then switched his lights off and drove off at speed, overtaking another vehicle on the wrong side of the road.”

The court heard how the officers got back into their patrol car and had to turn it around - by which time they had lost sight of him.

At the junction of Smithdown Road officers saw a fire engine and a lot of people outside the Kowloon Chinese Buffet restaurant.

Mr Taylor, prosecuting, said: “They got there and saw the defendant had driven through the junction at speed and ploughed into the restaurant."

Green fled from the wrecked vehicle but the officers caught him nearby.

He was found to be three times over the limit for driving with cannabis in his blood and said he could not remember much about the incident.

The crash caused thousands of pounds worth of damage to the restaurant which had to close for repairs.

Green, 25, of Queensland Street, Wavertree pleaded guilty to driving dangerously, without insurance and a licence.

He was jailed for eight months and banned from driving for three years four months.

Judge Stuart Driver, QC, told him: ”This was a very bad example of dangerous driving.”

He pointed out that Green had a previous conviction for dangerous driving and a 12-month ban had only finished two months before the incident.

Natalie Byrne, defending, said Green accepted he had demonstrated a poor standard of driving.
