Australia’s first case of the deadly coronavirus has been confirmed in Victoria.

The state health minister Jenny Mikakos on Saturday said a case of the respiratory condition had been confirmed in a man who last week returned from China.

The man, a Chinese national in his 50s, went to a GP on Thursday and to the Monash Medical Centre at Clayton on Friday where he was put into isolation.

He returned a positive test for the virus on Saturday morning. It’s the first confirmed case in Australia.

“There is no reason for alarm in the general community,” Ms Mikakos said.

The man has pneumonia and is in a stable condition, being treated in a negative pressure isolation room, Acting Chief Health Officer Angie Bone said.

The man arrived in Melbourne at 9am on January 19, on a China Southern flight from Guangzhou, and Dr Bone said border screening would not have detected the virus.

Ms Mikakos said all passengers would be contacted out of precaution.

“He did not show any symptoms whilst he was on the fight so it’s possible he wasn’t contagious but there’s a lot we don’t know about this virus at this point,” she said.

The man had been staying with family and had not been out and about so the risk to the broader community was minimised, she added.

Five people are undergoing testing for coronavirus in NSW and two in Queensland.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the arrival of the coronavirus in Australia had been anticipated by authorities.

“Our border authorities and biosecurity officers will be ensuring those flights that are coming from China will be met by our officials,” he said on Saturday

“Our travel advisory is not to travel to Wuhan and Hubei province at all.”

Australia’s Chief medical Officer Brendan Murphy said it was important for people arriving from Wuhan, and those in close contact with them, to monitor for symptoms including fever, cough, sore throat,vomiting and difficulty breathing.

“We don’t know exactly how long symptoms take to show after a person has been infected but there is an incubation period and some patients will have very mild symptoms,” Professor Murphy said.

Yesterday a child was rushed to a Sydney hospital overnight amid fears of having contracted coronavirus.

Health authorities carried out an emergency response at Sydney Airport just before midnight after exhibiting flu-like symptoms on the flight.

Paramedics in protective gear met the child at the airport before rushing them to Sydney Children’s Hospital at Randwick.

The child was later discharged with a clean bill of health.

So far more than 850 people have been infected in China while France has had three people test positive - the disease’s first appearance in Europe.

Two cases, including a Chicago woman returning from China, have been confirmed in the United States.
