Update (1020ET): Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Monday morning that the coronavirus outbreak will definitely impact the Canadian economy, but the extent of the damage isn’t yet clear.

Just minutes later, the WHO started their daily press briefing for Monday by adopting a markedly darker tone. Dr. Tedros, the WHO director-general, said that over the last few days, they’ve seen “concerning incidents” of onward spreading among people with no history of travel to China (including the Brits who were infected at a French chateau).

This “could be the spark that becomes a bigger fire,” Tedros said.

He added that a WHO team of experts is finall on the ground in China to “lay the groundwork” for a larger team that will be studying the outbreak. Here’s a rundown of what the WHO team will be studying in China, courtesy of Reuters.

Their arrival marks the first on-the-ground outside assistance that Beijing has allowed into the country, though we suspect they’ve already been sworn to secrecy and instructed not to expose the real numbers.

Update (0850ET): Carnival cruise’s PR crisis team just hit it out of the park with this one. After the NYT reported on the growing sense of paranoia among the 3,600 people stuck onboard the Diamond Princess – including their ‘deranged conspiracies’ about the virus spreading through their food and air ducts – another passenger participated in a remote live interview on CNBC to defend the cruise line’s handling of the incident.

“I personally believe it’s run very well…getting us into quarantine and keeping us in the cabin as much as possible in the circumstances…the only people they’ve bee letting out are in small groups to get some air.”

“I recognize the situation…I’m maintaining my confidence that they will conclude that we’re asymptomatic and we’ll be allowed to leave after the 14 days.”

“Though after you think about how many days remain…it can get a little depressing.”

“I give Princess Cruises and the captain of this vessel an A++ in handling this.”

In other words, everything is fine. There’s nothing to see here people. Hopefully, if we play ball, the Japanese health officials will take pity on us and let us go after 14 days, instead of keeping us trapped on this ship forever.
