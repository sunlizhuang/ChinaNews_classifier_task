MANILA - PHINMA Education suspended field trips and stepped up hygiene promotion in its network of schools to guard against the new coronavirus strain from China, an official said Wednesday.

Rubbing alcohol and sanitizers were placed in entrances, soaps are always available in restrooms and an awareness campaign on the virus was launched, PHINMA Education COO Raymundo Reyes told ABS-CBN News.

PHINMA's education unit operates 7 schools and 10 campuses nationwide with 74,000 students.

"The health and wellness of our students are paramount...Our number one priority is the safety of our students," said Reyes, who serves as president of 6 schools under the network.

"What we did is also cancel all tours because students have scheduled trips. We have to suspend it first until the situation improves," he added.

Some universities and Filipino-Chinese schools in Metro Manila have suspended classes when the news of the virus broke. Such suspensions are "discouraged" according to the Department of Education.

The virus that originated from Wuhan has infected over 2,000 globally with over 500 deaths mostly in China. There is one recorded death each in the Philippines and Hong Kong.
