A ‘SMALL number’ of Irish people are set to be flown out of the coronavirus-hit region of China.

Those affected will be quarantined for two weeks before they are allowed to come home.

The deadly ‘snake flu’ that originated in Wuhan, China, has already killed more than 130 people and infected more than 6,000.

The Department of Foreign Affairs have been in contact with Irish people living in the infected areas of China.

Tanaiste Simon Coveney yesterday said that a handful of Irish citizens are set to be flown out of the country and put on a two-week quarantine.

He said: “We have a small number of Irish citizens who are in the province that is affected in China.

“We have been in contact with them through our embassy. Some are happy to stay and a very small number want to leave. We are putting arrangements in place to facilitate that and that is likely to happen in the next couple of days.”

He added: “There is no evidence to suggest that any Irish citizen has contracted the virus but of course it is a concern and so we reached out and a small number of Irish citizens expressed the desire to leave.”

Foreign Affairs Minister Coveney said the Irish people living in the infected area of China will be flown out with other EU citizens.

He confirmed that any Irish person leaving the area will go through a 14-day quarantine to ensure they have not picked up the virus before they return home.

Earlier this week, a Chinese student who travelled from Wuhan to Ireland was put in isolation in Waterford as a precautionary measure.

The student left Wuhan days before the city was shut down but did not show any symptoms of the flu.

Some 52 people across Northern Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland have been tested for the deadly flu-like virus.

There are fears the UK could have its first positive test “within days”.
