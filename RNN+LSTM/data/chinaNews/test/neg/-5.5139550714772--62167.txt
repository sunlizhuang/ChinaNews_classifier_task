Scandal is never far away at the London Metal Exchange’s annual jamboree. In 2018 a group of traders drew heavy fire for holding a sleazy cocktail party at the Playboy Club during LME Week, the highlight of the commodities calendar. Last October the hot gossip concerned more businesslike matters. The subject on everyone’s lips was not lap dances but nickel ore. The critical raw material, used to produce electric car batteries and stainless steel, was the talk of the week after Indonesia abruptly brought forward an export ban. Traders boasted about how much money they had made on big deals. The market was gripped with intrigue as stocks of nickel tumbled and prices surged just before the announcement as buyers fought to secure supplies. The aftershocks are still reverberating.

“Nickel is the hype metal right now because of the whole electric vehicle story,” says Guy Wolf, of commodity broker Marex Spectron. “It is prone to people panicking about prices running away from them because of electric cars and the Indonesia ore ban. It was the classic set-up for people to worry if they can get their hands on this.” Yet one major player appeared to have few concerns having made its move early. The Chinese steel powerhouse Tsingshan stockpiled nickel before Indonesia’s export ban, and made massive paper profits as the price leapt. US bank Citigroup in October said the nickel supply squeeze could signal a “Hamanaka moment”, referencing the Sumitomo copper trader Yasuo Hamanaka who at one point held 5pc of world supplies, earning him the nicknames “Mr Copper” and “Mr Five Percent” before he was jailed. Nobody has been accused of any wrongdoing in relation to the recent nickel market.

The LME, home to the last trading pit in Europe where traders bark out bids and offers, nevertheless asked its members for details of nickel trades last October, signalling it was aware of the risk of market manipulation. However it has declined to comment on what was found or if it has since launched a full investigation. The demand for answers is rising. Ore losers? “Nothing is happening. What is the consequence of this [review]? We see nothing – there is silence from the LME, silence from the City watchdog,” says one senior executive in the industry. “Our industry has been tremendously impacted by what is happening in Indonesia.” The subject has become an area of fierce debate in the industry. Veteran metals trader Malcolm Freeman, a director of brokerage Kingdom Futures, accuses European steel producers of complaining because they “missed the boat” and have angry shareholders putting them under pressure. “Losers cry the loudest,” he says. Another metals guru moans that “people do love to blame the bogeyman if they’ve been disadvantaged by a situation”. Jim Lennon, a commodities expert at Macquarie, adds that although in his four decades in the metals industry he has “never seen such a huge inventory move” he does not believe a great mystery needs to be solved. “I’m sure there was strong lobbying from Chinese investors in Indonesia to bring forward the ban, but they didn’t meet in a secret room and not tell anyone. It’s a free world, if you want to buy lots of tickets for the England and Wales rugby game and the prices go up, you can. This is how markets work,” he argues. That’s not how European and US steel producers see it. The price of nickel has returned to more normal levels amid coronavirus fears and dwindling electric car forecasts in the Far East, but some of Tsingshan’s rivals feel there are questions left unanswered.

European fears Some worry for their future in a market heavily influenced by China, fearing they were undercut and left subject to artificially high nickel prices which has hurt their profitability. Tim Di Maulo, the boss of Amsterdam-based steel producer Aperam, last week told investors the business faced its worst ever market conditions in the final months of 2019 due to “unprecedented pricing”. The LME, where traders shout out prices for metals while having to keep their heels on the red leather sofa arranged around the circle, is now facing pressure to take action. The European steel association Eurofer is urging the LME, owned by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and the FCA, the City watchdog, to launch a formal investigation. The stakes are high – experts say that around 55pc of all stainless steel contains nickel and prices are expected to soar due to the rising use of electric cars. “What we’re doing is saying ‘we have enough evidence and we want you guys to get serious about it,’ ” a senior industry insider says. “We are knocking on all doors – for now pricing has come down and on the surface it looks calm, but that’s just on the surface. "We have contacted senior US politicians and car manufacturers, such as Tesla, to get them to bring this issue to Washington.” Senior policymakers are paying attention. The EU filed a World Trade Organisation complaint against Indonesia over its export policies on nickel last November, when commissioner for trade Cecilia Malmström argued that it was impossible to look on and “stay idle” as under-pressure EU steel producers were “suffering from consequences of global overcapacity and unilateral trade restrictions”. Eurofer’s director general Axel Eggert wrote at the time that as many as 200,000 European jobs that depend on stainless steel could be at risk “because of the unfair activities of other countries”.

Collusion concerns Steel producers are concerned that the hugely successful Tsingshan – which has grown significantly since it was set up by a married couple in 2003 – pushed up input prices for other companies by buying huge volumes of nickel ahead of the ban being announced by Indonesia, the largest nickel producer in the world, at the start of September. There is also frustration that the Chinese business has access to cheaper raw materials through its Indonesian nickel mine. “A major beneficiary of the Indonesian export restrictions on nickel has been Tsingshan,” argues Kevin Dempsey, public policy chief for the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). “Indonesia’s market-distorting behaviour thus could ultimately force the shutdown of critical domestic stainless steelmaking operations and leave the US reliant on foreign sources for these critical steel products.” Dempsey explains that stainless steel producers with production facilities in Indonesia have access to nickel at prices “well below the price set on the LME”. He also argues that the “Belt and Road Initiative”, proposed by China in 2013 with the aim of building a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe, could damage overseas competitors. In a recent letter calling on the US government to intervene, the lobby group flagged that one of Tsingshan’s steel plants in Indonesia was “heavily promoted and sponsored by the Indonesian government” and financed by China’s ‘Belt and Road’ programme.

A press release from Tsingshan in July states that its chairman Xiang Guangda had offered “several policy suggestions” to Indonesian president Joko Widodo as they discussed plans for a $15bn (£11.5bn) investment. Cris Fuentes, the chief executive of Kentucky-based North American Stainless, argues that the ban on nickel exports is “just one layer of the unfair practices coming out of Indonesia”. “Beyond artificially limiting the supply of raw materials, Indonesia’s largest stainless steel manufacturer Tsingshan is requesting an exclusion from US tariffs to dump their stainless steel slabs into the US market through a joint venture partner,” he argues. “This is an attempt to destabilise the broader market at multiple levels and is plainly unfair. Like most other producers in the US, we play by the rules, purchasing almost all of our raw materials in the US and on the open, transparent LME and only seek a level playing field for our products.” At the LME, chief executive and former banker Matthew Chamberlain will likely come under mounting pressure to show the findings of the LME’s review to concerned steel producers over the coming months. The European markets watchdog has also urged the FCA to enforce transparency rules for commodity derivatives on the LME. The historic institution has already modernised under Chamberlain’s watch but questions will be raised if it tries to sweep concerns under a carpet.
