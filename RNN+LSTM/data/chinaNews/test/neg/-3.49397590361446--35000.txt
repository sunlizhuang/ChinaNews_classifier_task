The government is working to get more than 600 Australian citizens out of the coronavirus epicentre in China, but it has now been revealed evacuees will have to pay for the trip.

The aim of the “humanitarian” mission is to get people home and into quarantine on Christmas Island and shield mainland Australians at the same time.

Multiple Australians stuck in Wuhan have reportedly been contacted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and given information on what they will need to do to be evacuated, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.

Evacuees have informed the publication they will have to pay $1000 and sign a waiver agreeing to be quarantined on Christmas Island for two weeks.

When the quarantine period finishes the evacuees will then be taken to Perth where they will be left to make their own way back to their homes across the country.

This new information comes after Minister for Foreign Affairs, Marise Payne, said the government has not won the “agreement of Chinese authorities for this process”.

“This is a process we are undertaking with Chinese authorities and as both the prime minister and I indicated yesterday it requires the seeking of formal approval,” she told ABC Radio. “Those discussions are under way through the ministry of foreign affairs and also through our temporary consular team in Wuhan.”

She said the government did not have a consular presence in Wuhan, meaning it was forced to relocate officials from Shanghai.

Greg Hunt said the operation was “humanitarian mission” to protect Australians.

“The government as a matter of national security has to make the call of where. I’m not aware that any state has offered to clear out a hospital for 600 people,” the Health Minister said.

“All states and territories unanimously supported the quarantine procedures given the additional medical advice which has come in overnight from the WHO.”

Also this morning, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton was grilled on the government’s plan.

The island’s detention facilities were reopened last year after the controversial medevac laws were passed against the government’s will, but they were ultimately not used to house asylum seekers medically transferred to Australia.

Yesterday Prime Minister Scott Morrison revealed the government was planning to evacuate Australians from China, and said those people would be required to spend a fortnight in quarantine on the island while being monitored for symptoms of the coronavirus.

“We will be standing up Christmas Island as a quarantine area. They will be transported to Christmas Island, where we’ll also be putting in place the Ozmat team,” Mr Morrison said at a press conference in Canberra.

“I also want to stress that for Christmas Island, we will be ensuring there will be support provided directly to the Christmas Island community, completely separate and quarantined from the support that is being provided in the quarantine zone.”

Mr Dutton appeared on Channel 9’s Today program this morning to discuss the government’s decision. Hosts Allison Langdon and Karl Stefanovic confronted him with criticism from Australian Medical Association President Tony Bartone.

“We have just heard from Dr Bartone from the Australian Medical Association, saying that they’ve not been consulted on this and that we need to find a more humane solution. What is your response?” she asked.

“Look, Tony is a very decent guy and a great doctor and obviously the AMA has had a longstanding position opposing Christmas Island. So I think that is an issue really that’s in the past, and the fact is we need to find a facility that can accommodate in the order of 500, 600 people. We want to make sure that we’re protecting Australians both offshore and here as well,” Mr Dutton said.

“People are there for a maximum of 14 days whilst observations take place. Obviously there are medical facilities on Christmas Island. People will be isolated from the other Christmas Island community.”

He said the government had made its decision in consultation with Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy, who has been in constant contact with the World Health Organisation.

“So there’s an enormous amount of consultation and advice that’s taken in relation to these matters, and I think it’s a sensible decision,” he said.

“Do you think you’re going to have many takers for the evacuation – trading a quarantine zone of a deadly virus for a hell hole?” the hosts asked.

“We have said to people before, and we will repeat it again now, we want to provide support to those who want to get out,” said Mr Dutton.

“There will be some citizens who are long term residents in Wuhan province, and they will make a decision as to whether or not they want to leave.

“Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on facilities, immigration detention centres around the country, and I think Christmas Island and the facilities there are somehow different to your file footage, compared to what it was 10 years ago.

“The fact is though, as you point out, I can’t clear a hospital in Sydney or Melbourne to accommodate 600 people. We don’t have a facility otherwise that can take this number of people. I want to make sure that we keep Australians safe.

“We want to help people out of a difficult situation but we don’t want to inadvertently put Australians here at home at risk either.”

Langdon then read out a text that was sent to the ABC last night by Christmas Island Shire President Gordon Thomson. Mr Thomson claimed he only learned of the government’s quarantine plan through SBS News yesterday.

“Saw PM’s announcement via SBS. Regressive colonial era ideas since 2001. Create convict settlement for innocent people, now we’ll be a leper colony,” he texted.

As Langdon finished reading out the quote, Mr Dutton interjected.

“We saw with the bushfires crisis, when you -” she started to say.

“Sorry, Ally, Gordon of course is the local president of the Labor Party. And he has been opposed to offshore processing from day one,” he said.

“Can I just make this point though?” Langdon responded.

“That the people of Christmas Island and the West Australian government, which runs the island, didn’t know about this plan until they heard it in the media. We saw this with the bushfires, when Scott Morrison said the military is going to help. A great announcement, but he hadn’t told the fire chief. There needs to be better communication.”

“The only reason I am interrupting you is that is not correct,” said Mr Dutton.

“Mr Thomson was called before the announcement. He is on holidays in Malaysia and we could only get his voicemail. We couldn’t make contact with his office.”

“Was the WA government told?” Langdon asked.

“Well, Natasha Griggs, who is otherwise the on island representative, was advised before the Prime Minister’s announcement put out information,” he replied.

Ms Griggs is the government-appointed administrator of Christmas Island.

“Look, the Labor Party of course will criticise,” Mr Dutton continued.

“We are not utilising any WA resources. We don’t want people going to Christmas Island medical centres or health facilities. We are isolating people within the assets of the Commonwealth government, and for the WA Premier to be out there making political points, and Gordon Thomson as a Labor Party member as well making points off the back of a significant crisis, I think reflects more on them than on Scott Morrison or anyone else.”

The interview ended on cordial terms as Langdon acknowledged the coronavirus situation was a “very difficult” one to manage.

“Thank you for your time. It is a very difficult issue to navigate. We appreciate that, and we appreciate your time this morning,” she said.

‘GOBSMACKED’ LOCALS DEMAND ANSWERS

Mr Thomson bluntly told the Prime Minister to “get lost” when he spoke to ABC News.

“Christmas Island remains a colony and is yet again getting the old regressive colonialist treatment from the great colonial power. Get lost, Scotty,” he said.

West Australian Premier Mark McGowan was also caught off-guard, commenting to reporters on Wednesday: “You would think we might have been advised”.

Christmas Island locals are now demanding more information about the plan as they prepare for the newcomers.

Less than 2000 people live on the island, and Chris Bray, the owner of luxury eco-resort Swell Lodge, said questions were “flying around the community”.

“It would be irresponsible for the Government not to provide all the answers,” he said.

On Facebook, residents threw questions at Natasha Griggs, the administrator of the Christmas and Cocos Islands, hoping she could offer more detail.

“Will there be an information bulletin provided for CI residents?” Robyn Stephenson wrote.

“The Prime Minister’s statement is broad and sweeping with little operational detail. People are understandably worried about the logistics of the operation and how they will be impacted.”

“How will the Australian Government ensure separation between the general population and those working within quarantine zones?” Alexander Jansen asked.

“Workers will be coming here next month and are justifiably worried about whether they should come.”

Ms Griggs said she would try to keep residents updated as more information became available.

“I absolutely understand people’s concerns. I want to make sure the information I share with everyone is accurate and informative. Thanks for your patience and understanding,” she said.

Small business owner Sharon Tisdale, who has lived on the island for 13 years, told The Australian she was “gobsmacked”.

“The island is just getting back on its feet,” she said.

ISLAND’S COMPLEX HISTORY

The quarantine plan is just the latest chapter in Christmas Island’s complex history.

Britain took possession of the island in 1888 to get hold of its phosphate deposits and brought in a workforce of Chinese, Malays and Sikhs, who often suffered appalling conditions.

Japan then invaded in 1942, attracted by its fertiliser and strategic location.

After WWII ended in 1945, the island was reoccupied by Britain, who handed administrative responsibility over to Singapore in 1949 and then transferred sovereignty to Australia in 1958.

Christmas Island’s closeness to Indonesia led to the arrival of boats carrying asylum seekers from the late 1980s.

Construction of an immigration detention centre was then completed in 2008, where there were several detainee riots over the next few years.

The centre closed in 2018. But after laws allowing for the medical evacuation of asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru were passed against the Government’s wishes, the centre was reopened in 2019 for $185 million.

A Sri Lankan family, Priya and Nades Murugappan, and their Australian-born daughters Kopika and Tharunicaa, have been in detention at the centre since mid-2019.

A proposal to expand phosphate mining operations on the island was rejected in 2018 for environmental reasons, leaving locals desperately hoping tourism will expand beyond those who come to see the island’s unique birds and crabs.
