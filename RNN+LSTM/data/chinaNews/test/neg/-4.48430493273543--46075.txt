With worries about a novel coronavirus first identified in China continuing to grow, the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) has released screening and assessment guidelines for Iowa health care facilities. There have been five confirmed cases identified in the United States to date, all in travelers returning from Wuhan, China. No cases have been identified in Iowa. State health officials are encouraging providers to include new screening questions during patient intake to determine the potential for coronavirus infection and ask any for suspected cases be referred to the IDPH. Investigators originally believed the virus was spread from animal-to-person contact, but there have since been confirmed cases of person-to-person transmission. The IDPH and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are closely monitoring the situation, and State Epidemiologist, Dr. Caitlin Pedati, indicated there is little reason for Iowans to be concerned. There are seven varieties of coronavirus that can circulate in humans. Generally, they cause only mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses similar to the common cold. However, three rarer types, including the novel virus associated with the outbreak in China, cause more severe symptoms that can lead to pneumonia and life-threatening illness.
