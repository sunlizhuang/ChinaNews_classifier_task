Introduction by Kevin Barrett, Veterans Today Editor

Trump lured the martyred Gen. Qassem Soleimani to Baghdad with a peace conference—then murdered him in cold blood. A more dastardly, cowardly act could scarcely be imagined. And since Trump was following Bibi’s orders, ambushing Soleimani was also an act of treason.

But maybe Trump is so bad he’s good. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad recently said, Trump is the best alternative for US president “because he is the most transparent… [not] that he is good; but transparency is a good thing especially when it comes to Western politics because we have become accustomed to masks that hide real Western intentions regarding the world.”

The famously narcissistic Trump would probably take that as a compliment. But al-Asad’s real meaning, of course, is that Trump plays the role of the proverbial ugly American quite transparently; he is a transparent idiot, sociopath, and war criminal.

A new furqan— stark, clear, and unmistakeable division between good and evil—has arrived. The demonic narcissist Trump, juxtaposed with the saintly Gen. Soleimani, creates the most stunningly memorable contrast of darkness and light since the heyday of chiaroscuro.

Suddenly Muslims and others from all backgrounds are forgetting their petty quarrels and uniting behind the memory of Gen. Soleimani. The result could be momentous.

The Muslim world’s great task in this age is to liberate the Holy Places from the Zionist Antichrist. The liberating armies will include Muslims from all ethnicities and Islamic schools of thought, as well as many Christians who have awakened to the reality of who Antichrist really is. (Hint: He’s from, and represents, the tribe that reviled and still reviles Jesus as the bastard son of a prostitute. That tribe is NOT the Muslims, who love and revere Jesus and know that he is Messiah.)

The liberating armies will not only be waving the “Black Flag of Khorasan” (the real one, not the disgusting ISIS counterfeit), they will also be brandishing mementos of the martyred Gen. Soleimani.

Below are articles from two esteemed Muslim colleagues on the import of the martyrdom of Soleimani.

“I’m for truth, no matter who tells it. I’m for justice, no matter who it is for or against. I’m a human being first and foremost, and as such I’m for whoever and whatever benefits humanity as a whole.”

— The Unknown Transformation of Malcolm X

Today, January 6th, 2020, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution led the funeral prayer for the honorable martyrs Haj Qasem Soleimani, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and the other martyrs of the cowardly US assassination ordered by “Christian”-Zionist American President Donald Trump, amidst shrill Persian cries of Inteqaam – revenge, revenge, revenge – resonating in Iran from street to street and home to home in teary-eyed mega funeral processions the likes of which have never been witnessed in any other Muslim country. (And in any Western country for that matter, including in the most dignified funeral procession of President Kennedy who was assassinated in the United States by the United States.) As a child, I watched the newsreel of that funeral procession in 1963.

I still remember the poise and somber behavior of Mrs. Kennedy and her children holding her hand, and the silence of the American public during the short procession and funeral service — and who quickly forgot all about it in their unbridled pursuit of the American Dream. The 3-day mourning and long funeral in Iran and Iraq express a personal tragedy of every Iranian, Iraqi, and every Muslim who understands what General Qasem Soleimani did to defeat Daeesh, ISIS, the American-Israeli concoction created in the name of Islam to wreak havoc upon Muslims (see Understanding ISIS by Zahir Ebrahim).

The West shall never understand the phenomenon being witnessed in Iran. But Western leaders, whether or not they understand it, ought not to underestimate it. Iranians shall never forget this cold-blooded murder of their General which, to every Muslim who perceptively understands his or her religion and the tragedy of Karbala, is akin to the assassinations of Imam Ali (the one who protected Islam and the Prophet of Islam in its early days) and Imam Hussein (the one who protected Islam during its early decay into a world empire).

The Iranian General played a similar role in protecting not just Iran from American-Zionist aggression, but the sanctity of Islam by destroying Daeesh. Iranians, and all those who understand what really transpired in Iraq and Syria and in the manufactured arc of crisis, shall never forgive that murder.

Iran is unlike any other nation on earth. With the rest of the world on one side, Iran on the other can withstand the entire world and die happily in the process. Why? Because Muslims have heroes in Islam such as Imam Hussein (as) – who lived and died the edict: Death with honor is preferred to live with indignity.

One can hear this religious slogan – Islam’s principled teaching – being chanted in Arabic in the background through loudspeakers throughout the funeral procession. Iran embodies that ethos more than any other Muslim nation and their four decades of principled resistance to the United States aggression is testimony to that fact. While the United States of America is all-powerful today, full of the same hubris that afflict all taghoots — they and their Allies shall go down in history no differently than the Third Reich and its allies.

﻿

Today, in these times of universal deceit and universal tyranny that invites the uncultivated mind to love its own servitude, making that bold statement may be hazardous to one’s pursuit of life liberty and happiness.

Not making it, however, is a sure way of having that destiny actually come to pass. It is as much in the interest of the people of the United States to rein in the aggression of their rulers, and to force their deep state to rein in its primacy instincts as its god-given geostrategic imperative (see Zbigniew Brzezinski’s The Grand Chessboard – American Primacy And Its Geostrategic Imperatives, 1996), as it is in the interest of all Muslim nations for the Iranians to temper their desire for revenge against the injustice they suffered in this assassination in the long chain of injustices throughout the twentieth century, and which can set the arc of crisis on fire far beyond the fires we have seen diabolically lighted since 9/11 (see Unlayering the Middle East War Agenda: Making Sense of Absurdities Jan 23, 2011).

However, death with honor is always better than life in servitude, and that was once the rallying cry of the American colonists as well which won them their freedom from the previous evil empire, only to become the new evil empire…

While today it is the rallying cry among the 80 million in Iran borne from the ethos of Karbala and Imam Hussein, the West be advised that it can quickly become the rallying cry of the 1.8 billion Muslims worldwide, finally uniting Shia and Sunni Muslims against the common enemy of mankind in an Armageddon-like scenario.

The emergence of the new ruling state of Israel (see Israel: The New Ruling State’s War On Iran in 2019? and The New Ruling State in the World: Eretz Yisrael ) is predicated on lighting that arc of crisis with Muslim-Christian blood that shall engulf and destroy not just the sole superpower and its already waning preeminence, but all Eurasian Christian power as well, to create a new world superstate in the form of world government to be administered from Jerusalem. All of us goys, including the children of America, shall be in service to the new masters as the revenge of 2000 years of persecution (see Rise of the Fourth Reich in America – Revenge of the Judeofascist-Zionofascist cabal).

Its interdiction is now… and Iran shall wisely play its role of exercising sabr (patience) in averting it (at least in the near term) by reining in their national emotions with wisdom.

Project Humanbeingsfirst makes the following public statement – and this was submitted to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution’s website.

Comment submitted by Zahir Ebrahim | Project Humanbeingsfirst.org, USA

Today, January 06, 2020, I am an Iranian. I feel the pain of Iran. My condolence to the family and nation of this noble and skillful warrior of Imam Ali (as). Remember that Imam Ali was also assassinated, and Imam Hussein in the most inhuman way. Let’s learn from the Imams of Ahlul Bayt who refrained from Inteqaam. 1) During the time of the Caliphate, Imam did not call for Inteqaam for the death of his wife Fatima-tus-Zahra (Salam-ullah Alahe). 2) During his own reign as Caliph, Imam Ali drew his sword against all the munafiqeen who came against him (munafiqeen, by definition, are Muslims). 3) Imam Hussein and Karbala are a moral imperative. 4) The Prophet and early Muslims drew their swords in self-defense against the kuffar aggressors. What we are faced with today is a combination of all four. Inteqaam — against whom? It can lead to internecine Muslim warfare. As a Muslim, I am for justice. Inteqaam of Iran shall lead to entire nations destroyed. Is that justice?

Thank you.

Qassem Soleimani’s Assassination and Lessons for the Muslim World

By Sabtain Ahmed Dar

General Qassem Soleimani, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps’ Quds Force was deliberately assassinated by the United States in Baghdad in an attempt to incite sectarian violence and destroy Iran and Saudi Arabia’s détente to the strategic advantage of pro-Israel US foreign policy in the Middle East.

General Qassem Soleimani was arguably the most formidable personality in the region. He was responsible for resistance in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. He fought tirelessly and effectively to eliminate ISIS from the Levant.

His assassination by the US has not only set a unique precedent in international relations but is also in line with the interests of the terrorist organizations that have been tarnishing the sovereignty of Muslim states in the Middle East.

This crisis is the direct result of Tehran’s decision on the nuclear deal in 2015 which opened a loophole in Iranian strategy and allowed US exploitation that has never been in line with International Law.

On 31st December 2019, the Trump administration without any proof blamed Soleimani for PMU protests that took place in front of the US embassy in Baghdad.

On 5th January, the Prime Minister of Iraq, Adil Abdul Mahdi, provided additional details on the US assassination of Gen. Qassem Soleimani. According to available reports, PM Mahdi himself called Soleimani for an official visit to Baghdad for deescalating tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

Soleimani was set to receive de-escalation proposals from Saudi Arabia via Iraq. Mike Pompeo allegedly supported the idea on a phone call with PM Mahdi amid PMU protests in Baghdad.

Therefore, to sabotage the peace initiative between Iran and Saudi Arabia which could have led to the end of anarchy, the US set up Soleimani and killed him.

Since April 2019 officials from Turkey and Syria were engaging Iran and Saudi Arabia in Baghdad to restore order in the Middle East. According to my analysis, Trump gave the assassination order at the behest of Israel lobby in the US with its policy of divide and conquer to serve its strategic objectives of the New Middle East Project.

There is no more plausible explanation than the aforementioned analysis; because the whole US-Israel strategy of warfare in the Middle East is systematically sustained on the Iran and Saudi Arabia divide.

Only this way can they intimidate and engage nuclear Pakistan and the rest of the Muslim nations into the conflicts that they have been creating in the post-911 world order. With the US assassination of Soleimani, the Muslim World is now forced to face new challenges.

These challenges are hybrid and deceptive in nature, and they need to be decoded firmly to counter the effect created by the United States and Israel Lobby from the backdoor. Let us first start with an analysis of military buildup and war scenarios.

War Scenario: Analyzing Anarchy

The conventional military confrontation between the US and Iran can provoke a major war because it will engage almost all the major powers and their proxies due to Iran’s geographical position. But why we are talking about war when we know that war does not determine who is right but only who is left?

Firstly, we are talking about war because we have been fed it by the framing of international media.

Secondly, for any sane military strategist, war has always been a “lose-lose” option for all.

Thirdly, there is no conventional “Iranian Threat” to the sovereignty of the United States across the Atlantic Ocean but only to Israel in the Middle East. Israel feels threatened and has a great influence on the power structure of the United States.

The study of history has taught us that Israel does not hesitate to use the US Army and its coalition to serve her foreign policy objectives in the Greater Middle East.

Most importantly, it is not the Americans who want war with the Muslim World; it is the people who control Israel and have a profound influence on the US who are perpetually destabilizing the Middle East.

The Military Buildup. Before commencing into details about the US military buildup, it is of utmost importance to analyze the efficacy of the notion of “Corporate War Theories”. Wars, specifically in the Middle East have nothing to do with the capture of wealth and resources, these wars are purely based on ideological grounds.

There is no cost for the United States when it comes to war; they can create money out of thin air anytime they want through credit creation.

From the herald of Bush’s Crusade against Islam, Ralph Peters’ “Shia-Sunni” (blood borders) map and to the current hybrid war scenario, these conflicts are based on deep ideological vengeance.

Is it merely an accident that Trump used the figure of 52 to target Iranian sites? A: There are no accidents in the language of International Relations, everything is highly organized and constructed. The United States was giving a symbolic message to Iran in the context of the hostage crisis of 1979 when Iran held 52 American hostages.

Every engineered conflict in the Middle East has caused the rise of foreign armies on the Muslim lands. Similarly, the conventional US military buildup in recent times in the Gulf is also of grave significance.

Mystifyingly, the drum beating for war in the Gulf has become a global trend in the past few months. The Strait of Hormuz is most arguably the most significant oil chokepoint in the world because of more than 21 million barrels per day flow through it. That is equal to almost ¼ of global petroleum consumption.

Oil tankers have been mysteriously destroyed; Iran and Saudi Arabia are pitted against each other. A US surveillance drone was shot down by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) in June 2019.

Missiles have targeted Saudi installations and Basra sites since last year. Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for an attack on the kingdom’s oil facilities. The US cunningly supported Saudi Arabia against Iran.

The US instantly came with its naval armada and 2,500 troops in the Gulf which has escalated economic pressure and is building a scenario of a conventional attack against Iran.

Now immediately after killing Soleimani, there is a report on the US planning to send 3,000 additional troops to the Middle East from the 82nd Airborne Division as a precaution amid rising threats to US forces in the region. If this is not pointing to war then what will?

The Choke Point. Firstly, the most important factor in analyzing the current war scenario is a militarization of the Strait of Hormuz. The saturation of conventional US military assets in Hormuz is directly threatening the sovereignty of Iran and raising concerns for regional powers. It is the most potent location on the world map where you can trigger a major war between the major powers by just blocking it.

Secondly, it is of grave importance that we must study and see the implications which might follow if Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia are isolated and militarily pitted against each other in this hybrid conflict created by the US and Israel from the back door.

It would create a dangerous situation for the Muslims around the world where nationalist geographical lines would not be able to stop the anarchy. It would also create a choke point where Muslims themselves become the cause of their suicide.

Early protests in Pakistan and other Muslim states around the region are a key indicator of this notion that the Shia-Sunni paradigm which is gaining heat after Soleimani’s assassination can prove to be fatal for the statecraft and sovereignty of the Muslim republics.

This can be an end game that Israel would love to see if everything goes according to the plan. Apparently, Soleimani’s assassination has nothing to do with Saudi Arabia. But, the options Iran might follow in retaliation to the US can end up triggering a conflict that would pave the way for this unwanted crisis. Here is how;

Trump has refused to pull out US troops from Iraq, indicating that they will not incline to peace and reciprocate. At the outset, this conflict is limited but it could escalate rapidly in case of any miscalculation. For example;

1- Militias attacks against US personnel and installations in Saudi Arabia and the Levant.

2- US retaliation against Iranian gunboats and naval vessels.

3- US retaliation against 52 Iranian cultural sites.

4- Iranian missile strikes against US targets.

5- Missile and rocket attacks against Israel and occupied territories by Hezbollah and allies.

6- US and Israel can resort to pre-emptive aerial strikes to destroy Iran’s missile and naval prowess.

However, even if such aerial strikes are successful, Iran is unlikely to yield because of its military prowess. Trump earlier announced that the US does not seek regime change in Iran, but in an effort to win the conflict Trump will have no option but to strike Tehran with full force and replace the Iranian regime.

In the case of this external attack, it is unlikely that there will be any popular movement in Iran to replace the regime since Soleimani’s assassination has completely shut the door for any color revolution application. Thus, to completely sabotage the Tehran administration, the United States and its coalition will have to launch an all-out invasion of Iran.

Having case studies of the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003, it is an impossible idea to conceive for any military strategist that the US and its regional allies would have the stomach for a full-fledged invasion of Iran. So the question is; what are US and Israeli military strategists planning?

The Domino Effect. Iran’s tilt towards major powers such as Russia and China is essential to understand the future implications of the US and Iran military confrontation. A conflict with Iran effectively conflicts with Russia and China. And soon they can be forced to enter into the crisis which can trigger a domino effect that would engulf the entire region into anarchy.

The United States at the behest of Israel Lobby has been baiting the Russians, and China too. In line with the case studies of Libya and Syria, it is my assessment that Iran must not trust Russia and China in any military engagement with the US. Russia and China betrayed the Libyans in 2011. They conspiratorially abstained in the UN Security Council and partnered with the US from the back door which allowed NATO airstrikes in Libya.

Even if US rivals Russia and China did not intervene directly or indirectly, on Iran’s behalf, the end game of war with Iran will end up in catastrophe for Iran and other regional countries;

1- The rise of anarchy in Iran with the eruption of ethno-sectarian insurgencies.

2- A war by Iranian forces and Shia militias against US and allied forces and installations in Saudi Arabia (indirectly pitting Tehran and Riyadh against each other).

3- Iran’s initiative of intensification of the conflicts in Levant, Yemen, and Afghanistan.

4- Iranian denunciation of the nuclear deal, nuclear non-proliferation treaty and eventual development of nuclear weapons.

5- A major hiatus in oil exports from the Gulf, skyrocketing prices to new heights.

6- The crash of Stock Markets around the world and a global economic recession.

The Patterns of Propaganda. Firstly, as stated above, this conflict is seemingly limited to Iran and the US but on the other hand, the patterns of propaganda are also hinting towards an international conspiracy.

India, the most strategic ally of Israel after the United States, is leading propaganda that Pakistan has ditched Iran amid Soleimani’s assassination. It is indeed an attempt to incite sectarian violence within Pakistan and raise the level of confusion between Tehran and Islamabad.

The spokesperson of the Pakistan Army, DG ISPR Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor has clarified and warned the public and media about Indian propaganda. Emphasizing Pakistan’s stance, ISPR said; “Pakistan has eliminated terrorism and will not allow its territory to be used against anyone”.

Secondly, on 4th January amid rising tensions, Trump claimed that Soleimani was also responsible for terror plots in 2012 in New Delhi. Why Trump is binding India into this conflict with Iran? Is there a larger agenda behind this?

The author in one of his articles on the balancing strategy in the Middle East predicted that it is in the interest of the state of Israel if India being her ally raises its stakes in the Middle East.

The author concluded that after Chahbahar port, Indian Reliance Group’s multi-billion engagement with Saudi Aramco and India’s security cooperation with Israel at the same time is hinting towards a new scenario in the geopolitics of the Middle East.

Is India planning to extend its influence in the Middle East with Israel and the US on its back? What if tomorrow’s Indian assets in Iran and Saudi Arabia are attacked by terrorists? These questions still need to be seen for further analysis and a nuclear Pakistan should be concerned about it.

The Pakistan Connection. Pakistan’s threat analysis since 2001 is clear in the context of the US war on terrorism. Pakistan does not consider the presence of the US Army, its coalition and Indian forces in Afghanistan as legit. In the context of Pakistan’s security analysis, the war on terror is a giant hoax that is used as a cover not only to defame Islam but also destabilize Pakistan through hybrid warfare in an attempt to denuclearize it.

A nuclear Pakistan is a huge obstacle to Israel’s quest for Holy Land. With the military buildup since 2001 in Afghanistan, border skirmishes and limited aerial engagements with India on the eastern side and now saturation of naval forces in the Gulf raises serious concerns for Pakistan. Neither Pakistan can afford a military confrontation of Iran and the United States nor can it take sides in this conflict.

In the context of Israel Lobby’s new Middle Eastern Project, Tel Aviv would not hesitate to use Indian forces to target Pakistan from the eastern side amid Iran’s US military confrontation. In fact, Pakistan must take diplomatic measures along with Turkey to use this crisis as an opportunity and bring about peace between Iran and Saudi Arabia and end the spell of the Sunni-Shia divide.

Peace Scenario: Balancing Anarchy

War is indeed a ‘lose-lose’ option for all. It is true that the principle of “Might is Right” exists at the center stage of this global order and determines its movement. A world where justice has replaced the power and the end justifies means regardless of who is good and who is evil. Even then, common sense and a sense of self-preservation should be used to bring about order.

A first step away from the brink should be lobbying at the UN to demand general assembly a proposal to hold an independent inquiry into Soleimani’s assassination. Muslim leaders must lobby major powers and urge the United Nations Security Council to arrange an urgent meeting to demand;

1- Elimination of US troops from the Levant and let Muslim national armies eliminate terrorists.

2- End to Houthi missile attacks against Saudi Arabia and Emerati targets.

3- Ceasefire in Yemen.

4- Opening of all avenues for the supply of humanitarian aid to Yemen.

5- A series of summit-level dialogue between Iran and Saudi Arabia to resolve issues.
