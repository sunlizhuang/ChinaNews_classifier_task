He also took aim at Minister for Health Dr David Clark.

"He's not dealing with it - the reality is we haven't heard from David Clark here. He needs to step up [and] reassure the public that the ministry and health authorities do have this in hand, and there are steps we can take to manage the risk.

"It absolutely flummoxes me why sensible steps have not been taken to manage the risk, it's not as if this is novel. We've had several outbreaks like this in our global community in the last 15 to 20 years - we know what to do."

The MP said a passenger, who travelled from China to Auckland last night, reported to him that nearly everyone onboard were wearing masks as a precautionary measure - and were expecting more information on arrival.

"When they arrived at Auckland Airport, they were expecting to be screened and have information provided to them - there was none. I understand there is a small amount of information in Chinese at Auckland Airport, but of course we live in a global world," Woodhouse said.

"Certainly they should be screened for symptoms... information to passengers to be alert for signs and symptoms... and what to do if they do display those symptoms would be the number one priority. Certainly there can be questions at the border about whether people do feel unwell... and medical support available to them if they report those symptoms.

"They would be very practical, straightforward and not resource-intensive steps."

Shortly after Woodhouse's conference, Dr Clark released a statement announcing that the Government has convened the Interagency Pandemic Group and health staff to meet flights from China, alongside additional measures following the arrival of the disease in Australia.

"I'm advised that the risk of an outbreak in New Zealand remains low, but we are increasing our health response at the border as a precaution," Clark said in a statement.

"Health officials began preparations for placing staff at our major airports last week, and we will have that in place for all flights from China tomorrow."
