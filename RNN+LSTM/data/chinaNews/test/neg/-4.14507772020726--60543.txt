Public health experts gathered in New Orleans on Friday to discuss how to respond to coronavirus if it comes to Louisiana.

While coronavirus has not been detected in the state, it has quickly spread internationally, alerting people who have studied similar outbreaks in the past.

“As you all know, it took off like wildfire,” Dr. Joanne Maffei, an infectious disease specialist, told a room of medical professionals at the Louisiana State University School of Medicine.

The first documented coronavirus patient came into a hospital in China with symptoms on Dec. 21. From Monday to Friday of this week, the number of infected people jumped from around 20,000 to over 31,500. In total, 638 people, mostly in China, have died from the illness, which causes symptoms such as fever, cough and fatigue.

There are currently 12 confirmed cases in the U.S. Ten of those people had traveled from China; the other two were spouses of those travelers.

“All 12 of those individuals, clinically, are doing quite well,” said Dr. Joe Kanter, the assistant state health officer of Louisiana.

The first U.S. patient was given a respiratory virus drug called remdisivir, manufactured by American drug giant Gilead. It is currently being tested in a new clinical trial in China. The drug is not specifically aimed at treating coronavirus, but it was approved for compassionate use in the U.S. patient’s case. The patient improved after being given the drug and had no negative reactions.

University Medical Center in New Orleans had a false alarm of one patient with suspected coronavirus. But the patient did not fit the criteria for testing.

“We had a plan in place,” said Maffei. “It was a great drill for us and told us that the plan works.”

Currently, only U.S. citizens and permanent residents and their relatives can enter the U.S. if they’ve visited China in the last 14 days. This week, two flights left Wuhan for the U.S. with around 550 American citizens. Those people will be quarantined for 14 days in California.

A professor at the Loyola University School of Law was one of those evacuees, according to reports. Chunlin Leonhard, 55, was spending a year in China on a Fulbright scholarship and traveled to a city in Hubei province, about 250 miles from Wuhan, on Jan. 20.

Leonhard has not shown symptoms but is under the 14-day quarantine.

In an email sent to faculty and students on Friday, Loyola President Tania Tetlow said Leonhard "remains cheerful and continues her scholarship and research of ancient Chinese law, even while in quarantine."

The email said the law school faculty and staff have been in "constant contact" with Leonhard as she waits to be cleared for travel.

There are some people in Louisiana who traveled from China during the course of this outbreak, said Kanter. They are being monitored and are in contact with the Department of Health.

“We have zero patients under investigation in Louisiana. We’ve had a lot of clinicians reach out with suspected cases, but none of them met the bar,” said Kanter.

With so few people coming in from the outbreak’s epicenter, increased travel to and from New Orleans during Carnival is not currently a concern for officials.

Speakers emphasized that the flu is still a bigger concern and said people should practice good hand hygiene and cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.

“Just to put this outbreak in context, we’re still in the middle of flu season,” said Kanter. “Last year … there were 1,500 deaths in Louisiana and 15,000 hospitalizations (from the flu). That’s really where people’s focus should be, even though this is frightening.”
