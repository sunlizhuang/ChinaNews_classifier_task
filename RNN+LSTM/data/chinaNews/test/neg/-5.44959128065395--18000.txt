Operation Chrome Dome was a secret US Air Force Cold War mission during the Sixties in which B-52 strategic bombers armed with thermonuclear weapons remained on continuous airborne alert around the border of the USSR, to provide rapid first strike or retaliation capability in case of nuclear war. During the eight-year programme, there were five known nuclear weapons accidents, including the Savage Mountain crash of 1964. This incident, which came just two years after the Cuban Missile Crisis pushed World War 3 tensions to the brink, saw the bomber’s vertical stabiliser break off during a winter storm near Maryland as it set out to circumnavigate the Soviet border.

The crew were forced to bail from the aircraft, which was carrying two Mark 53 nuclear bombs, before it crashed into Savage Mountain, Garrett County. Co-pilot, Captain Parker Peedin, relived the moment all hell broke loose during Peter Kuran’s film “Nuclear 911 – Broken Arrows”. He said in 2013: “The aircraft was flown by another crew and they developed an in-flight mechanical problem with the aircraft. “They diverted it into a base in Massachusetts and rounded-up my crew to return the plane.

A bailout command was ordered and pretty much chaos ensued Captain Parker Peedin

“We planned our route and the weather was forecasted to be quite good for some areas of rain and snow, but the altitudes we were at we expected to be in the clear. “We encounter this area of moderate turbulence and requested to change altitude to get to smoother conditions, but while we were effecting that change, the turbulence became severe.” Captain Peedin explained the moment the crew had to bail. He added: “I remember having a clear thought ‘I think I’ve still got it’ and then it became completely uncontrollable and inverted. “A bailout command was ordered and pretty much chaos ensued because everything not fastened down departs.

Captain Parker Peedin speaking in 2013

“All of a sudden, you go from a warm, comfortable cabin almost instantaneously into a really harsh outside element with the wind fully in your face, travelling at 500mph, your adrenaline is pumping, but you are frightened. “We hit the ground and came through this small tree, your first instinct is to get help, you want to grab somebody and say ‘help me’. “The mechanical struggle of trying to get out of a parachute made me begin to realise 'I must survive, help will be here if you survive.'” Captain Peedin then spent two days in sub-zero temperatures, until he was found by a search crew of locals.

He continued: “Next day I was able to get a portion of the parachute out of the tree and construct a shelter and dig down into the snow so I could get the sleeping bag on the ground. “I felt certain that a search aircraft was airborne and looking, but I also knew they would not be able to operate in the mountains below the clouds, so I resigned myself to believing they would not find me that day, I had to survive. “Major (Thomas) McCormick was the first one found, during his descent he was able to see the lights from a farmhouse and the next morning he made his way there. “While I was in the hospital they found two of the other three and one was not found until after I left the hospital, three more died.”
