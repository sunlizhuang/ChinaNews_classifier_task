OTTAWA, Ont. – The federal government is seeking to reassure Canadians that the risk of contracting coronavirus remains very low, after the country’s first presumed case of the virus was announced Saturday. Health officials gave additional details on the case, and the government’s response, at a Sunday morning press conference.

Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer, Theresa Tam, says the Toronto man is believed to have contracted the virus on a recent visit to the Wuhan region in China. He returned on China Southern flight 311 on Jan. 22, and reported symptoms to authorities shortly afterwards.

Based on the latest evidence shared between countries and the World Health Organization, Tam says the virus is spread through close personal contact. She says the government will be contacting fellow passengers on the flight who are believed to have been within a 2 metre radius of the patient, but other have little cause to worry.

Canada has implemented enhanced screening for those travelling from the Wuhan region at the Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver international airports, and is offering information on what to do for those experiencing possible symptoms after their return. Tam says given the low level of risk, there are no plans to step up that screening to include more extreme measures like quarantine zones or temperature checks.

Health Minister and Thunder Bay MP Patty Hajdu says the Toronto man alerted first responders that he had recently returned from Wuhan when he reported his symptoms.

“For me that is a sign that the information at the border did actually percolate through to the patient and his family,” she says.

Hajdu emphasizes that Canadians shouldn't be overly concerned about risks from the virus.

“There is no need for Canadians to be alarmed that they will contract the virus in a casual setting," she said. "The risk remains low, and people should continue their lives.”

The novel coronavirus has so far infected more than 2,000 people and killed more than 50, largely in Wuhan and the surrounding region. However, cases have been reported in a growing number of countries around the world in recent days, including Japan, Australia, France, and the United States.

Hajdu says lessons learned after the SARS outbreak nearly two decades ago mean the country is well-prepared to respond to outbreaks like this one.

“As a country, we’ve learned a lot since the SARS outbreak in 2003, and this has allowed all levels of govt to work very closely with each other to ensure that we’re prepared,” Hajdu said.

She expects confirmation of the suspected case within the next day from Canada’s national microbiology laboratory.
