A British grandmother is stuck in the Chinese city of Wuhan after it was put on lockdown following the coronavirus outbreak.

Veronica Theobald was due to fly home from the city, where she was visiting her grandson Kharn Lambert, on Monday but her return was cancelled after it was put on lockdown.

The 81-year-old from Lancaster, who suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is now running out of medication and has not left the house where she is staying for more than a week for fear of falling ill.

The news comes as British health officials were trying to track down around 2,000 who have flown to the country from China in the last two weeks.

Wuhan is just one area of China affected by the lockdown, which now restricts the movement of 56 million people.

Ms Theobald’s grandson Kharn, a PE teacher in Wuhan who has lived in the city for five years, told the PA news agency: “There is no knowing how long she will have to stay here, and I’m worried about her running out of the medication she needs for her health so I’m in constant contact with the British embassy.

“I do worry if I have to go out for whatever reason that I will bring something back into the house and she will become infected and fall ill.

“She only brought enough medication for her time here plus an extra week in case of any flight delays etc. But nothing can prepare you for this.

“My family at home are extremely concerned about her, but I’m trying hard to reassure them that I am taking the best care of her as I can.”

Mr Lambert said the embassy had put them in touch with a doctor who is due to check up on his grandmother’s health after the weekend.

He said the mood in Wuhan had changed in the last 24 hours.

“People are starting to realise the seriousness off the situation,” he added.

“Due to the hysteria caused by the lockdown yesterday, it was difficult to get food and any food that was available had been increased in price. However, I went to the supermarket today and the shelves had been restocked.”

Fellow Briton Mustafa Siddiqui, 36, a Londoner who has lived in Wuhan for 14 years, said: “This is the first time in a decade I’ve seen the city this quiet. It’s very eerie outside, people are taking precautions, they are wearing masks, they are wearing surgical gloves.

“In my opinion the message did go out a little slow, but you have to put this in a context that this is Chinese New Year time and the authorities do not want to create panic.”

Two British teachers working in the city have also told how they are unable to return to Wuhan while it remains on lockdown.
