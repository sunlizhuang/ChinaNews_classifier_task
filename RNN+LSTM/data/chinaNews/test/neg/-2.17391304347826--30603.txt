Coronavirus reaches Arizona

The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) and the Maricopa County Department of Public Health (MCDPH) have confirmed that a Maricopa County resident has been diagnosed with the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. As with other confirmed cases in the United States, the patient recently returned from traveling in Wuhan, China.

According to information released by public health officials, the patient is affiliated in some way with the Arizona State University, but does not live in university housing. They are reportedly in satisfactory condition and have been placed in isolation to avoid any further contact.

MCDPH and ADHS are working to identify any people who have come into close contact with the patient while they were infectious. The agencies said that any individuals who have been identified as having been exposed will be contacted directly and monitored for symptoms.

Similar to statements made by public officials in other areas, such as Washington State, ADHS has proclaimed the risk level to be low but encourages vigilance.

While the immediate risk of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus to the general public is believed to be low at this time, ADHS and our county public health partners will continue to actively monitor for the disease,” said Dr. Cara Christ, ADHS director. “There are simple daily precautions that everyone should always take to prevent the spread of diseases.”

Symptoms typically appear two to 14 days after exposure and are similar to that of the flu such as fever, cough, runny nose, and difficulty breathing. Individuals who have traveled to Wuhan or have been exposed to people who have are considered the most at risk.

No vaccine or commercial test has been developed yet.

ADHS recommends that people experiencing symptoms remain in their home and call a healthcare provider immediately.
