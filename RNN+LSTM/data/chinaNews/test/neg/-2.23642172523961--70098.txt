Allen said Ontario's testing process for the bug, now named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization, has now been accelerated.

Public health lab technicians in Ontario have begun using the same method as the federal lab in Winnipeg where previous cases have been sent for confirmation.

Negative tests in Ontario are no longer being shipped to Winnipeg, meaning cases can be ruled out within 24 hours of the swabs being taken instead of waiting another two or three days for a second test in Manitoba.

However, samples that test positive in Ontario are still being sent to Winnipeg for confirmation.

As of Thursday morning, Ontario had 15 cases under investigation and awaiting results. There have been no new confirmed cases in the last two weeks, despite the rising number of deaths and illnesses in China and to a lesser extent in other countries.

There are no more than 60,000 cases of the new coronavirus around the world, mostly in China.

Elsewhere in Canada, British Columbia has four cases.

Three people from Canada's first repatriation flight from China have been tested for the novel coronavirus after showing symptoms of cough or fever at CFB Trenton but those tests have come back negative, Williams said.

Health Minister Christine Elliott said she is pleased that Ontario has not been hit harder by the coronavirus, although Williams noted authorities are staying vigilant.

"We are confident it is being contained," Elliott said on the way into a cabinet meeting on Thursday.

"The system is working. People are doing their part and our medical professionals are doing what they need to do as well."
