RALEIGH - A possible case of the 2019 coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China has been identified in North Carolina, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

The individual, who arrived at Raleigh-Durham International Airport on Jan. 23, had passed through Wuhan but "had not visited the seafood and animal market that was linked to many early cases," according to a DHHS release on Jan. 24.

"The patient presented with mild respiratory symptoms and is currently in good condition and being cared for in isolation at Duke University Hospital," the DHHS stated. Testing for the coronavirus is being coordinated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

'Abundance of caution'

"Although it is unlikely that this person was infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus, we are conducting testing out of an abundance of caution," said Dr. Zack Moore, State Epidemiologist. "If you haven’t traveled to Wuhan in the past two weeks, your risk of infection with this virus is very low."

While at RDU, the person wore a mask and did not have close contact with anyone after disembarking, according to the DHHS release. The individual was taken directly to the hospital using all appropriate infection prevention measures.

Anyone at RDU or the hospital at the same time as this individual is not considered at risk for infection, the DHHS said.

"If infection with the 2019 coronavirus is confirmed, DPH will work closely with the CDC and local partners to reach out to people who came in close contact with the person on the airline flights," the release said.

2 cases confirmed in U.S.

Earlier on Jan. 24, the Chicago Department of Public Health confirmed a second U.S. case of coronavirus, one day after the U.S. State Department issued its most severe travel advisory – Level 4: do not travel – for the central Chinese province of Hubei, home to Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.

Although the country as a whole maintains its Level 2 advisory (exercise increased caution), the State Department issued a special warning for the Wuhan region and noted that it had evacuated all non-essential personnel from China, limiting its ability to aid U.S. citizens in Hubei province.

"There is an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia first identified in Wuhan, China, caused by a novel (new) coronavirus. In an effort to contain the novel coronavirus, the Chinese authorities have suspended air and rail travel in the area around Wuhan," the advisory reads.
