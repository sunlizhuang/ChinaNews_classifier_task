A pig did fly - well, it bungee jumped - and people aren't happy about it. A Chinese theme park is facing backlash after strapping snowball up and pushing him off a tower at Meixin Red Wine Town Theme park in Chongqing. Witnesses say the pig was squealing as park employees drug the animal, donned with a cape, toward the edge of the tower and pushed it off. The park has apologized for the stunt, which was part of opening ceremonies for the new attraction, while at the same time wishing people happy Lunar New Year - the Year of the Pig. The New York Times reports animal rights activism is a new and growing phenomenon in the people's republic.
