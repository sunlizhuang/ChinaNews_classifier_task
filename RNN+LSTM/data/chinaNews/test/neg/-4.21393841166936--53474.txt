The Chinese government is strengthening disinfection measures to contain the spread of the deadly coronavirus outbreak.

Chinese airlines have started suspending services to New Zealand as new border restrictions put in place to combat a coronavirus outbreak takes its toll on passenger numbers.

Novel coronavirus, believed to have originated from a live animal market in Wuhan, China, has infected nearly 15,000 people in China, and killed more than 300 people.

Over the weekend the Government said any foreign travellers who left or had transit through mainland China after Sunday would be refused entry to New Zealand. New Zealand citizens and permanent residents returning to New Zealand were exempt but would be required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arriving back in the country.

DEAN KOZANIC/STUFF China Southern has suspended its Christchurch service and is reducing its Auckland service from 14 flights per week to four.

The border restrictions would be in place for 14 days, and would be reviewed every 48 hours.

Almost 10,000 Chinese visitors had so far cancelled trips to New Zealand, Tourism New Zealand said on Friday, but industry sources said that was likely to be the tip of the iceberg.

Before Friday six airlines flew direct between New Zealand and five airports in mainland China, with around 45 flights per week into Auckland and seven per week into Christchurch.

On Saturday Air New Zealand suspended its daily direct Auckland-Shanghai service until March 29 due to a decline in customer bookings along with operational and crew logistical challenges posed by the border restrictions.

The remaining airlines to fly between New Zealand and mainland China are Chinese carriers with Air China flying Auckland-Beijing daily, China Southern flying Auckland-Guangzhou 14 times a week and Christchurch-Guangzhou daily, Sichuan Airlines flying Auckland-Chengdu three times a week, China Eastern flying Auckland-Shanghai nine times a week and Hainan Airlines flying Auckland-Chongqing three times a week.

RICKY WILSON/STUFF China Eastern is still operating direct flights between Shanghai and Auckland.

But China Southern said it had suspended one of its daily Auckland services until further notice and would suspend its Christchurch service from February 11 to March 28.

Its remaining Auckland service would be reduced to four flights per week from February 11 to March 28.

China Eastern Airlines is suspending its daily Shanghai-Auckland service from February 11 to March 28 and cancelling the last of its additional peak season service from February 11 to February 15.

Both airlines are offering refunds and rebooking options for customers affected by the flight cancellations.

Hainan Airlines cancelled its Auckland-Chongqing flight on Tuesday and has no future flights between Chongqing and Auckland available on its website.

Air China and Sichuan Airlines had flights arriving at Auckland Airport on Tuesday.

SUPPLIED Sichuan Airlines has a flight arriving at Auckland Airport on Tuesday evening.

Air China, Sichuan Airlines and Hainan Airlines did not respond to requests for comment.

Board of Airline Representatives New Zealand executive director Justin Tighe-Umbers said passenger movements between China and New Zealand had been "severely curtailed" by New Zealand's border closure.

Up to 10,000 passengers a week were visiting New Zealand before coronavirus started to impact numbers, he said.

Chinese airlines were expected to start cancelling or consolidating services, he said.

"There are flights still coming from China as the airlines honour commitments to those passengers who are New Zealand citizens and residents," Tighe-Umbers said.

"These airlines are also focused on getting Chinese citizen ticket-holders in New Zealand back home to China."

House of Travel commercial director Brent Thomas said Chinese airlines would need to decide whether they looked for different routes to put idle aircraft on or leave them sitting on the ground waiting for the ban to be lifted.

"They will be looking at better utilisation of aircraft."

He said it would be New Zealand's loss if Chinese carriers redeployed aircraft on routes which provided better yields, and decided not to return to New Zealand."We would hope they don't leave New Zealand for other routes."
