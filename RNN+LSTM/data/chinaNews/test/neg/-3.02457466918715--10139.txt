(Jan 16): In all, China could make almost $95 billion in additional purchases of American commodities as part of its trade deal with the U.S. The prospect is already drawing skepticism.

Prices of most raw materials that are part of the pledge fell Wednesday, with traders saying actual evidence of increases in shipments is needed for gains. The pessimism was in contrast to comments at the White House by U.S. President Donald Trump, who contended that American energy producers and farmers would benefit.

As Trump faces re-election later this year, he’s under pressure to appeal to voters in the American farm belt, where the economy has been roiled by the long-running trade war. But while China promised to buy everything from oilseeds to cereal, as well as crude and liquefied natural gas, it didn’t say how much it would import of each product.

“Signing the deal is the easy part,” Ken Morrison, a St. Louis-based independent commodity trader, said by phone. “I have yet to hear a sound argument on how China will execute this deal.”

China pledged to buy a total of $32 billion in additional agricultural products over the next two years, while it will also “strive” for another $10 billion. That includes oilseeds, meat, cereals, ethanol and cotton. It also promised $52.4 billion in further purchases of American energy such as LNG, crude oil and coal over 2020 and 2021.

However, the so-called phase-one deal that was signed in Washington Wednesday didn’t specify whether the Asian nation will lift retaliatory duties it imposed on American goods such as soybeans and LNG.

“There’s not enough clarity as to how they are going to do it,” said Fernando Valle, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s just big numbers thrown around.”

If China does increase purchases, that would give a boost to the U.S. LNG industry, which is facing a global market awash with excess supply. The Asian nation, the world’s fastest-growing buyer of the heating and power-plant fuel, hasn’t imported any American cargoes for months.

U.S. oil exports to China have also slumped because of the trade war. The world’s biggest crude buyer skipped American purchases for six months through November, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Coal will likely be a small component of the accord.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude slid 0.7% Wednesday, while natural gas fell 3.1%. The Bloomberg Commodity Index, which measures returns from raw materials, declined 0.4%.

The potential additional agricultural purchases of over $40 billion over 2020-2021 compares with $24 billion in agricultural and related products that China imported from the U.S. in 2017, before the trade war began.

But the outlook for farm trade is uncertain, given some tariffs are still in place. Soybeans futures in Chicago fell 1.4%, cotton declined 1.5% and hog futures were little changed.

“Without more concrete details, we are deeply concerned that all of this pain may not have been worth it,” the National Farmers Union, which represents almost 200,000 American farmers, said in a statement. “Given the numerous deals that have been reached and then breached in the past two years, we are also skeptical.”
