Britain will put people airlifted from China into quarantine amid concerns that around 1,500 people who arrived in the UK since the new year have not undergone checks.

Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, ordered a “belt and braces” approach to the coronavirus amid concerns that the virus is far more contagious than was thought.

Scientists in China believe that it could be transmitted for up to two weeks before the carrier has any symptoms, such as a fever or cough.

Under the new plans, all 1,500 people who have flown in from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, since mid-January will be asked to remain in isolation for at least a fortnight.

Health officials are now desperately attempting to track such cases, to make sure they stay in their homes, and limit any spread of the disease.

But it is understood that they only have contact details for one in 10 cases who arrived on such flights.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has embarked on a desperate scramble to return another 200 British nationals stranded in Wuhan.
