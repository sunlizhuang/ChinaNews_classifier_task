Activity in much of the rest of China has been severely disrupted. Exacerbating the pandemonium is that most Chinese were away visiting family for the Lunar New Year holiday when the virus took hold and have been unable to get back home. Schools are also closed, and it will be difficult for workers to get back on the job until the schools reopen. Chinese officials will also most certainly prefer to err on the side of caution when re-opening schools and other facilities rather than risk reigniting the outbreak.
