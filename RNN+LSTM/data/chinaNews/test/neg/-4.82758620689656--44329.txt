Chinese pupils at a top British boarding school have been barred from flying home for the holidays for fear of them contracting the deadly coronavirus.

Hereford Cathedral School said all planned trips to visit loved ones have been scrapped and the boarding house will stay open during half term next week.

The Â£15,000-a-year institution is ratcheting up efforts to insulate its students and staff from the infection after the first two cases were confirmed on UK soil.

These patients, one of whom is a York University student, have sparked panic as Britons rush to buy protective face masks.

But the problem at home pales in comparison to China, where the outbreak spawned in Wuhan and has now spread to infect almost 12,000 and kill 259.

Other private schools with overseas students are also banning them returning to China.

A senior source at a high-flying British boarding school told MailOnline: 'I doubt many if any schools will be sending pupils back at half term. All of ours are not returning, including some from Thailand.'

This week teachers were warned to keep an eye out for xenophobia in the classroom as students could exclude their Chinese peers over misplaced fears they could catch coronavirus.

Hyper-aware that the bug is both extremely contagious and lethal, Hereford Cathedral School moved swiftly to impose a blanket ban on its crop of Chinese pupils returning home, despite their 'concern' for friends and family.

'None of the pupils are travelling back home and the boarding house will remain open over half term,' the school's marketing manager Laura Yates told the Hereford Times.

'None of the students from China have been there since the outbreak and any planned visits from family and friends have been cancelled. We're doing everything we can do.

'Our medical and boarding staff have been briefed.'

Many Chinese parents send their children to Britain's elite boarding schools, creating tough decisions for headteachers forced to weigh up whether they should be allowed to go home for the short winter break.

Sources told MailOnline that parties of prospective students and parents who planned to tour schools ahead of next year's intake have been axed while the world wrestles to squash the spread of the virus.

Wellington School in Somerset has advised parents of Chinese pupils to forbid their children from flying back for the break.

Headmaster Eugene du Toit told the County Gazette: 'I have also told parents of students in year 11 and in the upper sixth that they should anticipate not allowing their children to travel home during the Easter break so that their ability to complete external examinations is not compromised.

'It is of paramount importance that we do everything within our power to minimise the threat of coronavirus to our children and the community and keep everyone safe.'

Bullying could also creep into the classroom as students shun their Chinese peers over misplaced fears of contracting illness.

This week the Boarding Schools' Association even warned teachers to 'stay alert for signs of xenophobia' both during the day and on social media.

Updated advice to accommodate coronavirus concerns read: 'Stay alert for any signs of xenophobia by students towards one another, or by any external audiences, either in school or on social media sites.

'Such behaviour should not be tolerated and action should be taken against anyone acting in this way.

'They [Chinese pupils] will be worried about themselves but more particularly about their friends and families.'
