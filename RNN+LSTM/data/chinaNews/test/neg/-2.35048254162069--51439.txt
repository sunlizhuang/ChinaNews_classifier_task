Detroit Metro Airport is among 11 in the U.S. where travelers who've been to China in the last 14 days are being diverted for enhanced health screenings and quarantines as the novel coronavirus continues to spread around the world and the death toll climbs.

Passengers were to be diverted to Metro Airport beginning Monday morning to prevent the spread of the pneumonia-like virus, which has sickened more than 17,300 people around the world and killed at least 360.

It's first time the federal government has mandated a quarantine in more than 50 years — since smallpox in the 1960s.

"We are preparing as if this were the next pandemic," said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Respiratory Diseases.

"Strong measures now may blunt the impact of this virus on the United States."

Although the diversion of travelers from mainland China to Detroit Metro (DTW) was supposed to begin Monday morning, a spokesman for the Wayne County Health Division said none were rerouted on the first day.

"We haven't made an estimation on a local level, but from the national level, they're saying 20 per day" could be diverted to the 11 designated airports, said Michael McElrath, a spokesman for the Wayne County Health Division. "That's on the national level. If you look at our portion, it could be two."

The people coming to DTW on diverted flights from China are to undergo enhanced health screenings for coronavirus, and will be issued a level of risk based on those evaluations, he said.

Those who are coming from the region of China that's been hardest hit in the coronavirus outbreak — the Hubei province — will be screened for fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and will be subjected to mandatory quarantines.

"If symptomatic, American citizens and those who are exempt will be transferred for further medical evaluation," Messonnier said. "They will not be able to complete their itinerary and will be isolated for 14 days."

Those who do not have symptoms will be "subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine at or near that location," she said. "Remember, this is specifically for people who are returning from Hubei province. These people will not be able to complete their itinerary."

Those who came to the United States from other parts of China also will undergo medical screening, and if they're asymptomatic, Messonnier said, they'll be "allowed to reach their final destination, and after arrival will be asked to stay home as much as possible and monitor their health for 14 days."

Those with symptoms, she said, will be transferred for additional medical evaluations and possible quarantine.

McElrath would not disclose which Michigan hospitals or medical centers would treat potential coronavirus patients. Nor would he say where quarantined travelers who are not ill enough for hospitalization could be housed locally.

"We know where, but we're not going to share the location where people are quarantining," McElrath said. "We're just not going to do that. ... It's not a good practice for public health privacy and safety purposes.

"The Customs and Border Patrol and CDC screen in the airport and based off of their assessment of risk, they determine the level of quarantine, from full quarantine at a medical facility and restricted travel to social distancing and limited travel."

Public health epidemiologists would then coordinate the monitoring of those people within the 14-day period after they arrive in the U.S., he said.

Cleaning crews are stepping up efforts to clean — and hopefully wipe out germs — in the international arrivals areas in both the McNamara and North terminals at Metro Airport, said Wayne County Airport Authority CEO Chad Newton.

“Our team at Detroit Metropolitan Airport is committed to assisting our federal partners in their efforts to protect the public from exposure to the coronavirus,” Newton said.

“Although airport staff does not conduct passenger screening, our emergency responders are prepared to support the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health departments with medical transportation and police escorts, when needed."

Also on Monday, the state Department of Health and Human Services activated the Community Health Emergency Coordination Center in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

The center will develop and distribute guidelines and educational materials about this new strain of coronavirus and coordinate with local health departments.

Four people in Michigan with recent travel to China were suspected of having coronavirus in January, and underwent testing through the CDC. All four tests were negative.

No other people have been tested or are suspected of having coronavirus in Michigan now, Lynn Sutfin, a spokeswoman for the MDHHS.

The first U.S. case of coronavirus was identified on Jan. 21. Since then, 10 other people have been confirmed to have the illness in Washington state, California, Arizona, Illinois and Massachusetts. Of them, two did not travel to China and contracted it through close contact with a person sickened by the virus.

Test results are pending for 82 suspected cases, according to the CDC.

The tighter travel restrictions were ordered Sunday by Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Chad F. Wolf.

“While the overall risk to the American public remains low, funneling all flights with passengers who have recently been in China is the most important and prudent step we can take at this time to decrease the strain on public health officials screening incoming travelers," Wolf said DHS in a news release. "These steps will also expedite the processing of U.S. citizens returning from China, and ensure resources are focused on the health and safety of the American people.

“We realize this could provide added stress and prolong travel times for some individuals, however, public health and security experts agree these measures are necessary to contain the virus and protect the American people.”

The other 10 airports that are accepting diverted passengers are: John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), New York; Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD); San Francisco International Airport (SFO); Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA); Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL), Hawaii; Los Angeles International Airport (LAX); Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL); Washington-Dulles International Airport (IAD); Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW).

Travelers arrive to LAX Tom Bradley International Terminal wearing medical masks for protection against the coronavirus outbreak in Los Angeles. The United States has declared a public health emergency and will implement strict travel restrictions later today. Foreign nationals who have been in China in the last two weeks and are not immediate family members of U.S. citizens or permanent residents will be barred from entering the U.S. Meanwhile, about 195 U.S. citizens who were evacuated from China to March Air Reserve in California are under under quarantine at the base, prohibited from leaving until it is determined that they will not develop symptoms of the disease.

As part of the tightened travel restrictions, foreign nationals (other than immediate family of U.S. citizens, permanent residents and flight crew) who have traveled to China in the last two weeks will not be allowed to enter the United States.
