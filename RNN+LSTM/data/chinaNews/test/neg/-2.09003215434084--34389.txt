An Aston University student was tested for coronavirus after displaying "flu-like" symptoms following their arrival from China.

The university confirmed the incident after a medic in a hazmat suit was filmed outside halls of residence off James Watt Queensway, in Birmingham city centre, on Saturday night, January 25.

The student was tested for the illness and was given the all-clear and discharged.

Almost 100 people across the country had been checked for coronavirus, as of 2pm on Tuesday, January 28. No positive tests have been recorded.

Aston University said it was continuing to monitor the situation closely and would follow guidance from Public Heath England.

It said in a statement: “A student from the one of the halls of residence on campus was taken to hospital by ambulance on Saturday night.

“We understand the NHS is approaching all cases reporting flu-like symptoms with extreme caution in order to keep their ambulance crews and other employees safe.

“As the student had recently arrived in the UK from China they were tested for coronavirus as a precautionary measure. The test was negative and the student has now been discharged from hospital.

“Aston University takes the health and safety of its staff and students very seriously. We are monitoring the coronavirus situation closely and we are following guidance from Public Health England, the World Health Organisation and other relevant agencies.”

The news emerged 24 hours after BirminghamLive told how Harborne man, Drew Bennett, was put into isolation at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

It happened after he visited his GP after returning from Wuhan - at the centre of the epidemic in China - on New Year's Eve.

Back in Birmingham and feeling unwell, he took to his bed - believing it to be a serious case of the flu. His symptoms eventually subsided and he visited the doctor on Monday, January 27, for an unrelated matter.

There his GP asked if he had visited China and when it emerged he had and subsequently been ill, he was told to return home.

An ambulance was sent to his address.

Speaking exclusively to BirminghamLive from his hospital bed, Drew said he was awaiting blood test results.

"I had been in Wuhan on holiday over Christmas and came back to Harborne on December 31.

"Once I got back I was really ill with, what I thought, was a bad case of the flu. At that stage coronavirus hadn't really been mentioned so I thought nothing of it.

"However, when I went to the GP on Monday and he asked as a precaution if I had been to China, he seemed really concerned.

"I was sent home and before I knew it, ambulances and people in hazmat suits had turned up. I'm now in isolation at the QE and just waiting to get my blood test results.

"I don't feel particularly unwell now, but I've not been 100 per cent since returning from Wuhan. Since I got over the worst symptoms I've been back to work, shopping, just normal life. It's a really worrying time and not a nice experience."

The government said it was monitoring the situation closely and would continue to work with the World Health Organization (WHO) and international community.

If and when a first case in the UK is confirmed, it will be announced as soon as possible by the Chief Medical Officer of the affected country, followed by a statement by England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty.
