Scientists now believe that the deadly virus spreading around the globe from China was passed to humans from snakes sold at the open-air market in Wuhan.

Researchers at Peking University believe that 2019-nCoV, the SARS-like coronavirus that's infected more than 500 people worldwide and killed 17, is made up of a combination of one that affects bats and another, totally unknown coronavirus.

They think genetic material from the two recombined, picked up a protein that lets viruses bind to certain host cells - including those of humans.

When they analysed the genes of strains affecting various host animals, the team found that snakes were susceptible to the most similar version of the coronavirus, and likely provided a 'reservoir' for the viral strain to grow stronger and replicate.

Sold alongside a menagerie the included live koalas, rats and wolf pups at the Huanan Seafood Market in central Wuhan - now thought to be the outbreak's epicentre - snakes likely then served as the jumping-off point for the virus to begin infecting humans.

'Results derived from our evolutionary analysis suggest for the first time that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019-nCoV,' the authors wrote in the Journal of Medical Virology.

'New information obtained from our evolutionary analysis is highly significant for effective control of the outbreak caused by the 2019-nCoV-induced pneumonia.'

Most types of virus have many different strains, but no all of them occur in all places, and not every strain can infect every species.

For their new study, the Peking University team sequenced the genomes of 272 strains of coronavirus.

The new strain that's emerged from China is only the seventh version of a coronavirus known to infect humans.

Four are common causes of colds and generally don't lead to severe illnesses.

Deadlier coronaviruses include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), first seen in China in 2003 and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) which emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2013.

And now, the new mysterious Chinese coronavirus known - for now - as 2019-nCoV, which cropped up at the Huanan Seafood Market in December.

Live animal and game markets are not uncommon sources of new viral illnesses that afflict humans (although this in itself is an uncommon occurrence).

Where animals mix and mingle, so do the viruses the carry. And when viruses mix and mingle, they can exchange genetic material, mutating and become novel strains.

This seems to be the case with the current coronavirus outbreak.

According to the new study, the new coronavirus's genetic material - RNA, unlike some viruses that are composed of DNA - looks to be a cross-breed of a strain known to infect bats and one for which they couldn't pinpoint a known match.

What species a virus is able to infect depends on what proteins it has on the surfaces of its cells, and whether they can bind to the receptors on the surfaces of other animals' cells.

So somewhere along its evolutionary path, 2019-nCoV picked up a protein or protein keys that turned the lock to give it access to snakes.

From there proliferated and mutated in such a way that may have given it access to humans shopping the Huanan Seafood Market.

The market has since been closed and has been labelled 'ground zero' by local authorities.

The highly-contagious virus has killed 17 people and infected hundreds in China, South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and the US.

A list of prices for one of the businesses operating at the market showed a menagerie of animals available for sale including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, koalas and game meats.

The study authors believe their work likely narrows down the source of the virus from the list of 112 live animals and animal products that were sold at the market that's likely the outbreak's epicenter.

'Freshly slaughtered, frozen and delivered to your door,' said the price list for the vendor called Wild Game Animal Husbandry for the Masses.

Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said in Beijing on Wednesday that authorities believe the virus likely came from 'wild animals at the seafood market' though the exact source remains undetermined.

10 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT CHINA'S CORONAVIRUS 1. At least 17 people have been killed, all in the Chinese province of Hubei 2. At least 500 people in China's 18 provinces, autonomous regions, special administrative regions and municipalities have been infected 3. The vast majority of patients are related to Wuhan, the provincial capital of Hubei with a population of around 11 million 4. Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and the United States have all reported confirmed cases 5. The virus can be passed between humans 6. It has certain ability to spread within a neighbourhood 7. The virus has mainly been passed through the human respiratory system 8. The source of the virus has been identified as the illegally sold wildlife meat 9. The virus can evolve 10. It is more difficult for children to contract the virus, the reason remains unknown Source: China's National Health Commission, People's Daily

China bans the trafficking of a number of wild species or requires special licences, but regulations are loose for some species if they are commercially farmed.

The Beijing News published a photo on Tuesday showing the same vendor's now-shuttered store front, as authorities in white hazmat suits milled about.

The paper also quoted other merchants as saying trade in wildlife took place up until the market was shuttered for disinfection shortly after the outbreak.

A number of the early sufferers of the coronavirus were employees of the market.

AFP tried unsuccessfully to contact the vendor.

Experts have warned it is 'possible' the virus will hit Australia.

Chief Medical Officer ­Brendan Murphy met with Prime Minister Scott Morrison at the Department of Health's National Incident Room in Canberra.

'We do have a lot of traffic from China and I think it's quite possible we will get some cases here but I'm very ­confident that we're well ­prepared to respond if we do,' Professor Murphy said.

'We currently have over 10 million masks even though we distributed 3.5 million during the bushfires, so we've got a good stockpile.'

Mr Morrison was adamant that the country was well-equipped.

'The states and Commonwealth are working together to stay ahead of this,' Mr Morrison said.

Wild animals ready to be sold at The Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan in China

A Melbourne man was rushed to hospital for respiratory problems after a trip to China but was later cleared.

Another man in Brisbane was also suspected of contracting the disease but was cleared on Wednesday.

Australia will begin screening passengers that land from Wuhan where a new deadly virus was discovered last month.

The new screening efforts will only be in place at Sydney Airport where three direct flights from Wuhan land per week on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays.

When China Eastern Airlines flight MU749 lands on Thursday, passengers will be met by biosecurity staff from New South Wales Health and Border Force officials.

Passengers are expected to be screened for high temperatures with thermal imaging - but the method is not 100 per cent successful because people can harbour the coronavirus with no symptoms for days.

Anyone who does have a high temperature or is feeling unwell will be interviewed by officials.

It comes as US health authorities on Tuesday announced the first case of a person on American soil being diagnosed with the virus as millions of travellers prepare to take flights for Lunar New Year on Saturday.

Bats are thought to have spawned SARS, which in 2002-03 killed hundreds of people in Asia, mostly China.

SARS was also found in civets in wildlife markets in China, with many scientists believing the bat virus infected the cat-like creatures and then humans who ate them.

Following SARS, China cracked down on consumption of civets and some other species, but conservationists say the trade continues.

China has so far won praise for its openness and handling of the current outbreak in stark contrast to SARS, when it was accused of stifling information and failing to cooperate with the rest of the world.
