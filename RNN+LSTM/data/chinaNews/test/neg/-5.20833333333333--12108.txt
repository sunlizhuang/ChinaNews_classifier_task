Qingdao Customs in east China's Shandong Province said Thursday that it had seized 58 cactus seedlings in several inbound parcels sent from Germany and Italy.

The cactus seedlings were identified as species covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.

Qingdao Customs discovered seven suspicious postal parcels during an inspection and later found the 58 cactus seedlings wrapped in paper. All the postal parcels were delivered to one person in the city of Weifang.

Investigation into the case is underway.
