In times of crisis, you would hope your family would be there to help you out.

That wasn’t the case for two young kids who were allegedly abandoned at the departure gate of an airport in Nanjing, China by their parents, according to Chinese media as reported by the Daily Mail.

One of the children, a boy, was reportedly not permitted to fly because he had a fever of 38.5 C. A Chinese blogger posted photos of the departure gate, showing the children sitting alone.

“The airline company did not allow (the boy) to board the plane but the children’s parents would not agree,” a passenger on the flight told Yangzi Evening News.

The parents supposedly put up a fight, arguing with the airline employee’s after boarding, imploring them to let the children on the flight.

After a nearly two-hour-long back-and-forth that delayed the domestic flight, the airport officials relented, allowing both children to board the plane.

“At last, workers let the adults onto the plane,” the flight passenger claimed, adding that during the disagreement “the children were simply left to sit in the airport by themselves.”

Meanwhile, fear around the spread of the coronavirus that originated in China has steadily grown as 26 people have died so far with hundreds more contracting the virus.

In a bid to contain the virus, Chinese officials have shut down transportation into 10 cities and have even closed the Forbidden City and parts of the Great Wall.

Estimates state the coronavirus in China could infect up to 350,000 in Wuhan, China, alone, according to the Daily Mail.
