At the epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic, an elderly man lies dead on the pavement after collapsing in a street in Wuhan. The central Chinese city is home to 11 million people, but on January 23 the Chinese government put the entire city under lockdown, suspending all buses, trains, flights and ferries.

In the following week the lockdown was extended to multiple cities in Hubei province ‚Äì the central Chinese province that has bore the brunt of the outbreak so far. There are now 45 million people living under quarantine throughout Hubei province.

But with the lockdown entering its second week and the outbreak showing no signs of slowing down, tens of millions of Chinese citizens are having to adjust to life under quarantine. These photos gives a glimpse inside Wuhan, the isolated city at the heart of the global epidemic.

A security guard stands outside Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market ‚Äì the market thought to be the origin of some of the first coronavirus infections. The seafood market is a wet market, where fish, poultry and other animals are slaughtered on the premise and live animals are sold, including cats, dogs, turtles, snakes, rats and marmots. One theory about the disease‚Äôs origin is that it began in a live animal at the market before jumping into humans.

The market was shut down on January 1 for inspection and decontamination, shortly after the first cases of the virus were reported to the World Health Organisation. But it might not be the only source of the virus. The earliest known person infected with coronavirus, a patient who fell ill on December 1, 2019, had no link to the seafood market at all. Of the early cases, 13 of them had no link to the market either, suggesting that there may be an early or alternative origin of the infection.

Medical staff wearing protective clothing help treat patients arriving at Wuhan Red Cross Hospital on January 25. Of the 9,800 confirmed cases in China, most of them are within Hubei province and all of the deaths so far from the virus have happened within China.

It is likely that the real number of infected people is much higher than official numbers suggest, as many people with mild symptoms might not report to medical authorities and others may be unaware they are ill at all. Epidemiologists modelling the spread of the disease estimate that by next week there may be as many as 200,000 cases. Another estimate from Northeastern university in the United States suggests that the number of infected in Wuhan city may be as high as 25,000.
