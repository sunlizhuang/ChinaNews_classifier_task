As the threat of the coronavirus increases, a major US orchestra has cancelled their upcoming eight-concert tour to East Asia.

A major American symphony orchestra’s tour to East Asia has been cancelled given the increasing threat posed by the coronavirus, which has already killed 132 people in China and infected nearly 6,000.

The Boston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Andris Nelsons, had planned an eight-concert tour from 6 to 16 February, taking them to Hong Kong, Shangai, Taipei and Seoul.

“On behalf of Andris Nelsons and the musicians of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, we are all deeply disappointed that we will not be able to perform for the wonderful audiences in Seoul, Taipei, Hong Kong, and Shanghai,” Boston Symphony President and CEO Mark Volpe said in a statement.

“With the health and well-being of the musicians always of foremost concern, we have cancelled the entire tour.”
