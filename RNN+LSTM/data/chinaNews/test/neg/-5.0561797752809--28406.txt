Last week a video of a woman eating a bat went viral and many were absolutely shocked at the scene. It was gross and the bat was even eaten whole complete with its skin and wings. But it seems that people in China have bizarre eating habits as another disgusting video of a man eating several live baby mice have surfaced online.

The revolting video is making rounds on social media and many of those who watched it were infuriated as they can’t help but connect these revolting eating practice to the Wuhan virus that already killed more than a dozen people and the region ending up being locked down to avoid the spread of the deadly virus that is easily spread from one human to another human.

Amid the fears for the Wuhan virus, people were criticizing the Chinese people for their odd eating habit especially when it was suggested that the new virus strain could have originated from bats. The center of the coronavirus is a market in Wuhan where all sorts of animals are being sold for exotic delicacies.

In any case, the video of the man eating live mice was uploaded on Jan. 23 and this has been retweeted more than 3,000 times. In the disgusting footage, a man could be seen taking a sip of an alcoholic beverage and then picking up one mouse on a plate that was decorated with tomatoes. He dipped it in a sauce and it went straight to his month.

The rat was wriggling at the tip of the chopsticks and the man ate it fully alive. The seemed to find it tasty as he nods while chewing as if to say it was really delicious.





It was said that this is a delicacy in China that is being served in backstreet restaurants and this dish is called Three Squeaks. The reason for the name is because the rat squeaks when it is picked up and then it squeaks again when dipped in the sauce and finally when it enters the diner’s mouth and eventually dies.

The offensive dish is popular in Guangdong province but where the footage was taken was unknown. According to China Underground, this dish is actually banned in China and it was forbidden by some religious people.

These believers forbid eating any parts taken from animals that are still alive. However, apparently, most Chinese people ignored this as they are known to eat almost any animals, even the unthinkable ones, and they can eat them alive too.

“I can’t believe these pictures. In this civilized society, we eat newborn mice,” one commenter wrote. “Scares me. Intolerable.”

Another one said that the world is paying for the price for the Chinese inhumane eating practice. “It once resulted in SARS in 2003 & NOW causing #WuhanCoronavirus,” one Twitter user commented. “It's Irresponsible Can #China give some contributions to the World??”
