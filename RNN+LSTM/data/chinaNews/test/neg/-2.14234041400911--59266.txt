He added that the patient spent most of the time in her accommodation and developed a fever on Jan 26.

“She did not seek treatment from any health facility and just took fever medicine bought by her son from a pharmacy nearby,” he added.

The woman was due to return to China on Feb 4 via a flight from Johor Bahru to Guangzhou, but she did not travel as she was not feeling well. Her son and daughter-in-law left as scheduled.
