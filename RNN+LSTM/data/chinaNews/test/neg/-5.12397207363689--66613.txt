Armed police surrounded a Nunsthorpe home when a woman threatened to shoot police officers.

Jessica Fitzgerald, described as a 'great mum' in court, pointed an air rifle at police when they called to check on a missing teenager who was in the home.

At Grimsby Crown Court Fitzgerald, 27, of Crosby Road admitted possession of the rifle and threatening police.

She also admitted causing grievous bodily harm to a fellow inmate at New Hall prison, Wakefield by smashing a coffee table on her head in a communal area.

Judge John Thackray QC jailed Fitzgerald for a total of five years, including four years for the attack inside the prison.

He said: "Emergency workers deserve and will receive the protection of the courts."

Prosecuting, Jeremy Evans said police officers were conducting a search for a missing Grimsby child who they believed was at the Crosby Road address.

She refused to allow the offers entry and barricaded herself in. When the officers entered through a rear door she threatened them with a rifle.

Humberside Police armed response teams surrounded the home and began a three-hour stand off on February 24 last year.

Mr Evans said PCs Laura Delaney, Antony Maggs and Joshua Reid feared for their safety when she pointed the rifle at them.

They immediately withdrew from the property and summoned help from fellow officers.

Fitzgerald repeatedly hurled abuse at officers outside during the stand-off.

She barricaded herself and a number of children in the terraced home.

Mr Evans said: "Trained officers heard the air rifle being fired and went into the house. She had positioned herself behind a door. If they had opened fire she would have been in the line of fire behind the door."

He said the officers had heard the rifle being discharged but it was not loaded and subsequently there was no ammunition in the property. the Chinese-made air rifle had been a gift from her grandfather and had been kept in the loft, the court heard.

Two knives were also recovered from the home when the three-hour stand-off ended around 7pm.

Mr Evans said: "It was a well-kept and tidy home."

After her arrest Fitzgerald told police she had no recollection of making threats to shoot police and had only got the rifle from the loft in order to scare the officers.

Mr Evans told the court that while Fitzgerald was on remand she was accommodated next to fellow inmate Maryan Hussain. She played music in her cell loudly and danced, to the annoyance of Fitzgerald.

When she saw her in a communal area there was an exchange of words. The woman prisoner was sat at a coffee table writing when Fitzgerald picked up the table up and launched it at her fellow inmate. It caused a 15cm cut to her head.

She was taken to Pinderfields Hospital and had 15 stitches inserted and was discharged later that day.

For Fitzgerald, Craig Lowe said: "She is a great mum and is well supported by her family."

He said none of the emergency workers were hurt in the Crosby Road incident.

The judge said the attack in the prison was "nasty and could have been far worse."

He said: "Blows like that can cause fatal head injuries."

After the hearing Detective Constable Wayne Martin, of Humberside Police said, “When our officers arrived at the address we were looking for a 16 year-old missing girl that we believed was in the house.

“After an hour of negotiation from the street Jessica Fitzgerald had previously made threats to officers and the sound of a firearm discharge was heard and armed officers then entered the address”.

“Armed officers quickly entered the address where they were found Jessica Fitzgerald had barricaded herself into a room.

“The officers broke down the door and arrested Ms Fitzgerald who was later charged with possession of an imitation firearm and assaulting a police officer.
