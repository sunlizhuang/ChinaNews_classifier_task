PETALING JAYA: Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad says he would talk to China to support the cause of Palestinians against Israeli forces.

The Prime Minister said non-Muslim superpowers such as China, Japan and Korea must be concerned about the oppression of Palestinians by the Israelis as it is a human rights issue.

"I have spoken to the Japanese government on the issue of Palestinians but I have yet to speak to China.

"Maybe one day I will.

"Religion has got nothing to do with this. These Palestinians are deprived of their human rights and even Japan and Korea must be concerned," said Dr Mahathir.

He said this to the media after officiating the third annual conference of the league of parliamentarians for al Quds here Saturday (Feb 8).

Dr Mahathir said that US president Trump's peace plan to legalise the taking over of some parts of the Palestinian land by Israeli is a farce.

"Legalising the illegal and that is the character of the bully. Just because of your strength, you bully," he added.

He said it was an injustice that the Palestinians have been deprived of their land.

"There is no referendum and they were just pushed out from Palestine and massacred. This is gross injustice," said Dr Mahathir.
