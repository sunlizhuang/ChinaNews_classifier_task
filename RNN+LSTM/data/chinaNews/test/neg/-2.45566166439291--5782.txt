NEW DELHI: An Indian Parliament resolution adopted in 1994 states that the entire former state of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and if Parliament issued instructions, the Army will take appropriate action, the new chief of the Gen Army Manoj Narae said here on Saturday.

The head of the Army, asked about the statements of some ministers of the ANP that the “next agenda” of the government after Article 370 is to claim Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), he pointed to The Parliament’s resolution. “If Parliament wants PoK to be ours too, and we will get instructions in that regard, we will take appropriate action. If that’s the mandate, so be it,” he said.

Gen Naravane also detailed his earlier comments on the importance of the north and northeast borders, saying that India is progressively rebalancing its military forces and firepower to the east, rather than concentrating heavily on the western front. This was to ensure that he could handle separate or even collusive threats from China and Pakistan, he said.

Pakistan denounced Gen Naravane’s statement on PoK as irresponsible. “We reject the irresponsible statement of the new indian army chief regarding pre-emptive strikes through the LoC inside Azad Jammu and Kashmir (a Pakistani nomenclature for PoK) ,” the office abroad said. He said Indian leaders should not be wrong about Pakistan’s determination, recalling the response to Balakot’s “misadventure.”

Speaking on the day of January 15, Gen Naravane said that the armed forces, with an integrated ground-sea combat machinery, must “balance capabilities and deployments” to address the threats of both the northern borders with China and the western borders with Pakistan.

“To deal with our northern neighbor, we’re going to build a lot of capacity in terms of roads, infrastructure, and munitions storage. We are also moving some of our most advanced weapon systems to the east. Because of this rebalancing and recalibration, we are ready and ready to face threats from either side,” he said.

Firepower to support troops on the ground range from additional T-72 tanks in east Ladakh and Sikkim and 290 km range BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and 155mm Bofors howitzers in Arunachal Pradesh to Sukhoi-30M “air domain” “air domain” fighters KI in Bareilly, Tezpur and Chabua. In addition, 18 of Rafale’s 36 new “omni-role” fighters, which can also deliver nuclear weapons, will be based in Hasimara (West Bengal) after the first squadron climbs ambala (Haryana).

Gen Naravane, for his part, underlined the strategic importance of the Siachen Glacier-Saltoro Ridge region, which he visited from Thursday to Friday, because the glacial heights and Sakshgam Valley “are where colusivity can occur” between China and colusivity Pakistan.

Indian soldiers deployed to the Saltoro mountain range, in effect, prevent Pakistan from the west and China from the east from joining through the Karakoram Pass to threaten Ladakh. China, of course, is also rapidly expanding its presence in PoK and Gilgit-Baltistan as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project.

As for the worst-case scenario of a two-proelard war, Gen Naravane said the Army would deploy most of its forces to deal with the “primary front,” maintaining “a detaching posture” on the “secondary front.” The Army also has “double-task” formations that can move quickly from west to east, or vice versa, to address “emerging threats.”

But a two-front contingency is a teen, with India and China working to reduce border tensions after the first informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jingping in Wuhan in April 2018 led to a ” guidance” to the two military personnel to manage and defuse troop clashes during patrol in accordance with existing protocols and mechanisms. The long-standing hotline between India’s DGMO and the head of the Chinese Western Theatre Command will soon become a reality, with “all procedural aspects now being resolved,” Gen Naravane said.

The creation of the head of the Defence Staff post and the department of military affairs are “big steps” towards integration between the armed forces. “We, for our part, will make sure it succeeds. Integration will also be within the Army and the new integrated battle groups are just one example of that. But I also want to assure everyone that in this process of integration, we will take everyone. No one will be left behind,” he said.
