No new cases of novel coronavirus (nCoV) were detected in Kerala, where three tested positive in five days, the state’s health minister, KK Shailaja, said on Wednesday.



The southern state has so far put 2,528 people under observation, including 93 people quarantined in hospitals. The state’s police also launched surveillance on Wednesday.



“We have sent 223 samples to virology labs, and 193 of them tested negative. The three infected students are all stable now. Results of others are awaited, but we have no anxiety about them,” she said.



“All the 2,528 people have been told to avoid contacts with their families and keep away from social gatherings for 28 days.”



Those under observation are people who returned from China, a destination for education, business and leisure for many.



Those infected are students of medicine at Wuhan University at the epicentre of the virus that struck last month for which there is no vaccine.



Kerala on Monday declared the novel coronavirus as a state disaster and strengthened surveillance system and precautionary measures.



The minister visited the state control room here and reviewed the measures taken so far.



The police also started surveillance against possible cases following reports of two people under observation leaving for Saudi Arabia.



It also sent a Chinese man for quarantine in the Government General Hospital after he approached them saying hotels were denying him accommodation.



A police communique said it would help locate those who returned from the affected countries and subject them to the medical examination.



Police chief Loknath Behera said it was the top priority of the Janamaitri, the neighbourhood police.



He also warned of strict action against those who are spreading fake news on social media, including WhatsApp.



“Those who plant such fake news on coronavirus and forward them will be prosecuted,” a statement said quoting him.
