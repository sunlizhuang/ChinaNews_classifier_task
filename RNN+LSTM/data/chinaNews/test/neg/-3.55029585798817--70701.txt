A Japanese man who recently visited Hawaii for 11 days is one of the newly confirmed coronavirus cases.

“We do believe this is a serious concern. I just want to assure you that this scenario is exactly what we’ve been preparing for and are prepared to respond,” said Gov. David Ige at a news conference at the Hawaii Department of Health this afternoon. “Know that this raises a concern for all of us.”

The male in his 60s was on Maui from Jan. 28 to Feb. 3 and then traveled to Honolulu from Feb. 3 to 7, where he stayed at Grand Waikikian by Hilton Grand Vacations, a timeshare property.

Hawaii health officials said they are working on “identifying any potential exposure and tracking close contacts.”

The man living in Aichi Prefecture in central Japan had a 102-degree fever on Feb. 8, according to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.

The man was hospitalized, subsequently diagnosed with pneumonia and tested positive for the virus, called COVID-19. As of 3:34 p.m. today, the virus has killed over 1,500 in China and infected more than 67,000 globally, according to AP.

Japan recorded its second death from the virus, with the individual having no travel history to China where the outbreak is occurring.
