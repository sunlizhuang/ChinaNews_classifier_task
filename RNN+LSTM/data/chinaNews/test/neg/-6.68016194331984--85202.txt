LONDON – On the opening day of Julian Assange's U.S. extradition hearing here a lawyer for the U.S. government alleged that the WikiLeaks founder's publication of classified documents revealed the names of informants who later "disappeared," while the Australian national's defense team claimed the indictment against him was part of the Trump administration's determination to put a journalist's "head on a pike."

The U.S. Justice Department wants Assange extradited to the U.S. to face 17 charges pertaining to the Espionage Act 1917 and one "computer misuse" or hacking charge. The charges relate to WikiLeaks' publication a decade ago of hundreds of thousands of U.S. diplomatic cables and information, including information regarding alleged U.S. war crimes in Iraq.

The case is a test of media freedoms and the global reach of the U.S. justice system.

WikiLeaks' Assange goes to court:Here's what's at stake

James Lewis, representing the U.S. government at Woolwich Crown Court in southeast London, said that Assange was guilty of "straightforward" criminality for hacking and then publishing secret military and intelligence information that put secret U.S. sources at risk of torture or death in places from Iraq to China. He said some of these sources subsequently vanished, although he acknowledged that "the U.S. can’t prove at this point that their disappearance was the result of being outed by WikiLeaks."

He said the U.S. has identified hundreds of "at-risk and potentially at-risk people."

Edward Fitzgerald, who is representing Assange, claimed that if the 48-year-old is forcibly sent to the U.S. he would be denied a fair trial, would be at risk of suicide and, Fitzgerald added that "the prosecution is being pursued for political motives and not in good faith."

Fitzgerald said the Trump administration was pursuing the case against Assange as part of its war on the press in which the media is the "enemy of the people." President Barack Obama's administration decided it could not prosecute Assange because it was concerned it risked criminalizing subsequent national security journalism.

Monday was the first day of a week of legal arguments in a case that could have major implications for First Amendment protections for the press, partly because the U.S. government is arguing Assange should not be treated as a journalist and that, as a foreign national, the First Amendment does not apply to him. The First Amendment does not shield the press from liability for criminal wrongdoing like that alleged by the U.S. government in the charges against Assange.

"These are ordinary criminal charges and any person, journalist or source who hacks or attempts to gain unauthorized access to a secure system or aids and abets others to do so is guilty of computer misuse," Lewis said. Assange is accused of conspiring with the former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to leak the classified documents.

Evidence for the hearing will be heard in May and June and if Assange is extradited to the U.S. he could face a 175-year prison sentence if found guilty on all the charges and the maximum sentence is imposed. Fitzgerald said that Assange's extradition case was going ahead "because of the political opinions that he holds" and that in the U.S. he would likely be subject to lengthy solitary confinement and other degrading conditions.

If Assange is extradited to the U.S., he will be tried in the same court – the Eastern District of Virginia – as John Kiriakou, a former CIA analyst who blew the whistle on a U.S. government-sanctioned torture program in 2007 that was approved by President George W. Bush because of the feared threats posed by the al-Qaeda terrorist organization. "It's known as the 'espionage court,'" said Kiriakou in an interview, adding that "Assange doesn't stand a chance" in that federal district court because the jury pool tilts toward individuals who are members of the U.S. intelligence community and their families.

Assange has been held in Belmarsh Prison on the outskirts of London since September last year after a judge ruled that he was a flight risk ahead of the extradition hearing. He was jailed in May for skipping bail after he fled to Ecuador's embassy in London and stayed there for seven years to avoid extradition to Sweden, where authorities wanted to question him over sexual assault allegations. The investigation was later dropped.

Human rights organizations and Assange's legal team have argued his extradition should be blocked for, among other reasons, his fragile mental health. Fitzgerald said there was no doubt Assange "would find a way to commit suicide" if sent to the U.S.

Fitzgerald said it was "very unlikely" that Assange himself would testify in court.

However, he did appear in court on Monday. He was dressed in a gray blazer and gray sweater. He looked relaxed. His reading glasses were perched on his head. At one point, he stood up to inform the court that he was having problems concentrating and also hearing the proceedings because of the chants from several dozen of his supporters who were making noise outside the courtroom in the pouring rain.

"I do understand they must be disgusted by these proceedings," he told the judge.
