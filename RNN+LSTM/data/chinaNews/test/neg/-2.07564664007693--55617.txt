OTTAWA – Canada’s ambassador to China told MPs Wednesday evening there is a “chill” between the two countries and it began with the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.

Ambassador Dominic Barton was appointed in September to represent Canada in Beijing, but he said the decline in the relationship happened when Meng was arrested in December 2018.

“There was a massive change. Things had been moving quite well. The chill is real,” he told a special House of Commons committee studying the fraught relationship between the two countries.

Meng’s arrest was followed swiftly in China by the arrests of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, and to a re-sentencing of Canadian Robert Schellenberg who was handed a death penalty in a hastily scheduled appeal hearing, after he had been sentenced to prison time months prior.

Barton said those three men are his top priority and the issue has come to define the relationship.

“The first conversation I had there was probably one of the most unpleasant conversations I have ever had.”

He said the government has kept up talks with the Chinese officials and there is some slight opening.

“I hope now we do actually have some channels and we can have real conversations,” he said.

Before Barton’s appointment, the ambassadorship had been vacant since January 2019, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired former cabinet minister John McCallum after he made comments that broke with the government’s message.

Barton was a managing director with the consulting company McKinsey and Co. and previously served on Trudeau’s economic advisory council.

Conservative MP Garnett Genuis questioned him extensively about his work with the consulting firm and said that made him the wrong choice for ambassador.

“I felt you are an inappropriate choice as an ambassador,” Genuis said opening his remarks.

Genuis said Barton’s work at McKinsey put him in a conflict of interest.

“You advised almost two dozen state-owned Chinese companies,” he said.

Genuis focused on McKinsey’s consulting work for a Chinese company that constructed islands in the South China sea in an effort to expand the country’s territorial waters. He also pointed out to reports the company held a conference within a few miles of an internment camp in China.

“Are you comfortable that all of these things were happening when you were setting the policy direction?” asked Genuis.

Barton said the company was unaware of the camp when it held the conference.

“I am very proud of my career and time in the private sector with McKinsey and the work that we did,” he said. “We are known for telling truth to power.”

Liberal MP Rob Oliphant defended Barton and said the hearing shouldn’t become a U.S. style confirmation hearing.

“Everything about this appointment has been for the best interest of Canada.”

Barton said he has visited the detained Canadians multiple times and makes a point of going personally.

“I am going to go every single time that I am allowed to go and visit,” he said.

I hope that our efforts are soon going to bear fruit

The three men have all been held in detention, while Meng has been on house arrest. She was arrested on a U.S. extradition request and a hearing on that case began last month.

He didn’t provide any specifics, but said he was hopeful Canada’s effort to secure the men’s release could lead to change soon.

“I hope that our efforts are soon going to bear fruit.”

More broadly, Barton said if the issue can be resolved, there is room for Canada to play a bigger role in China.

“Whether you like China or don’t like China it is going to play a very important role and we need to build our competencies,” he said. “China needs a lot of things that we have and I think we could play an influential role in how the society evolves.”

The Liberals voted against striking the special committee on the Canada-China relationship, which was the Conservatives first move in parliament after the election and was the Liberals first loss in the minority parliament.
