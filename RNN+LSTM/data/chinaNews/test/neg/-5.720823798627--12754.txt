Islamabad: After months of running a smear campaign against India in raising the Kashmir issue at international forums, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan finally admitted that the global community’s response to the issue has been tepid.

In an interview to DW, the German state-owned broadcaster, Khan said there has been a “lukewarm response” to the issue asserting that “commercial interests are more important for the Western countries”.

"Unfortunately, commercial interests are more important for Western countries. India is a big market and that is the reason behind the lukewarm response to what is happening to some 8 million people in Kashmir, as well as to minorities in India," he said.

Khan said India snubbed his repeated overtures for settling the ongoing disputes between the nuclear-armed rivals. He gave the reference of his first speech wherein Khan said he is willing to take two steps forward for the step that India takes towards normalising relations.

“Sadly, yes. Consider the sort of media attention the Hong Kong protests are getting. The tragedy of Kashmir is much greater," Khan told DW's Ines Pohl.

Khan dedicated a major part of the interview on discussing relations with India and New Delhi’s move to abrogate Article 370 which he said was driven by the “extremist” Hindutva ideology of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

"The RSS, a political organisation founded in 1925, was inspired by the German Nazis, and its founding fathers believed in racial supremacy. Just as the Nazi ideology was built on hatred for minorities, the RSS ideology is also based on hatred for Muslims and other minorities, including Christians," he told DW.

Khan’s statement comes within a day of its ally China raising the Kashmir issue in a closed-door meeting of the UN Security Council.

India, on the very next day, issued a statement on China “misusing” the platform.

Ministry of External Affairs (MHA) spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said Beijing should refrain from such action in future and seriously reflect on global consensus (on the matter).

“An attempt was made by Pakistan, through a UNSC member, to misuse the platform,” the MEA spokesperson said on China's latest bid to raise Kashmir at the UNSC. “An overwhelming majority of the UNSC was of the view that it was not the right forum for such issues,” he added.

“The informal closed-door meeting concluded without any outcome. Pakistan's desperate attempt to peddle baseless allegation and show an alarming scenario failed as it lacked credibility,” Kumar added
