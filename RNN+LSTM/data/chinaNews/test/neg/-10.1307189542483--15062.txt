A live pig was forced to bungee jump from a tower as part of a theme park's publicity stunt in China.

A Chinese theme park forced a live pig to wear a cape and "bungee jump" off a platform as part of a stunt that aimed to attract more visitors.

The stunt has triggered widespread criticism with many concern after the pig was forced from the 68-metre tower, the BBC reported.

Videos have been shared online showing the 75kg pig with its hooves tied together. It was also tied to a pole as it was carried to the platform, and had a purple cape tied to its back. In some videos, squealing pig sounds can reportedly be heard as the animal plunges towards the ground, the UK media site reported.

The Chongqing-based theme park in south-west China said the stunt was to mark the opening of the new attraction, and has since apologised for its actions, the BBC reported.
