SEN. Christopher “Bong” Go on Sunday said President Rodrigo Duterte has agreed to widen the travel ban against Chinese visitors to include all travelers coming from anywhere in China.

He however stressed that the Philippine government is not singling out Chinese in its travel ban amid the threat of the deadly 2019 coronavirus.

The senator said the order “covered all travelers from China to the Philippines, regardless of nationality.”





The deadly nCoV originated in Wuhan, the capital of the Hubei province in China with 11 million population.

“We empathize with China given what they are going through but we are doing this to protect the country and its people,” Go said in a statement.

“The Philippine government is committed to help China and other affected countries address this worldwide health concern,” he said.

“During my discussion with President Rodrigo Duterte last Saturday night on the government’s efforts to address the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease situation, I recommended to the President to implement a temporary travel ban on travelers coming from any part of China and its Special Administrative Regions.”

“This was on top of the existing temporary travel ban imposed on those coming from Hubei province and other affected areas,” Go said.
