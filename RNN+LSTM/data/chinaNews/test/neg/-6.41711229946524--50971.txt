The World Health Organization is "the most scientific, authoritative organization (on health issues), and I believe that we can base our decisions on WHO recommendations," Xing said.

Xing, who only arrived here last week wearing a surgical mask, called for public support but declined to comment on Seoul's travel restrictions from Wuhan and surrounding Hubei Province effective since Tuesday.

New Chinese Ambassador to South Korea Xing Haiming on Tuesday gave a press conference at the Chinese Embassy on the coronavirus outbreak in the world's most populous country.

He also expressed thanks for Seoul's assistance to China after Korea sent some 2 million masks and other medical supplies to Wuhan along with US$5 million in aid to help the country fight the outbreak. Korea, "through various channels, has sent messages supporting China in its fight against the contagious disease," he said. "We will not forget this warm support."

The government hopes that Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit Seoul in June once the coronavirus scare is over.

A day earlier, Beijing harshly criticized Washington for banning Chinese visitors. "There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel," said Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. She added the U.S. has "inappropriately overreacted."

Meanwhile, Korea on Tuesday confirmed its 16th case of coronavirus infection. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the patient is a woman in her early 40s who had returned from a trip to Thailand on Jan. 19 and started feeling sick about a week later. Her condition has not improved and she tested positive for the disease on Tuesday.
