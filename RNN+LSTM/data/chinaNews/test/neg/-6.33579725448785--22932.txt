The new virus spreading in China has millions of people on lockdown and scientists scrambling to find out more about the outbreak.

Officials in China first told the World Health Organization about the outbreak in the city of Wuhan last month. They determined it to be a coronavirus, which is common in animals and can sometimes infect humans.

The coronavirus has killed 170 people and infected roughly 7,700 more, according to a real-time map of the outbreaks from U.S. researchers.

The World Health Organization has said the outbreak could become a “global health emergency.”

What is the Wuhan coronavirus?

Scientists haven't seen the virus before, but they believe it is similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.

It can spread from person to person, according to a new study based on initial clinical data on the virus.

Many of the cases were linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, but the origin of the virus is still unknown.

Most patients who were admitted to hospitals with the virus between Dec. 16, 2019, and Jan. 2 were healthy, middle-aged men who had visited the seafood market, according to the study, which was published Friday in the journal The Lancet.

They reported a range of symptoms, but almost all experienced pneumonia and most had a fever, cough and fatigue. Over half experienced shortness of breath.

Of the 41 patients analyzed in the study, six died and 28 were discharged as of Jan. 22. The rest remain hospitalized.

A second study also published Friday in the journal looked at a family of seven who were admitted to a hospital with unexplained pneumonia. They found that one of the children had the coronavirus but did not show any symptoms, which suggests some people could spread the virus without realizing they're infected.

"Our findings are consistent with person-to person transmission of this new coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other countries," Yuen Kwok-yung, an infectious diseases expert who led the research, said in a statement.

He said that controlling the virus will "rely on isolating patients, tracing and quarantining contacts as early as possible, educating the public on both food and personal hygiene, and ensuring healthcare workers comply with infection control."

Authors of both the studies warn that their results are limited due to the small number of cases analyzed.

Where is the Wuhan coronavirus?

The vast majority of confirmed cases are in mainland China, with relatively few found in other areas, including Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, Vietnam, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia, France, Canada, Germany, Nepal and the U.S.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed on Sunday that there are five cases of coronavirus in the U.S. across four states: Arizona, California, Illinois and Washington.

"This is a very serious public health situation. We understand that some people are worried about this virus and how it may impact Americans," the CDC said in a press release.

Officials said they expect more cases to be found in the U.S. in the coming days and weeks, but they believe the risk to the American public is low at this time.

Who should be concerned?

The virus is a global concern, but officials say there is much unknown about it.

"Make no mistake, this is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of WHO, said at a press conference last week. "WHO's risk assessment is that the outbreak is a very high risk in China and a high risk regionally and globally."

China is restricting travel for more than 60 million people to try to contain the outbreak. All public transportation in and out of Wuhan is shut down. The country also extended the Lunar New Year holiday to try to limit travel.

There is no vaccine to protect against the virus, and no specific treatment has been developed yet.

Scientists warn it is hard to understand the death rate of the virus because more mild cases might not be noticed yet. Only the most severe cases are being detected at the start of the outbreak.

Officials suggest avoiding travel to Wuhan. If people are travelling to China, the CDC recommends regular hand washing and avoiding contact with anyone who is sick.
