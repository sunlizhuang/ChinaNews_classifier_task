Macau News Agency decided to gather a list of the jurisdictions that have so far also included Macau SAR residents or travellers that passed through the city, according to information from the International Air Transport Association and the National Immigration Administration of the People’s Republic of China.

When contacted about this issue the Tourism Crisis Management Office stated that “due to the constant developments concerning immigration procedures adopted by different countries” it recommends Macau residents to inquire their travel agents and the closest Consular Missions of the country they plan to travel to in order to obtain the latest information”.
