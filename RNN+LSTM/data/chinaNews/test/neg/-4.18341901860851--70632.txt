A new virus tracker has revealed the crucial seven-day window in which the deadly coronavirus swept across the world and exploded into a global health emergency.

The new SARS-like disease, now officially named COVID-19, was first reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) by Chinese authorities on December 31.

Three weeks later, it had spread from the epicentre in Wuhan to three other countries in Asia: Thailand, South Korea and Japan.

But it was on January 24 that the crisis truly began to go global, according to Edward Parker, a research fellow in systems biology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

He and a team of researchers have developed a new online tool to visually track the outbreak as it spreads across the world.

Using data from the WHO, red markers are added to an interactive map as each new country reports a confirmed case.

But you can also “wind back the clock” and review what the global situation was on any given day of the outbreak starting from January 20.

“Our hope is that this tool will provide more context to the daily headlines and a fresh perspective on key turning points in the disease’s history,” Mr Parker wrote in an article for The Conversation this week.

TRACKING THE VIRUS

According to Mr Parker, the major turning point for the virus took place over the week from January 24 – 31.

“By tracing the course of the outbreak, it is clear that the last week of January was pivotal for the international spread of the virus,” he said.

“In the space of a few days, the number of affected countries increased from seven to 20, while the number of confirmed cases outside China increased almost tenfold, from 11 to 106.”

Here’s what the spread looked like:

On January 24, about 850 cases of the virus had been detected in seven countries. The next day, that figure jumped to more than 1300 in 10 countries.

By Australia Day, the virus had spread to both Australia and Europe, and the total number of countries affected rose to 12 on January 27.

On January 28, the number of cases across the world had spiked to 4593 across 15 countries, and 106 people had died.

Two days later, the WHO declared the virus a global health emergency, with 19 countries, including Germany, India, Sri Lanka and the Philippines, impacted.

On the last day of January, Italy became the 20th country to confirm it had been hit.

VIRUS SPREAD SLOWING?

Tens of thousands of cases of the virus have now been reported across 25 countries and 1384 people have died.

But Mr Parker said it was a promising sign that only a few more countries had reported cases since the beginning of February.

“A testament to the rapid, co-ordinated international response to this new threat,” he wrote.

Chinese officials are hopeful the epidemic may be plateauing. China’s National Health Commission spokesman, Mi Feng, said while the situation was still grim, they had “seen some positive changes”.

“I’m going to be optimistic that is a sign that their aggressive actions have been effective, but I really do think it’s too soon to say that for sure, not having hands on the data ourselves,” Dr Nancy Messonnier of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

However others have warned the quarantine efforts have been “too little too late”

According to The New York Post, doctors have been testing for the disease by taking uncomfortable swabs from the very back of patients’ noses and throats.

“It’s uncomfortable for maybe five or 10 seconds,” New York doctor Lewis Kohl said.

But he added that in some rare cases, doctors were having to “go deeper” and take mucous samples from “hard-to-reach parts of the respiratory tract” which involved spraying a saline solution into a person’s lungs.

“The saline is a really salty fluid that causes you to bring up sputum — big yellow goobers deep in your lungs,” he said.

“That can be unpleasant because you’re forcing someone to inhale this nasty stuff.”

Testing for the flu, by comparison, only requires a simple swap from the mouth.

NEWBORN BABIES TEST NEGATIVE

There was some good news for pregnant women on Friday though, with a new study reporting there was “no evidence” yet that the virus could be passed from mother to baby.

The study looked at nine pregnant women who all had the COVID-19 virus and delivered via cesarean section in a hospital in Wuhan.

After the babies were born, scientists tested samples from the newborns, including the amniotic fluid, cord blood and throat swabs, and all tested negative for the virus.

But the scientists acknowledged the study was small.

To date, two cases of the virus have been confirmed in babies, including a newborn diagnosed just 36 hours after birth. It is unknown how the child was infected.
