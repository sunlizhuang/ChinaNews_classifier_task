The Romance Writers of America has canceled the 2020 RITAs, the organization’s annual awards program. The cancellation is the latest public sign of crisis amid a tumultuous month for the Houston-based organization, which has been losing a public relations battle over the diversity of its membership and the content it produces. This week the RWA also received a petition to recall its board president. On Wednesday Renee Ryan, its director-at-large, resigned from the board of directors.

Over the past month, a best-selling author was censured, several board members resigned and the future of an organization that represents some 9,000 writers has been thrown into doubt during what should have been a celebratory 40th anniversary year. The RWA describes its mission as advancing “the professional and common business interests of career-focused romance writers through networking and advocacy.”

The cancellation was announced Wednesday, the same day HarperCollins Canada and its Harlequin imprint announced they would not attend the RWA’s national conference this year. Craig Swinwood, CEO of the publisher, said it would reevaluate its involvement in 2021.

“We at Harlequin believe it is important that all authors feel included, respected and heard,” he wrote.

Last week the prominent Nancy Yost Literary Agency withdrew its membership from the RWA.

The RWA also announced on Jan. 6 that it has received a recall petition for board president Damon Suede. If the petition is verified, a recall election would take place before Feb. 20.

Signs of discontent in this $1 billion industry began to occur a few years ago. Courtney Milan - the pen name for writer Heidi Bond - had been critical of the organization’s lack of diversity in the past. A Californian with Chinese ancestry, Milan formerly served as an RWA board member and advocated for a more inclusive and diverse RWA.

But her August 2019 tweet about a book published more than two decades ago proved a more dramatic catalyst for change than years of advice and advocacy. Milan called “Somewhere Lies the Moon,” a book by author Kathryn Lynn Davis “a racist (expletive) mess” for its portrayal of a half-Chinese heroine. Davis and her publisher filed a complaint with the RWA, which censured Milan last month.

Davis in a recent interview with the Guardian suggested she was urged to file the complaint by the Romance Writers of America, further obscuring an already unclear sequence of events. Early reports also said Davis lost a three-book publishing deal as a result of the controversy; she since clarified interview that a formal contract had not been offered, but rather discussions about a deal had halted.

Davis declined to comment further.

In a statement, Milan - an attorney who had received a service award last year from the RWA for her work to improve systemic racism in the industry - took offense that a new ethics committee was assembled by the RWA to hear the complaint. She said of the lack of transparency, “this entire matter has been a massive breach of fiduciary duty.”

Milan’s suspension was swiftly rescinded by the RWA, but the fallout was irreversible. If the RWA hoped the controversy wouldn’t find oxygen on Christmas Eve, it was mistaken. Several board members resigned on Dec. 24 in solidarity with Milan. A holiday week did nothing to extinguish flames as a resilient and often marginalized industry found itself drawing attention outside its ranks.

The roots of the Romance Writers of America are traced back to Houston, where Vivian Stephens - a New York-based editor at Dell - appeared at the Southwest Writer’s Conference in 1979. A Houston native, Stephens advised a group of romance writers to organize, and the RWA formally began the following year, quickly growing to nearly 40 members. The RWA’s first conference was held in 1981 in Houston and became an annual event. Houston, then as now, served as the headquarters for the RWA.

Stephens was also a rare person of color among editors in book publishing at the time. And at Dell, she quickly sought to diversify the publisher’s output, releasing “Entwined Destinies” by Rosalind Welles in 1980.

The idea she seeded in Houston grew quickly. Despite its popularity among readers, genre fiction at the time was ill-treated within the industry, and romance particularly so. The organization offered a comfortable space for writers, editors and readers of romance fiction, which flourished.

Membership today is estimated between 9,000 and 10,000. General membership includes annual dues of $99.

And romance over the years has endured where some other genre fiction - like the western - has seen attrition. Romance represented about a third of the 2015 fiction market with sales in excess of $1 billion.

As the organization grew, though, complaints about its insular membership also swelled as the romance industry published thousands of titles but very few representing by authors of color and very few with characters of color.

Author Piper Huguley commented two years ago about the absence of black writers among the RITA-nominated works. She told the Chronicle last month, “I knew there was a big push coming, a resistance against this.”

The RWA issued a statement in late December calling the crisis “a turning point.”

“We would like to take this time to provide clarity and a path forward,” it read.

So far writers are awaiting both, though the RWA has been regularly updating its website with statements about the ongoing crisis. The RWA did announce that it hired the Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman law firm to conduct an independent audit of its code of ethics “and to make recommendations on appropriate adjustments moving forward on ethics policy and procedures.”

Milan opted not to be interviewed for this story. But she tweeted that the RITA cancellation was “the first right decision I’ve seen the RWA make in this whole debacle.”

Several writers critical of the RWA have expressed their hope that the organization can be improved rather than having it split into factions. Huguley expressed her concern that starting a new organization would be a financially fraught option.

Milan, in a statement, said, “I am heartbroken that an organization that I served for four years has decided to set itself on fire in a win for absolutely nobody.”
