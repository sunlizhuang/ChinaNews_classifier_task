The car was in drive and her foot was on the brake.

CANTON Police arrested a woman found asleep behind the wheel of her car with her car in drive and her foot on the brake as two small children sat in the back seat .

The 28-year-old woman was arrested shortly after 3 a.m. Sunday where police found her at Sixth Street and Cleveland Avenue SW, Stark County Jail records show.

Police could not be reached early Monday for information about what happened to the children, ages 1 and 3, or whether they were her children.

But jail records show the woman was booked into the jail on a misdemeanor charge of endangering children. (The Canton Repository does not typically name misdemeanor crime suspects.)

She was later released from the jail after posting $164 bond, pending a Canton Municipal Court hearing.
