Researchers have sprung into action to develop a coronavirus vaccine and thanks to technological advances, an early-stage trial is expected soon, according to a Thai researcher whose team detected the coronavirus strain in Horseshoe bats in Thailand.

The team has been credited with identifying the strain of Wuhan coronavirus based on samples taken from a Chinese individual who arrived in Thailand from China.

"When we collect samples, we run them against the coronavirus and all other strains of influenza. The sample collected from the Chinese individual on Jan 8 tested positive for coronavirus but negative for influenza."

"That's when we suspected it belonged to the coronavirus family. We ran genetic tests and realised it was very close to a strain found in bats," said Supaporn Watcharaprueksadee, deputy-director at the Centre for Emerging Infectious Diseases of Thailand, Chulalongkorn University.

She said an early-stage trial for the coronavirus vaccine in animals, known as a phase-1 trial, should begin soon and that it would take another three to six months to evaluate the results.

"I think Thailand and other countries are working to develop a vaccine but it is likely to take more time than a vaccine for a new strain of influenza. This is a new virus, a new illness," she said.

While a vaccine for commercial use is still months or even years away, Ms Supaporn said it is important to have a quick diagnostic test for the virus. If the virus is detected early, it becomes easier to limit or contain its spread.

"Patients can be isolated and screening be more accurate. It also reduces cases of unnecessary quarantines and eases crowding in hospitals," she said.

She said suspected cases of coronavirus will have to be confirmed by Chulalongkorn Hospital and the Department of Medical Sciences. The confirmation done by the virus's genetic code is the most effective.

The Centre for Emerging Infectious Diseases of Thailand, Chulalongkorn University and the Department of Medical Sciences under the Public Health Ministry have been working together on the emergence of new diseases since Ebola.

According to Ms Supaporn, the Centre for Emerging Infectious Diseases of Thailand was also the first to detect the virus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers).

Ms Supaporn also explained how the centre's lab detected the coronavirus after being alerted about the spread of an unknown disease in Wuhan, China in December last year.

At that time the cause of the disease was unknown and as the number of infections rose, the Department of Diseases Control stepped up its efforts to screen travellers by installing thermal scanners at airports.
