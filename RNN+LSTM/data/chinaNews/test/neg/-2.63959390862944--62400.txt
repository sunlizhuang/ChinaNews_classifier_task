All schools across Connecticut recently received new guidance about the coronavirus as it continues to spread.

A U.S. citizen recently died in Wuhan, the city in China at the epicenter of the outbreak, and is being reported as the apparent first American death from the virus.

While there have been a few cases of individuals being monitored for the virus in Connecticut, there have been no positive coronavirus test results in the state.

However, just last week a Massachusetts resident tested positive for the virus.

The state Department of Public Health provided a question and answer-style document to schools statewide, providing information on what coronavirus is and ways to avoid contracting it.

The DPH said it and local health departments and districts are involved in weekly national conference calls with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are also weekly state conference calls to exchange information as it pertains to the state and local communities.

“Education is vital in our efforts to reduce the spread of this and any illness,” the DPH said in a Thursday news release. “Outbreaks involving novel coronaviruses evolve quickly and recommendations from public health officials may change frequently as new information becomes available.”

The information provided, the DPH said, was based on the Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential 2019-nCoV Exposure in Travel-Associated or Community Settings from the CDC.

The guidance applies to people who returned to the United States on or after Feb. 3 and spent time in mainland China during the 14 days before arriving in the U.S.

The following is the information shared with Connecticut schools earlier this week.

What is the coronavirus?

Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that commonly circulate throughout the world, including in Connecticut.

The cause illness ranging symptoms similar to the common cold to more serious illness that prompt hospitalization. Reported illnesses from the coronavirus have ranged from mild to severe.

Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.

How does it spread?

Current information indicates that the coronavirus spread by person-to-person interaction, although it isn’t clear how easily it spreads from one person to the next.

The first confirmed person-to-person case in the United States was reported in Illinois on Jan. 30. Those people were living in the same home, officials said.

CDC officials believe the symptoms of the coronavirus can appear anywhere from two days to 14 days after exposure.

Lab testing for the coronavirus will only be done when a traveler that is sick meets all of the CDC criteria for persons under investigation for coronavirus.

What happens if you travel to China and return to the U.S.?

Eleven airports in the country are enforcing the following protocol. As of this week, Bradley International Airport is not one of those airports.

Any person who spent time in mainland China within 14 days of arriving in the U.S. is asked questions about their travel and whether they have been in contact with anyone with the virus.

Those travelers will also have their temperature taken and are asked questions about their health.

People who have been in Hubei Providence, China — where Wuhan is located — and are sick are not allowed to continue to their final destinations.

If a traveler has not been to the Hubei Providence and have no symptoms, they are given information about self-monitoring and are allowed to continue to their final destinations.

For any travel who arrived on or after Feb. 3, the health department at their destination is notified and will contact the traveler to discuss self-monitoring and other necessary recommendations.

Those self-monitoring should take their temperature twice daily and watch for a cough or difficulty breathing. They should also practice social isolation — staying home and remaining out of public places, including work or school.

Family members who weren’t in China can remain in school and work as long as the person who traveled to China has no symptoms.

What can schools do?

Schools across Connecticut are urged to stay informed, listen to public health messages and implement good public health practices to prevent the spread of illnesses.

“Avoid stigmatizing people who have recently traveled to China,” the DPH guidelines said.

Schools should contact their local health department with any questions about exclusion of students or staff who have traveled or their family members, or if anyone self-reports illness or travel.

If a student or staff member has traveled to China in the last 14 days and comes down with a fever, cough or difficult breathing, they should separate the student or staff member from other students and staff until they can be picked up to go home or to a medical provider.

If possible, the person with symptoms should be given a face mask.

The student or staff member should be urged to seek medical care at an emergency department. Before going there, the school or family should call ahead to inform them about recent travel and symptoms so they can be treated appropriately immediately.

While the person is sick, the school should encourage them to remain home except to go to the doctor.

When coughing or sneezing, students and staff should use a tissue or sleeve. Tissues should be thrown out in a lined trash can.

Students and staff should be reminded to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

School staff should clean and disinfect frequently-touched surfaces ad objects.

The same steps to prevent other respiratory viruses, including the flu, from spreading can also prevent the coronavirus from spreading.
