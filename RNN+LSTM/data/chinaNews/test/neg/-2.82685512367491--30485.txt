HIT AND RUN TRIAL

The wife of the accused testified yesterday at the hit and run trial in Moncton of Maurice Johnson in the death of Brady Francis in Saint Charles the night of February 24th 2018.

Jacinthe Johnson testified she and her husband thought they had hit a deer.

They looked behind them but didn’t see anything. They didn’t get out and look because she didn’t want to see a dead deer and they drove home.

The next morning they heard Brady Francis had been hit and went to the police station but no one was there. They drove home and called 9-1-1. Police arrived and took their statements then told them Francis had died.

The defense will continue presenting its case today.

DAY SCHOOLS SETTLEMENT

Survivors of the 12 Indian day schools in New Brunswick can now apply for compensation.

Paryse Suddith, a lawyer helping the claimants, tells CBC Indigenous people have until 2022 to apply for compensation for the abuse they suffered at the Day Schools operated by the Roman Catholic Church on or near First Nations Communities. A settlement was announced in March last year after a ten year legal battle in a class-action lawsuit. Suddith says it was “a collective trauma that will take generations to heal.”

The last day school to close was in Metepenagiag, near Miramichi, in 1992.

NURSE PRACTITIONERS

The province is expanding the use of new nurse practitioner clinics in an effort to reduce wait times.

It’s hiring 18 nurse practitioners to staff new clinics in Fredericton and Saint John as well as a clinic in Moncton set up as a pilot project last March.

Another six will be hired where needed as part of a move the province says will cut the provincial waitlist for a family doctor in half.

Eight other nurse practitioners are being added to reduce wait times at four hospital emergency room departments in Fredericton, Saint John and two in Moncton.

CORONAVIRUS

Ottawa is trying to calm concerns about the coronavirus in Canada.

With a second presumptive case here, federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu (HY’-do) says there is no reason for Canadians to be alarmed.

Hajdu told the House of Commons that, while there is no vaccine available yet, scientists do know the makeup of the virus and are working on one with international health experts.

Health officials in Toronto say the wife of an infected patient who also returned recently from China has also contracted the illness.

Meanwhile the death toll in China has risen dramatically to at least 106.

ELECTRIC VEHICLE SUBSIDIES

The Federal rebate program to encourage Canadians to buy electric cars is more popular than expected.

Transport Minister Marc Garneau allocated $300-million over three years to the program last May. Nearly half of it has been spoken for in just the first eight months.

More than 33,000 Canadians have received rebates of between $2,500 and $5,000 when they bought eligible electric and hybrid vehicles.
