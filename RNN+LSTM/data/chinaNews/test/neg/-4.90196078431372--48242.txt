Thirty six people aboard an evacuation flight from China that landed in France on Sunday showed symptoms of the Wuhan coronavirus, Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said.

In all, 254 people arrived in France from Wuhan, on the second such flight.

"About 20 people who presented symptoms have stayed on the tarmac" at Istres airport in the south of France to undergo further testing, Buzyn said. They included French and non-European nationals. Tests were done to establish whether they were infected and the results will be known today, the health ministry told AFP.

A further 16 foreign nationals displaying symptoms were flown back to their respective countries.

The second evacuation flight was carrying people of 30 different nationalities, most of them European. Sixty five of the returnees were French.

A total of 124 non-French evacuees swiftly traveled on to their home countries, according to military sources in Istres.

Nine Belgians and three of their partners as well as 15 Dutch citizens and their two Chinese partners were isolated after travelling on from Istres to a military airport near Brussels, according to Belga news agency.

However, 60 others from Mexico, Rwanda, Brazil and Georgia remained on French soil, Buzyn told reporters.
