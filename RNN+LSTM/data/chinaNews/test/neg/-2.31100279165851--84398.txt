(Natural News) For the past almost 20 years, the United States government has been using your tax dollars (assuming you’re an American taxpayer) to fund research and development into vaccines and other pharmaceuticals for the coronavirus family of pathogens. And if history is any indicator, the end result of this massive financial disbursement will be obscene profits for Big Pharma, and expensive drugs for you and your family.

A new report by Public Citizen explains that the “race” has been on to develop new drug-based treatments for coronaviruses ever since the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis of 2002, followed by MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) in 2012, and now the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19).

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), the report explains, has played a “singular role” in making sure that your hard-earned income makes it into the coffers of the pharmaceutical industry, which continues to argue that its monopoly-based patent system for synthetic treatments “is the most effective tool to reward and incentivize innovation.”

Big Pharma further argues that, despite having to rely upon the general public to fund its self-centered R&D efforts, this is all worthwhile because it “fulfills the promise of breakthroughs in treatments and cures for … scores of debilitating or life-threatening illnesses around the world.”

Keep in mind that unpatented natural remedies remain largely off-limits because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is bed-buddies with Big Pharma, prohibits their use under the guise that they’re “unsubstantiated” and “unproven” for medicinal use.

The only option, in other words, are patented synthetics, which wouldn’t even exist were it not for back-door dealings that transfer the wealth of American taxpayers into the coffers of the pharmaceutical industry, which Public Citizen argues isn’t even putting it to good use when it comes to the fight against infectious diseases.

“… the monopoly model has not driven significant industry investment in infectious diseases, including coronaviruses,” the report explains. “Last year, there were only six active coronavirus clinical trials involving pharmaceutical companies. All of them depended crucially on public funding.”

Listen below as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how the release of the new Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) was an intentional deployment by communist China of a deadly bioweapon aimed at the destruction of America:

Big Pharma doesn’t care about helping people, only about lining its pockets with cash

The problem with trying to fight infectious diseases using the typical pharmaceutical model is that there’s much more profit to be had in developing “blockbuster” treatments for persistent illnesses as opposed to isolated outbreaks. Thus, Big Pharma is almost solely focused on the latter, public health be damned.

When it comes to the fundamentals of the pharmaceutical industry, in other words, it’s all about the money, baby. Big Pharma executives couldn’t care less if millions or even billions of people die, just so long as the profits continue to flow from other lucrative drug offerings, including childhood vaccines that are now mandated in many areas with minimal exceptions.

Now, if Big Pharma can somehow be assured by Big Fed that people will be forced at gunpoint to receive a patented coronavirus vaccine at some point in the future, then that’s a whole different story. If this were the case, every pharmaceutical company in America would be rushing to create their own varieties due to the surety of windfall profits.

“The public sector has helped drive the CoVid-19 response,” Public Citizen states. “We cannot rely on industry’s monopoly model to deliver the medicines we need.”
