Coronavirus researchers have created a live map which tracks the spread of the killer SARS-like bug in real time.

Britain confirmed its first two cases on Friday, with health chiefs saying the patients are from the same family and tested positive in England.

The live map shows locations where cases have been reported in China and more than 15 other countries around the world.

So far, the flu-like virus has killed more than 210 people in China and infected more than 9,800 others, mainly in central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan.

More than 80 Britons who were trapped in the city of 11 million will be quarantined at a UK military base for 14 days after a repatriation flight lands on Friday afternoon.

The live map was created by researchers at Johns Hopkins University in the US.

Outside of China, 14 confirmed cases have been reported in Thailand, 11 in Japan and 10 in Singapore.

Australia has seven, France and the US have five each, and Germany has four.

Johns Hopkins' live map uses data from the World Health Organisation and the US Centers for Disease Control.

Prof Lauren Gardner, who helped to create the map, said: “We built this dashboard because we think it is important for the public to have an understanding of the outbreak situation as it unfolds with transparent data sources.

“For the research community, this data will become more valuable as we continue to collect it over time.”

Britain 'most at risk of outbreak in Europe'

Britain confirmed its first two cases on Friday.

Earlier, experts at Southampton University had found that a coronavirus outbreak was more likely in Britain than any other country in Europe.

More than 142,000 tourists arrive in London alone between January and the middle of March every year.

Researchers at Southampton University measured the potential global spread for the first time, finding the UK was the most "at-risk" nation on the continent.

Globally, it was ranked 17th, after the US (6th) and Australia (10th) - with London the 19th most vulnerable city across the world.

Thailand, which has the most cases outside of China as of Friday morning, topped the list of countries most at risk.

The findings are based on the number of air travellers predicted to arrive from the worst affected cities in mainland China.

Paris was 27th on the list and Frankfurt was 30th - despite cases having been confirmed in France and Germany already.

Professor Andrew Tatem, director of a health project called WorldPop, said: "It's vital we understand patterns of population movement - both within China and globally - in order to assess how this new virus might spread domestically and internationally.

"By mapping these trends and identifying high-risk areas, we can help inform public health interventions, such as screenings and healthcare preparedness."

His team found Thailand's capital Bangkok is currently the city most at risk from a global spread of the virus.

Hong Kong is second followed by Taipei in Taiwan. Sydney comes 12th and New York 16th.
