Two Chinese passengers who were in quarantine for fever symptoms upon their arrival in Da Nang this week have been discharged after doctors determined their conditions are not related to a pneumonia outbreak in China.

Xiong Tianzuo, 23, who hails from Wuhan in China, arrived at Da Nang International Airport in the namesake central Vietnamese city on Tuesday.

The Chinese national was detected with high body temperature by non-contact body temperature meters, which were installed at the airdrome following an order by the health ministry’s General Department of Preventive Medicine last week.

Along with Xiong, another child from Wuhan was also found with high body temperature at the same time.

Xiong and the child were immediately isolated for health checks while passengers who had been seated near the two Chinese nationals on the same flight were also examined.

The child was later determined as merely suffering from a heatstroke from the flight and discharged from quarantine.

Meanwhile, Xiong had his samples collected and sent to the Nha Trang Pasteur Institute in the south-central province of Khanh Hoa for testing.

Test results found that the Chinese’ condition is not linked to the pneumonia cases in Wuhan City, located in China’s central province of Hubei, said Nguyen Tien Hong, deputy director of the Da Nang Department of Health.

“Although this patient comes from Wuhan and was detected with a fever of 38 degrees Celsius [his condition] is not related to acute pneumonia,” Hong said.

According to Hong, the Chinese patient was discharged from quarantine on Thursday.

Dozens have so far been diagnosed with a new pneumonia-like virus in Wuhan.

Two people have died from the illness in China as of Friday.

The Chinese outbreak of pneumonia appears to be linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan City’s center, where multiple pneumonia patients worked.

The market is still cordoned off after being shut down on Jan 1.

The World Health Organization warned on Tuesday that there could be a wider outbreak, and that it is possible the virus may have “limited human-to-human transmission.”
