The song’s video has so far logged over 900,000 views since it was posted on China’s Twitter-like social media app Weibo, via China Daily’s official Weibo account on Sunday. “Our hearts are with our motherland wherever we are,” read one comment under the video, among hundreds of others.

In addition, Chinese students at Berklee are planning to partner with students from other universities in Boston and hold charity concerts to raise money for epidemic-stricken areas. Their plan is endorsed by the college, which will offer on-campus venues for the concerts.
