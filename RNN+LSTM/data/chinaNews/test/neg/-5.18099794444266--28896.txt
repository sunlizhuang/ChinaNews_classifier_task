The first case of the deadly coronavirus has been confirmed in Germany as deaths in China rocketed past 100.

The rising death toll came as the Chinese capital also announced its first death from the disease that has seen more than 4,000 people infected.

China's capital today recorded its first fatality from the coronavirus as it struggles to contain a rapidly spreading disease that has sparked global alarm.

Countries around the wold have been scrambling to evacuate their citizens from the epicentre of the epidemic in Wuhan.

The first case in Germany was confirmed in the southern Bavaria region today as the total death toll in China reached 106.

A spokesman for the Bavarian health ministry said: 'A man in the Starnberg region has been infected with the new coronavirus.'

He is under surveillance in an isolation ward, the ministry added.

The fatality in Beijing raises the death toll from the new virus to 82, with more than 2,700 people infected across the nation.

Cases have been identified in more than a dozen other countries, including the first confirmed patients in Canada, the United States, Australia, Japan and Sri Lanka.

Authorities in China reported 24 deaths in Hubei province, where the virus first was detected in December, and one in Beijing.

The German health ministry gave no further details on how the patient came to be infected but said he was in a 'medically good state'.

France was the first European country to be affected by the outbreak, which has reported three known cases of the virus.

All three had recently travelled to China and have been placed in isolation.

Germany has recommended its citizens avoid 'unnecessary' trips to China as the virus spreads and is also considering the possible evacuation of its nationals from the Chinese city of Wuhan.

Japan also was preparing to fly its citizens out of Wuhan, and Germany was considering evacuating its estimated 90 citizens in Wuhan.

The US urged its citizens to 'reconsider' all travel to China and told them not to go to central Hubei province, where the pneumonia-like virus emerged. Mongolia closed its vast border to vehicles from China.

In a sign of mounting official concern, Premier Li Keqiang visited ground zero to oversee containment efforts in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people where the disease first appeared late last month.

The government has sealed off Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province, effectively trapping tens of millions of people including thousands of foreigners, in a bid to contain the virus as the Lunar New Year holiday unfolds.

China decided to extend the holiday, initially due to end on January 30, for three days to limit population flows and control the epidemic.

US President Donald Trump said the United States has offered Beijing 'any help that is necessary' in combatting the virus.

The health commission in the capital said a 50 year-old-man who visited Wuhan died of respiratory failure on Monday, less than three weeks after visiting the city.

More than 700 new infections were confirmed in the country, while the number of suspected cases nearly doubled over a 24-hour period to more than 4,400.

The National Health Commission said 2,744 cases in mainland China were confirmed by midnight Sunday, but by Monday that figure had rocketed.

Chinese authorities today released first pictures of the new strain of coronavirus.

The National Health Commission said that of the thousands of cases the youngest is a nine-month-old girl in Beijing.

China's health minister, Ma Xiaowei, warned Sunday that the country was entering a 'crucial stage' as 'it seems like the ability of the virus to spread is getting stronger'.

Wuhan is building two hospitals, one with 1,500 beds and another with 1,000, for the growing number of patients. The first is scheduled to be finished next week.

The virus is from the coronavirus family that includes the common cold but also more severe illnesses like SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.

The new virus causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath and pneumonia.

The virus is thought to have spread to people from wild animals sold at a market in Wuhan.

On Sunday, authorities banned trade in wild animals and urged people to stop eating meat from them.
