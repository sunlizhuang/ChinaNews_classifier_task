Many countries have banned the entry of Chinese nationals. Many have even cancelled visa on arrival for tourists amidst coronavirus scare. Thorough checks and examinations of people who have flown from China to any other place in the world are being made so that the situation can be contained.

But one Chinese student may have put the lives of thousands of people in Australia at risk.

Daily Mail reports that a Chinese student snuck into Australia and bragged about how he flouted the coronavirus travel ban.

He lied to immigration officials that he arrived from Hong Kong when he actually travelled to Sydney from mainland China and he boasted about it on texts.

Australian government too passed measures barring passengers who have left or passed through mainland China from entering Australia.

There are already 12 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia. The studentâ€™s name is reportedly Xiao K. He began his journey in China, changed planes in Hong Kong, then arrived in Brisbane.

He revealed that he lied on his yellow incoming passenger card and bragged that he quickly crossed out 'China' as his place of departure and wrote 'Hong Kong' instead.

The passenger claimed that he was not aware of the ban when he first boarded a plane at an unknown Chinese airport.

But then before going through immigration in Australia, he exploited an airport loophole to change his arrival card.

People arriving from China, are required to self-isolate for 14 days after they leave the country, but this student did not do that, potentially putting thousands of people at risk.



The ban came on the same day as three cases of coronavirus were confirmed in Australia, taking the toll to 12.
