Jakarta (ANTARA) - Indonesia's Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita attested to the fact that the coronavirus outbreak had yet to impact the exports of industrial products to China despite concerns of China's economy weakening owing to the pandemic."I think there is no impact yet of the outbreak in spite of concerns that China's economy will weaken significantly due to the virus outbreak. This is something that we have to monitor," Kartasasmita stated here on Tuesday.Chinaâ€™s authority has yet to confirm the incubation period of the virus, though Indonesia will remain vigilant, the minister stated."I think this is something to be observed closely. We have to remain vigilant," he noted.Kartasasmita has also appealed to the Health Ministry to prevent the virus from spreading to the country through the import of raw material and substitutions from China."I will confirm this with Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto, so that they could check all imported products from China," the minister stated.The Wuhan coronavirus has, until now, claimed 106 lives, with almost 2,800 cases confirmed across China, as the country initiates emergency procedures to strive to rein in the pathogen's global spread.The virus has spread quickly around the world since it was first discovered in Wuhan last month.Several countries, including the United States, Australia, France, and Spain are looking to repatriate citizens and government employees from China.
