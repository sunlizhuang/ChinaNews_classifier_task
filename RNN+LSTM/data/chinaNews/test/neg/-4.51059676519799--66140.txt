Genting Malaysia Bhd (Feb 10, RM2.97) Upgrade to trading buy with a target price of RM3.35: Genting Malaysia Bhd’s share price recently took a beating, down 10% due to fears concerning the Wuhan virus outbreak and its impact on earnings. The group has since announced cancellations of all tour bookings from China for February as a precautionary measure to reduce the risk of the virus spreading.

Take note Chinese tourists only accounted about 4% of Resorts World Genting’s (RWG) visitors. Nevertheless, fears of contracting the virus will lead to even locals shunning crowded places such as theme parks and casinos. This is likely to affect Genting Malaysia’s first quarter ending March 31, 2020 (1QFY20). Based on our estimates, in the worst-case scenario, Chinese and Singaporean tourists’ absence at RWG for six months could hurt Genting Malaysia’s financial year ending Dec 31, 2020 (FY20) earnings forecast by about 18%.

However, take note that Genting Malaysia’s outdoor theme park, expected to open by mid-2020, could attract more visitors in the second half of 2020 (2H20). For now, our earnings forecasts are unchanged. By trading at a one-year forward price-earnings ratio (PER) of 12 times, slightly above -1 standard deviation (SD) of 11 times, we reckon this offers a bargain-hunting opportunity.

Hence, our rating is raised from “neutral” to “trading buy”. We forecast a regular FY19 dividend per share of nine sen excluding a potential special dividend, translating into a yield of about 3%.

Last week, the group announced cancellations of all tour bookings from China for February. Traditionally, RWG’s peak period is during the year end and Chinese New Year holidays. Hence, we believe high visitor arrivals would probably have been captured between December 2019 and January 2020 before the virus scare.

Chinese tourists were about 4% of total visitors. Although Chinese tourists are not a major contributor — day-trippers made up of about 75% of total visitors — the overall visitors are expected to be affected, particularly those from Singapore as well, in 1QFY20 as tourists shun crowded places.

Thus far, although the Wuhan virus transmission is faster than previous outbreaks, it remains mostly confined to China with a lower fatality at around 2%. Based on transmission patterns of previous outbreaks, a weak sunlight and colder temperatures in the northern hemisphere may have helped in spreading the virus. However, this may be suppressed as sunshine intensifies with warmer temperatures from May to September. Nevertheless, history may not be an accurate guide as the Wuhan virus is new and could behave differently.

Assuming Chinese and Singaporean tourists stop travelling to RWG for six months, we estimate Genting Malaysia’s FY20 earnings will drop about 18%. Imputing a PER of 11 times (based on -1 SD of a 10-year historical) on Malaysia’s earnings, our sum-of-parts-based valuation will fall to RM2.70. We see this as a potential downside for its share price if the virus outbreak prolongs. — PublicInvest Research, Feb 10
