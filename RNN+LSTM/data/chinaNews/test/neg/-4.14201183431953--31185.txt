CONCORD, NH â€“ Two people in New Hampshire have been isolated after visiting the Chinese city at the center of the Coronavirus outbreak.

A spokeswoman for Littleton Regional Healthcare tells WMUR-TV they are treating one of the two patients.

Littleton Regional Healthcare took to Facebook Monday to confirm they were treating a student from White Mountain School in Bethlehem who traveled to Hunan, China in December, and returned in the beginning of January. The post says the student showed mild flu-like symptoms and per CDC guidelines, they were isolated to prevent cross-contamination to other parts of the hospital.

The patient is still undergoing testing, which LRH says can take 24-48 hours to confirm a diagnosis.

LRH followed up with another post, assuring that there is no threat to other patients or visitors in the hospital.

The students identity has been withheld, and LRH said they will bring updates as they become available. No word yet on the second person.
