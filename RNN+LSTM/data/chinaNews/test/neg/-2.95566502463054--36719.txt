The Chinese tourist, Mr. Jia Jianhua, 60, flew from Wuhan city to Preah Sihanouk coastal province, along with three family members whose specimens were tested negative for 2019-nCoV.

Mr. Jia Jianhua left Wuhan for Sihanoukville on Jan. 23 and his symptoms - fever and runny nose - were developed on Jan. 25. He was tested positive by the Pasteur Institute of Cambodia on Jan. 27.
