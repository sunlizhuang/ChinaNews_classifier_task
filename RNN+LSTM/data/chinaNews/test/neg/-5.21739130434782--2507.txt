New Delhi :

Amid heightened tension between the United States and Iran, China has urged both the countries to exercise restraint and resolve all the disputed via dialogue. The statement comes after Tehran targeted US military bases in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of a senior general."The worsening of the situation in the Middle East region is not in any side's interests," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said during a daily briefing on Wednesday, reiterating a call for a peaceful resolution of the conflict.

Earlier, Iran launched over a dozen ballistic missiles targeting at least two bases where US military and coalition forces' are stationed in Iraq, which Tehran said was a "slap in the face" of America.

According to Iranian state TV, the attacks were in revenge for the killing of the commander of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards, General Qasem Soleimani, in a US drone strike on Friday, which was ordered by President Donald Trump.

While the Iranian state television claimed that "at least 80 terrorist US soldiers" were killed in the strikes, the Pentagon said it is working on initial battle damage assessments. Some 5,000 US soldiers are in Iraq as part of the international coalition against the IS terror group.

The Iraqi military in a statement said a total of 22 missiles hit two bases housing US troops, but there were no victims among the Iraqi forces.

Shortly after the missile attacks, Trump tweeted, "All is well! Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq. Assessment of casualties & damages taking place now. So far, so good! We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world, by far! I will be making a statement tomorrow morning."

Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the attacks were a "slap in the face" of the US.

In a speech broadcast live on state television, Khamenei said, "Last night, a slap in the face was delivered." US officials said President Trump has been briefed and he is monitoring the situation.
