Health chiefs sounded the alarm today over the “very fast” spread of killer coronavirus as British diplomats were locked in talks with the Chinese authorities to permit UK nationals and their families to fly home from the city at the centre of the crisis.

With the official death toll from the virus hitting 170, and the number of those infected 7,711, the World Health Organisation’s emergency committee was reconvening today to decide whether the virus should be declared a global emergency.

About 200 Britons in Wuhan, where the outbreak started, were waiting for a repatriation flight to be allowed by the Chinese authorities. Officials are believed to have been refusing to allow non-British citizens on board, which would mean families being split up.

Some of the stranded British citizens have been told that the British government-chartered plane, which is thought to now not be in Britain, could be in Wuhan for a departure early tomorrow morning local time.

The FTSE 100 and other European and Asian stock markets fell as it was confirmed that the virus has now reached every region of China, where the vast bulk of cases have been reported.

Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, told Sky News: “This is a very worrying situation now — it looks like this virus has spread very fast.

“It looks like it has spread pretty widely, it may be very hard to contain. We have to do everything we can to slow this one down.”

With evidence suggesting it is taking off “much more sharply” than the 2002/03 Sars outbreak, Professor Openshaw stressed the big concern was how it would spread in less developed parts of the world, including highly-populated areas, where there is little medical care.

Dr Michael Ryan, executive director at the WHO health emergencies programme, said the decision to reconvene was due to the increasing number of cases and evidence of person-to-person transmission of the virus.

“The whole world needs to be on alert now, the whole world needs to take action and be ready for any cases that come, either from the original epicentre or from other epicentres that become established.”

Ministers are also understood to be concerned at the pace of coronavirus spreading, though it is not thought to be as deadly as Sars.

Scientists believe the infection is likely to arrive in the UK and an analysis of international air travel suggested London is the European city most at risk of an outbreak.

Countries were scrambling to repatriate their citizens from Wuhan.

The British flight had been expected to take off early today but there were delays in getting the necessary permits from the Chinese authorities.

Minister Nick Gibb told Sky News: “There are some difficult issues that are being negotiated at very senior levels between the British Government and the Chinese government.

“Our priority is to ensure the safety and welfare of British nationals in Wuhan and ensure they do return to the UK as soon as possible.”

Japan and America have succeeded in airlifting hundreds of nationals out of Wuhan but other countries are believed to be facing similar problems to the UK.

Tom Tugendhat, the newly re-elected chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said: “I hope British people in China will be able to follow [Foreign Office] travel advice without difficulty and families will be able to stay together.”

Anthony May-Smith, one of those waiting to be evacuated, told Sky News he now expects the flights to take off tomorrow. British citizens had been told to make their way to a meeting point some three kilometres from the airport, he added, and they would then be taken there by bus.

The British plane, which will have three military medics on board, is expected to fly directly to a military base, possibly RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, with the evacuees then to be taken to an NHS facility to be quarantined for two weeks.

Infections have been reported in at least 16 other countries, including France and Germany, with 105 confirmed cases, but no deaths have occurred outside China.

The number of cases has jumped to 7,711, surpassing the 5,327 people diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) during the 2002/03 outbreak.

The death toll of 170 is currently lower than the 348 people who died in China from Sars.
