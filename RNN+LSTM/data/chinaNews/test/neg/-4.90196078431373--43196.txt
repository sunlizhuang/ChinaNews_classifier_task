Eight male students have been isolated from other boarders at John Paul College south of Brisbane over coronavirus concerns.

They will be withdrawn from the school, in the Logan suburb of Daisy Hill, for 14 days following their return to Australia from China or Hong Kong.

The Novel Coronavirus virus was identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China.

The move followed recent Queensland Health advice that students, teachers or other staff at risk of having contracted coronavirus shouldn’t go to school, as a precaution.

John Paul College principal Karen Spiller OAM said students were being supported while withdrawn from school as per the Queensland government’s advice to schools and universities.
