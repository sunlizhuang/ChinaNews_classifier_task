Causing severe lung diseases such as pneumonia, the Coronavirus normally begins with symptoms such as a dry cough and fever, followed by shortness of breath. At the time of writing, the number of confirmed cases is nearing 3,000, with over 100 dead.

The virus is thought to originate from illegal wildlife trading at the Huanan Seafood Market in the Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei province. The virus broke out in late December 2019, and drastic measures have been taken to contain the virus by the Chinese government. Transport out of Hubei has been locked down, and returning residents are prohibited to leave.

This has been amplified because of the timing of the outbreak, with Lunar New Year being a time when millions of Chinese residents travel in and out of China, and across the world to celebrate with friends and family.

One of those is the Kang family, who has been in Wuhan for the past nine months. They left home on 22nd January for a Chinese New Year vacation to Lamma Island in Hong Kong—a place they used to call home.





Connie, 28, is from Hubei province, and is a Director of a local Kindergarten. Her husband Emmanuel, 42, is from Geneva, Switzerland, and is a stay-at-home father. They have two young children: Nikola, 8, and Nikita, 8-months-old.

Both sat down with me to discuss their experience as the Coronavirus crisis accelerates.

“The first case of the virus was found on the 31st December and very quickly, one or two days after we were told they had identified where. A market that sold wildlife—bats, foxes, and rats—was the reason”, Connie told me.

How do you think the Chinese government has handled the outbreak?

“The Xi government has said it’s ‘strictly forbidden’ to hide any information from the public. There have been news apps that have been updating every few hours, telling us how many are affect[ed] and have died”, Connie stated.

“Most companies in some ways are linked to the government, so information will be passed down to staff and employees”, Emmanuel added.

I was curious about their thoughts on the precautions needed for living in Wuhan, since the outbreak. At the time I interviewed them, neither were wearing masks nor seemed concerned about getting sick or transmitting to others.

“For me, I stay home. You can always order things online, like food and vegetables”, Emmanuel said.
