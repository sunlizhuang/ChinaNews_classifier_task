The Morrison Government really doesn’t want to cut its China lifeline. You can feel in the water, in the burning air, in every contradictory statement by its floundering MPs, in the selling out of workers at the airport, via Bloomie:

The union representing security workers at Australia’s biggest airports threatened to strike unless members are given equipment to guard against the new coronavirus. Some airport staff have been barred from wearing protective gear such as face masks to avoid upsetting customers, the United Workers Union said in a statement Friday. The union represents 150,000 workers in Australia from more than 45 industries. “If the health and safety needs of these workers are not met, United Workers Union will direct members to cease work even if it means grounding every flight in the country,” Damien Davie, the union’s spokesman for property services, said in the statement.

We can’t cut the lifeline. No matter the lives lost. The ponzi must go on.

In recent hours, Virgin Atlantic and Air Canada have suspended flights to China and Japan has warned its citizens to stay away.

And what is Scomo doing? As usual. Nothing but blather.
