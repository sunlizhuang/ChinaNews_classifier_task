A KILLER has been jailed after a pub attack was filmed by a witness wearing "spy cam glasses" with an integrated camera in what is thought to be a legal first.

James Collinson, 38, from Bridlington, punched 59-year-old John Glenn twice in a pub in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, on September 1 last year.

He then punched the victim again as he was leaving the pub. The punch knocked Mr Glenn unconscious.

Mr Glenn died nearly a month later.

In what is believed to be a legal first, footage from the pair of £7 glasses was used by prosecutors to build a case against Leeds United fan Collinson.

Collinson was jailed at Leeds Crown Court on Valentine's Day after pleading guilty to manslaughter and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.



PUB ATTACK

The attack, on September 1 last year in the Golden Last pub, was seen by a witness wearing "spy cam glasses" he'd bought on eBay.

He later spoke to police, who downloaded the footage.

The witness, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "I was wearing my glasses with a video camera, microphone and SD cards. Next thing, it kicked off, so I clicked 'record' and just filmed it.

"I can film anything I like in a public place just like anyone can on their mobile phone.

"I bought them for £7 off eBay. I typed in 'spy cam glasses' and got them from China."

The devices can record up to five hours of footage.

David Gordon, prosecuting, told the court Mr Glenn had been in an argument with another man before he was attacked by Collinson.

Ambulance crews attempted to resuscitate Mr Glenn before he was taken to Scarborough District Hospital. Mr Glenn was then placed into a medically induced coma.

He did not respond to treatment and died on September 27.

His daughter, Kelly Murphy, described her beloved dad as her "best friend".

Ms Murphy, who never left her father’s side during his four-week fight for life, told the Scarborough News: "It was as if my whole world had stopped.

"My heart has been properly broken and I don’t think it will ever be fixed."

Collinson, a married dad-of-two, had a track record of drink-related violence and a string of previous convictions.

Investigating Officer, North Yorkshire Police's Detective Inspector Jonathan Sygrove, said: "Collinson has a long history of violence and assault and his sentence clearly reflects the seriousness of his most recent offence which resulted in the tragic loss of a man's life.

"His actions have caused a huge amount of pain for John Glenn's family and this is something they will have to deal with for the rest of their lives."
