CLEVELAND, Ohio – Director Steven Soderbergh has the coronavirus outbreak to thank for the surge in popularity of his 2011 film “Contagion.” The movie starring Matt Damon, Marion Cotillard and Gwyneth Paltrow has moved into the top 10 on iTunes as people are starting to believe it was about nine years ahead of its time.

The plot focuses on a mysterious virus that kills more than 25 million people around the world, baffling the Centers for Disease Control. Spoiler Alert: Paltrow’s character winds up being patient zero after contracting the virus from a chef in Honk Kong who handled a slaughtered pig that had been infected by a bat.

Why does this have people freaking out over the coronavirus? Well, the virus, which presents with flu-like symptoms, showed up first in China, possibly originating at a seafood market that sold rats, wolves and other wildlife for human consumption.

On Tuesday, two Miami University students who traveled to China were being tested for the coronavirus. The CDC calls the virus an “emerging, rapidly evolving situation.”

Though the risk of getting the virus is extremely low, the CDC had confirmed five cases of coronavirus in this country, with 110 potential cases under investigation throughout the U.S.
