LAS CRUCES, New Mexico — New Mexico State University says its study abroad office will not be sending students to China amid a new virus that has sickened thousands and killed hundreds.

University spokeswoman Minerva Baumann told The Associated Press this week that the school would follow the U.S. State Department’s “Do Not Travel" warning about China until further notice.

NMSU's decision came shortly before Delta, American and United airlines all announced they would suspend their mainland China flights in response to the coronavirus outbreak and the State Department warning.

Baumann said New Mexico State didn't have any outbound students registered through Study Abroad who were planning to study in China this semester.

The virus has sickened nearly 10,000 people in China, and more than 200 people have died. Symptoms include fever, cough, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath or pneumonia.
