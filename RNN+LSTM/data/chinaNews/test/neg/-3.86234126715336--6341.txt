When he asked the immigration officer whether the decision was being made in Beijing or Hong Kong, she insisted it was being made in Hong Kong, Roth said.

Roth has visited Hong Kong numerous times and this is the first time he has been denied entry, he said. The last time he visited the city was in April 2018 to hold a press conference about Human Rights Watch's report on gender discrimination in the Chinese job market.

"All that was uneventful, as had been my prior trips to Hong Kong," he recalled. "It's a sad testament to the deterioration in basic freedoms in Hong Kong that I would be barred less than two years later."

Mass demonstrations - underpinned by a distrust of China's ruling Communist Party - began in Hong Kong in June, with protesters rallying against an extradition bill that was later withdrawn. The movement has since expanded to include demands for electoral reform and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality.

A former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997. Under the framework of "one country, two systems," the territory was promised greater democratic rights than are afforded to the mainland. But protesters say their liberties have been steadily eroding under Chinese President Xi Jinping.
