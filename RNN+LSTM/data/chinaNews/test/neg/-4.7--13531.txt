Homes toppled, their occupants discarded without a second thought - thank goodness those days are gone. Evictions were a feature of Irish life under British rule in the 19th century but the past is a foreign country, they do things differently there.

Or do they? Evictions are back with a vengeance in the 21st century, with rough sleepers and their temporary shelters being swept away as eyesores. If people can't see the problem, it doesn't exist, right? So much for almost 100 years of self-government.

A general election campaign to vote in the 33rd Dáil started officially this week and the standout image is the profoundly unrepublican treatment of a homeless man - his spine crushed by industrial machinery as State-backed powers set about demolishing his home.

This man's back wasn't broken by accident. It didn't happen as a result of some unfortunate sequence of events over which no one had control. He was injured because a clean-up was ordered along Dublin's canals where homeless people had pitched tents, and because inadequate checks were made to ensure those tents were empty.

Why was this unfortunate man sleeping under canvas in mid-January in the first place? Because of the outgoing Government's chronic inability to tackle the interrelated housing and homeless crises.

Something is ugly. Irredeemably, disfiguringly ugly. It's the policies which contribute to our homeless epidemic - not the supposed unsightliness of tents used to shelter human beings from the elements.

The usual verbiage about investigations and reports has been advanced and at least four inquiries are under way. But here's what we know already.

Waterways Ireland was intent on removing homeless people's tents from the Leeson Street area of the Grand Canal, brought in machinery to do it - and a man in his thirties has suffered appalling injuries.

Eviction notices were served the previous day. Legislative powers were on Waterways Ireland's side, of course. But there is a higher law and that's the law of common humanity.

Arriving with machinery to dispose of someone's shelter, however temporary, is a dehumanising exercise. Forcibly eliminating another person's home shows a lack of respect towards the individual.

A vehicle with a mechanical claw on the end of a metal arm was used. Was it really necessary to use machinery?

Why not just put on protective clothing and dismantle the tent, if it really had to be taken down?

The incident happened at lunchtime on Tuesday in broad daylight when it seems the tent was prodded but no one took the basic precaution of checking inside. Occupancy was only established when movement from inside the tent was noticed after it was lifted into the air.

This incident dishonours us all. The Taoiseach has said everyone "feels shame" at the homeless crisis. But not everyone is in a position to take direct action to effect change. He is.

According to the Central Bank, the economy grew by a healthy 8.2pc in 2018 and figures are expected to show it expanded by 5pc last year. But the rising tide isn't lifting all boats. As volunteer group the Homeless Street Café can testify.

It has posted online a photograph of an elderly woman eating her dinner on a Dublin street, using a windowsill as her table. Every week, her evening meal is taken outdoors.

The volunteer who put up the picture described it as heart-breaking that her "golden years" are being spent in such circumstances, added: "To be living in food or heat poverty at their age, relying on a soup kitchen for necessities, is horrifying to witness."

The Homeless Street Café charity, which sets up tables and feeds hot meals to homeless people on Tuesday nights on Grafton Street, also distributes clothes and toiletries. One of its posts refer to the work as "nothing but a plaster or a band-aid on what is just a horrific wound".

Three months ago, it circulated a photograph of a five-year-old boy eating his dinner from a sheet of cardboard on the pavement. At the same time, figures showed more than 10,000 people, including 4,000 children, were homeless. Everyone agreed this was a national shame. But the shame continues.

And now a man has a broken back as a result of policies which treat human beings as disposable.

Waterways Ireland said it had been working "in co-operation with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive to remove tents along the canals in Dublin where they have become a public safety hazard".

There have been problems with discarded needles and human faeces near tents by the canal, and this does impact on public safety.

But it's odd to be concerned about public safety in the abstract and take less care about it in individual cases.

Dublin City Council said every action by State services "is taken in the interest of health and safety of those individuals experiencing homelessness". Tell that to the man whose spine was crushed.

The fact that this unfortunate person appears to have been asleep, and unaware of what was happening, indicates he may have felt it safer to take his rest in daylight rather than after dark.

Some homeless people prefer to take their chances in doorways and tents rather than enter emergency accommodation. In return for shelter in hostels, they are expected to share rooms with strangers. They fear violence or robbery - with just cause.

And another thing. Even if the Grand Canal tent inhabitant had been absent during the clean-up, he would have returned to find his home dumped, along with anything it contained. Other homeless people must have had similar experiences.

There has been a certain amount of attempted victim-blaming from some quarters. It's beside the point to say the man had declined to go into a hostel, or that fair warning of the intended clean-up operation was given. Rough sleepers have a complex range of problems and it really doesn't look as if this was considered sufficiently when the so-called tidy-up got under way.

Homeless services need to be brought under the umbrella of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), guaranteeing regular inspections.

Meanwhile, it cannot be said too loudly or too often - social and affordable housing must be built as a matter of priority.

That's the issue on which voters ought to cast their preferences in the General Election.

Politicians who recognise our ongoing state of emergency and can commit credibly to delivering change - those are the ones we need in the 33rd Dáil.

It's inhumane to carry on as we are. Where's the point in a thriving economy if the money generated isn't used to look after our people in need?
