Dr Young said they had only done general tests for coronavirus, because they were yet to receive the updated “primers” with the details of the specific virus from the World Health Organisation. However, she said they expected to receive them shortly and they would then be distributed to all GPs and emergency departments around the state.

“So the advice is that anyone who travels to Wuhan and comes back and is unwell, for them to go and see their GP or emergency department, and to isolate themself." She said they were not currently screening for the disease at Brisbane International Airport, because there were no flights directly from the area around Wuhan to Brisbane.

Dr Young, along with other state and territory medical officers met with the nation’s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy on Monday evening to discuss the response to the disease.

At a press conference earlier on Tuesday Professor Murphy did not mention the man being monitored in Brisbane, but stressed there were no confirmed cases of the virus in Australia. "No international travellers have yet been confirmed as having this coronavirus in Australia and we already have well-established existing biosecurity measures at the border," he said. Loading Four people have died in China after contracting the virus, which appears to have been spread by animals at livestock markets before jumping to humans. There have been 222 confirmed cases of the virus so far, mostly in China but also in Japan and Thailand, since it was first detected in December.

The new disease is not influenza but is the same type of virus as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-2003 outbreak, which also started in China. However international health authorities are urging calm, saying with the right precautions the current outbreak will not become as deadly.
