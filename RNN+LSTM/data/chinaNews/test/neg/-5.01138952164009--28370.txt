A spokesperson for US Forces in Afghanistan has confirmed that an American military plane crashed in Afghanistan's Ghazni province, south of the capital.

An investigation was underway to determine what caused the military aircraft to crash in Ghazni province Monday, Col. Sonny Leggett said, claiming that there is "no indication" the plane was downed by enemy fire.

"A U.S. Bombardier E-11A crashed today in Ghazni province, Afghanistan. While the cause of crash is under investigation, there are no indications the crash was caused by enemy fire. We will provide additional information as it becomes available," he said in a tweet.

"Taliban claims that additional aircraft have crashed are false," he added.

The Taliban earlier said they shot down the plane carrying US military personnel, adding that everyone on board was killed, including high-ranking officials.

It was not immediately clear how many people were on board the plane. Ariana Afghan Airlines denied reports that it was one of its passenger jets that had come down.

Photos and video from the scene showed what appeared to be a U.S. E-11A military aircraft and what looked like a US military insignia on the plane, according to images of the site analyzed by NBC News.

According to videos posted online, the plane was probably the US Air Force E-11A aircraft assigned to 430th Expeditionary Electronic Combat Squadron.

E-11A is the military variant of the civil Bombardier BD-700 Global Express for use as overhead communications-relay platform in southwest Asia.

According an unverified report the officers killed in the crash belonged to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

The cause of the crash remains unclear, and no details about casualties have been given.

"An aircraft of American occupiers has crashed in Ghazni province," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a Pashto-language statement, adding that all the crewmembers on board have been killed, AFP reported.
