A Chinese man has been fined VND40 million (US$1,727) for driving a car without a license and under the influence of alcohol in Vietnam.

Police pulled over a car for an administrative check in Lang Chanh District, Thanh Hoa Province, located in north-central Vietnam, earlier this month, Senior Lieutenent Colonel Nguyen Quang Thuy, chief of the district’s police, told Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper on Thursday.

They found that the driver Zheng Lianxian, a 49-year-old Chinese citizen, was drunk and did not have any driver’s license.

Police officers booked the case and temporarily confiscated the car, reporting it to higher levels for handling.

The chairman of the Thanh Hoa People’s Committee then issued a decision to fine Zheng VND35 million ($1,511) for drunk driving and VND5 million ($216) for driving without a driver’s license.

Police in Vietnam have cracked down on drunk driving since a new law took effect on January 1.

The law strictly bans drivers from drinking any amount of alcoholic beverages.

Cyclists shall be subject to a VND400,000-600,000 ($17.3-26) fine when they are found riding after drinking alcoholic beverages.

Car drivers will be fined VND30-40 million ($1,297-1,729) and have their driving license revoked for 22-24 months if they break regulations on drink-driving.

Motorcyclists will face a VND6-8 million ($259-346) and have their driving license revoked for 22-24 months for the same offense.
