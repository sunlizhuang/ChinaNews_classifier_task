The Gulf kingdom says it has banned citizens and expatriates from traveling to China amid coronavirus outbreak

Saudi Arabia will stop expatriates from returning to the kingdom if they travel to China in an effort to contain the outbreak of coronavirus.

The kingdom banned citizens and expatriates from traveling to China, state-run Saudi Press Agency reported. Saudi citizens violating the restrictions would be penalized, while expatriates wouldn’t be allowed back into the country.

Saudi Arabia is home to more than 13 million expatriates. The kingdom hasn’t reported any cases of coronavirus so far.

China's coronavirus crisis has deepened with the death toll soaring to 563 on Thursday, as thousands of people trapped on quarantined cruise ships add to the global panic about the epidemic.

More than 28,000 people have now been infected across China as authorities struggle to contain the outbreak despite compelling millions to stay indoors in a growing number of cities.

Two dozen countries have confirmed cases of the respiratory disease which emerged from a market selling exotic animals in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.

Saudi Arabia is not among them, although the neighbouring United Arab Emirates has reported five confirmed cases, all among Chinese arrivals from Wuhan.

Elsewhere in the Gulf, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman have advised their citizens against all travel to China but without any compulsion.

Tighter travel restrictions including quarantines are spreading as worldwide efforts to contain the coronavirus accelerate.

Here are places with known major constraints on travelers or China travel:

Foreign nationals in mainland China will not be allowed to enter Australia until 14 days after they have left or transited through China, the government said.

The government has advised against any travel to mainland China.
