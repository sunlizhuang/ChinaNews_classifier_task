The coronavirus epidemic has killed at least 82 people - all in China - and sickened more than 2,890.

The health crisis has led the authorities to quarantine at least 56 million people living in central China's Hubei Province and cancel Lunar New Year festivities around the country.

Following the outbreak, scientists fear more than 100,000 people may have been infected already, considerably more than official toll â€“ others have said it could as high as 350,000.

In a sign of the mounting official concern, China's Premier Li Keqiang visited ground zero today to oversee containment efforts in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people where the disease first appeared late last month.

One of the widely circulated clip purports to show corpses of coronavirus victims left unattended in a corridor of a hospital flooded with patients in Wuhan.

The footage was uploaded by a web user, known as 'magic girl Xiao Xi', who claimed to be a nurse in the city.

A woman, believed to be the blogger, can be heard saying from behind the camera: 'Three corpses, [they] have been lying here all morning. Some of them died in the wee hours. Nobody has come to deal with [them] yet.

'And doctors, nurses and patients, they all work in such an environment. This is what is going on in a designated hospital. Not a single person is here to manage.'

The Chinese authorities declared the video inauthentic.
