Cathay Pacific is under renewed pressure from its staff to suspend flights to mainland China following action by the United States, Australia and Singapore to restrict foreigners who had been to the country.

The fresh call to halt the routes amid fears surrounding the coronavirus threat came as sister airline Cathay Dragon announced on Saturday it would be suspending flights to the mainland cities of Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Sanya and Haikou on February 2 and 3.

Australia’s national carrier and Qatar Airways on Saturday said their decision to suspend China flights was down to new entry restrictions, with Qantas citing Friday measures by Singapore and the US it said would affect “crew who work across the Qantas International network”.

Cathay’s cabin crew has warned they would strike unless Cathay Pacific Group stopped operating all flights to the mainland.

During the past week, most major airlines – including all North American carriers that fly into mainland China – have suspended flights there until at least the end of February.

Delta Air Lines will not resume flights until May.

Qantas said its aircrew would be unable to work on any of its nine flights to the US or seven to Singapore scheduled for Saturday, if they had previously worked on a mainland China route.

For Cathay Pacific, with eight flights to Singapore, 14 to the US and 10 to Australia scheduled on Saturday, it was a similar scenario.

Hong Kong’s flagship carrier operates three flights daily to each of Beijing and Shanghai, while Cathay Dragon, which operates with separate pilots and cabin crew, typically runs almost 50 flights a day to mainland China.

While Cathay Pacific can stop flying to mainland China to avoid crew problems across the rest of its international network, Cathay Dragon can continue as normal since it does not fly to Singapore, the US or Australia.

Responding to staff members’ concerns regarding mainland flights on Saturday, the airline said: “We are aware of the crew’s concerns. We have been and will continue to communicate closely with our crew.”

Meanwhile, Cathay Pacific’s cabin crew union said the airline was considering rolling out more protective measures on every flight, following pleas from flight attendants.

Since Thursday, passengers on mainland China flights have not been receiving pillows, blankets, hot towels, or magazines. The cabin crew serve a simplified meal service and have stopped serving drinks for everyone except business class in a bid to limit the risk of on-board infection.

Flight Attendants’ Union (FAU) chiefs also want bread rolls ditched along with any other food that is not properly sealed and covered.

Other hoped-for measures would include allowing crews to collect trash with plastic bags throughout the flight, rather than using a trolley cart, and removing liquid waste disposal jugs.

“The company agreed to consider these suggestions,” the FAU told its members on Facebook on Friday night, assuring them they “totally understand the concerns and worries among crew community towards the rapidly evolving situation of the coronavirus.

“As the union representative of the cabin crew community, your [executive committee] believes that the major responsibility of ensuring a safe working environment lies on the company. We will continue to monitor the situation and urge the management team to take the necessary action.”

Rebecca Sy On-na, chairwoman of the Dragon Airlines Flight Attendants Association, said unionised cabin crew for Cathay Dragon would vote on February 8 on whether to take strike action, adding that membership was angry the vote was still so far away.

Six cabin crew from four Cathay Dragon flights – three from Wuhan and one from Haikou – have been isolated either at government-designated camps or self-quarantined at home in recent weeks, according to the union.

“The crew go to work in horror every day, because they don’t know if they will be the next one to be isolated,” Sy said.

Cathay Pacific is waiving fees for people who rebook or re-route flights to, from or through Hong Kong, the airline announced on its website on Saturday.

In relaxing its travel policies, the airline said it would not waive charges for those wanting to cancel their tickets outright.
