Matt Hancock insisted the Government would 'not hesitate' to increase measures to protect the UK from the spread of the deadly Chinese coronavirus today amid fears that safety checks at airports were not tough enough.

The Health Secretary sought to reassure the public today as he addressed MPs about the killer outbreak that has led Beijing to place a city larger than London in quarantine.

Passengers landing at Heathrow Airport from Wuhan - centre of the deadly outbreak - described an easy arrival through the airport as fears grow over the disease.

Holiday-makers arriving from the virus-hit city expressed their shock as they were met by a health team and given a warning leaflet before they were let directly though the airport after baggage reclaim and immigration checks.

Shadow health minister Sharon Hodgson cited the case saying arrivals seemed to be getting 'virtually no screening' and asked if flights from other Chinese cities would be monitored.

Mr Hancock said: 'Currently the evidence suggests the vast majority of cases are in Wuhan.

'Obviously we keep that under constant review and we will not hesitate to take further steps if that's necessary to protect the British public.'

Chinese authorities are quarantining Wuhan - which has a population of 11 million - cracking down on anyone leaving the city except in the case of special circumstances.

The coronavirus has now killed 17 people and health experts warn the outbreak may already be in Britain. The UK Foreign Office advised against 'all but essential travel' to the Chinese city.

Public Health England said that 'enhanced monitoring' - including a Port Health team who will meet each direct flight aircraft - would be in place for Wuhan arrivals from January 22.

Mr Hancock told MPs cases of the virus have also been reported in Thailand, Japan, South Korea and the US.

He said 'most people' affected have experienced cold and flu symptoms, though some cases have proved fatal.

'We have been closely monitoring the situation in Wuhan and have put in place proportionate, precautionary measures,' he said.

But passengers, who were handed an advice leaflet advising them to contact health professionals if they display symptoms, described an otherwise regular arrival through baggage reclaim and customs.

Eileen, 21, said: 'We came off the plane like any other time. I was in my home of Wuhan just for a month before coming back to study media. Over that month I did not l leave the house, we stayed inside because of the virus. I think more should have been done because the fear of the virus in China is much worse than it is here'

One passenger explained how her home city had shut off all public transport because of the growing fears of the killer disease.

Ni Yu, 24, said: 'Today Wuhan stopped all public transport, trains, aeroplanes and buses. We were allowed to fly because it was before the deadline. I am worried about it.

'When we landed we weren't segregated. It took us two hours to get from the plane to arrivals because of immigration, they had to check our passports.

'All we were given was the mask and the check of our temperature. We were told to ring the NHS 111 if we start feeling ill and that's it.'

Eileen, 21, had been visiting her home of Wuhan for a month before returning to the UK to study media. She said: 'We came off the plane like any other time.

'I think more should have been done because the fear of the virus in China is much worse than it is here.'

She added that over the month she spent in Wuhan she did not l leave the house, staying inside because of the virus.

He said: 'The flight today was pretty much the same as I had on the way to Wuhan except a lot more people had masks, including English people.

'We got our temperature checked at the Chinese airport and they gave us a leaflet from Public Health England when we landed.

'We were told to wait for instructions from immigration controls but when we got off everything was normal, I think the area where we got off might have been more isolated because normally there are toilets straight away but that was it.

'My brother was teaching English in China so I went to visit him. I was there for 12 days but I was in Wuhan for about a week. I had heard rumours before I set off but I had already booked all my flights and I didn't know how serious it was.

'It all started kicking off just before we left. Lots of Chinese people were leaving.'

Thomas Crosby, 31, added: 'There was an exodus in Wuhan but you wouldn't know if that was for Chinese New Year or because of the virus.'

A 25-year-old student who was picking up his mother said: 'I worry abut the virus in Britain. There is news that tomorrow Wuhan will not allow anybody to leave because of the illness.'

Leading scientists have also today warned up to 10,000 patients may have caught the SARS-like virus in Wuhan - more than double the previous estimate. Wuhan officials have today ordered all residents to wear face masks in public places.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) today provided an update saying they need to know more about the outbreak before declaring an international emergency.

An update from Public Health England today said: 'There are 3 direct flights a week that arrive at Heathrow from Wuhan. The enhanced monitoring of direct flights will be kept under continuous review and expanded to other Chinese departure points if necessary.

'Leaflets and information will be made available across all UK airports, advising travellers from China on what do to if they feel unwell.

'Based on the emerging evidence regarding case numbers, potential sources and human to human transmission, the risk to travellers to Wuhan is moderate.

'The risk to the UK population has been assessed as low. This has been raised from very low due to current evidence on the likelihood of cases being imported into this country.

'The UK is well prepared for new diseases and our approach is being kept under constant review.

'In line with our robust preparedness activities for emerging infections, we have issued clinical guidance for the detection and diagnosis of Wuhan Novel Coronavirus and PHE has developed a diagnostic test.

'Thanks to PHE, the UK is now one of the first countries outside China to have a prototype specific laboratory test for this novel disease.

'There are currently no confirmed cases of this new infection in the UK.'
