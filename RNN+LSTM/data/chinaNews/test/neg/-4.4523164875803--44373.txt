Coronavirus travel restrictions block arrivals from China, as Government warns visas could be cancelled

Updated

Thousands of passengers scheduled to fly to Australia overnight were unable to travel, as tough new restrictions on arrivals from China took effect.

Key points: Officials reported a downward trend in arrivals from China after the restrictions were put in place on Saturday

Travellers from China have been warned not to attempt to travel to Australia, unless exempted from the restrictions

Seventy-one people were denied entry to planes flying to Australia overnight

The restrictions, recommended by Australia's chief medical officers in response to the coronavirus outbreak, deny entry to Australia for people who have left or transited through mainland China from February 1.

Exceptions are being made for Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate families, as well as air crews who have been using appropriate personal protective equipment.

The Government announced anyone who has arrived after the restrictions came into place would have their visa cancelled and put "in an alternative place of detention for a quarantine period".

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has also advised Australians not to travel to China due to the "escalating threat" of the virus, while asking those who have returned from the country to self-isolate for 14 days.

Australian Border Force Commissioner Michael Outram told a press conference on Sunday morning that the direction given to airlines had "taken immediate effect as we intended", with a downward trend in the number of passengers arriving from China, and 12 flights being cancelled.

"We are seeing, since the implementation of this measure already, significant impact, a beneficial impact," he said.

"For example, in Melbourne, we were expecting about 5,000 scheduled passengers to arrive from China, and we're now expecting about 700 over that 24-hour period. So a significant downturn.

"In Brisbane, we were expecting 220, and we're now only expecting about 97."

He warned travellers from China not to attempt to enter to Australia until the measures are lifted, unless they are an Australian citizen, a permanent resident or an immediate family member.

He said 71 people in China were denied entry to flights to Australia overnight as a result of the restrictions, and their visas were cancelled.

Christmas Island evacuation to start within 24 hours

Minister Greg Hunt told the press conference that the Australian medical assistance team, with the mobile hospital, has arrived in Christmas Island and they were in place to receive Australians to be evacuated from Wuhan.

He said a flight is expected to be collecting the Australian evacuees within the next day.

"At this stage, we are not expecting people to be ill there, but they are fully prepared," he said.

The Federal Government now says evacuees will not be charged for being flown back from China, despite Australians caught in the epicentre of the outbreak originally being told it would cost them $1,000 if they agreed to an "assisted departure".

On Saturday, South Australia confirmed its first two cases of coronavirus and Victoria its fourth, bringing the national total to 12.

US issues travel ban

The United States declared a public health emergency on Friday and President Donald Trump signed an order barring entry to foreign nationals, other than immediate family of American citizens and permanent residents, who visited China within the last 14 days.

Americans will be allowed to return to the country, but will face screening and are required to undertake 14 days of self-screening. Those returning from Hubei province will be subject to a 14-day quarantine.

Beijing criticised the action taken by Washington, while the WHO warned against heavy-handed responses.

"Just as the WHO recommended against travel restrictions, the US rushed to go in the opposite way. Certainly not a gesture of goodwill," said foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying.

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva that despite the emergency declaration, there is "no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade".

Delta and American Airlines suspended all flights between the United States and China. Other carriers including British Airways, Finnair and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific also have cancelled or cut back service to mainland China. Vietnam suspended all flights to China.

The US order followed a travel advisory for Americans to consider leaving China.

Japan and Germany also advised against non-essential travel and Britain did as well, except for Hong Kong and Macao.

China criticised the US controls, which it said contradicted the WHO's appeal to avoid travel bans, and "unfriendly comments" that Beijing was failing to cooperate.

Prepare for 'domestic outbreak control'

Meanwhile, an official from the WHO has warned governments they need to prepare for "domestic outbreak control" as China's death toll from the virus rose to 304.

South Korea and India has flown hundreds of their citizens out of Wuhan, the city at the centre of an area where some 50 million people are prevented from leaving in a sweeping anti-virus effort.

The evacuees went into a two-week quarantine.

Indonesia also sent a plane, sparking rowdy protests from residents living near a military base that will house evacuees.

The number of confirmed cases in China rose to 14,326, surpassing the number in the 2002-03 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

Both the new virus and SARS are from the coronavirus family, which also includes those that cause the common cold.

The virus's rapid spread in two months prompted WHO on Thursday to declare it a global emergency.

That declaration "flipped the switch" from a cautious attitude earlier to recommending governments prepare for the possibility the virus might spread, said the WHO representative in Beijing, Gauden Galea.

Most cases reported so far have been people who visited China or their family members.

WHO said it was especially concerned that some cases abroad involved human-to-human transmission.

"Countries need to get ready for possible importation in order to identify cases as early as possible and in order to be ready for a domestic outbreak control, if that happens," Mr Galea said.

Calls to stop discrimination of Chinese community

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is calling for people not to discriminate against the Chinese community in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

Her statement follows numerous reports of bullying and harassment towards members of the Asian community, including in schools.

Ms Palaszczuk met with members of the Chinese community in Sunnybank in Brisbane's south on Saturday and said people have no need to be concerned.

"It is very important that people do not discriminate against our Chinese community. They are so involved, they contribute so much to our community and all of the families are absolutely doing the right thing, especially families that are returning from China," she said.
