Coronavirus spread sees Singapore, US, Solomon Islands impose strict travel regulations as case numbers surpass SARS outbreak

Updated

Singapore has banned entry to all Chinese passport holders and foreigners with a recent history of travel to China in one of the most drastic moves yet to combat the spread of the coronavirus.

Key points: Singapore has reported 13 of the more than 10,000 coronavirus cases reported globally

Solomon Islands has restricted entry of any person who has travelled to countries that have confirmed cases of coronavirus

Delta, United and American Airlines suspended flights to and from mainland China

The ban, effective from Saturday, also applies to passengers in transit but exempts residents and long-term pass holders such as those on work permits, student visas or long-term visit passes, the health ministry said.

It comes as the toll from the virus has reached 213 and the World Health Organisation declared a global health emergency.

Singapore has reported 13 cases of the virus — all travellers from the Chinese city of Wuhan at the centre of the outbreak — while more than 10,000 cases have been reported globally.

"In view of the growing possibility of transmission from new travellers arriving from other parts of mainland China, the Ministry of Health has assessed that it is prudent to take additional pre-emptive measures at this stage," the ministry said in a statement.

The move to suspend visas to mainland Chinese passport holders effectively shuts out the island's largest group of visitors and will also bar other travellers who have been to China in the last 14 days.

The ban does not apply to passport holders and travellers to Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China and Singapore's main rival financial hub in Asia.

Taiwan has similar measures in place, while Japan is banning entry to Chinese with passports issued in Hubei province — the epicentre of the outbreak.

Singapore was one of the worst-hit countries outside of China in the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which killed 774 people globally.

The number of coronavirus cases has now surpassed the SARS epidemic, which reported 8,100 cases in around 25 countries during an eight-month outbreak.

US, Solomon Islands impose travel restrictions

The US also ramped up its response to the coronavirus epidemic, saying it would halt entry to the country of foreign nationals who had been to China within the 14-day incubation period.

"Following the World Health Organisation decision, I have today declared that the coronavirus represents a public health emergency in the United States," Health Secretary Alex Azar said at a news conference.

As of Sunday, US citizens who had been in Hubei would undergo compulsory quarantine, he said. Foreign nationals who had travelled in China in the last 14 days would be denied entry, he said, citing the need to relieve pressure on authorities.

Solomon Islands took their travel restrictions a step further, announcing regulations restricting the entry of any person who has travelled to any countries with confirmed cases of coronavirus, which has now spread to 25 countries and regions —including Australia — with the UK and Russia confirming their first cases.

A statement released by the Office of the Prime Minister and Cabinet advised that anyone who had visited a country with a confirmed case in the past 14 days "will not be allowed to enter the country and will be requested to board the return flight or be subject to detention or quarantine".

The statement said that in addition to members of the public, these restrictions also applied to Government Officials and Members of Parliament.

"The Government acknowledges the risks associated with the outbreak of diseases as a matter of National Security," the statement said.

El Salvador and Guatemala also announced blanket restrictions on people who have recently been in China.

Airlines suspend flights

US carriers Delta, United and American Airlines joined a long list of airlines around the world that have suspended or cut back services to parts of mainland China in response to the spread of coronavirus.

The suspensions came after the US State Department issued a level 4 "Do Not Travel" advisory — the highest grade of warning — and told Americans in China to consider departing using commercial means.

"Travellers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice," the advisory said.

British Airways has suspended all flights to and from mainland China, while other carriers including Finnair, Vietnam Airlines, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, Korean Air and Singapore-based Jetstar Asia have slashed services.

Italy's aviation authority said all flights between China and Italy were suspended until further notice after the country reported its first two cases of the virus.

Air India and South Korean budget carrier Seoul Air have also halted all flights to the country, and Indonesia's Lion Air plans to do the same.

While the Federal Government's Smart Traveller website has advised Australians to reconsider their need to travel to China, flights are still readily available to and from mainland China.

However, Qantas is offering full refunds to passengers who bought tickets to China on or before January 24.
