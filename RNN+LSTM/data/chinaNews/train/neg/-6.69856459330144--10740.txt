Health services lawmaker, Joseph Lee, said today that there is still a high risk of Hong Kong suffering an outbreak of the new Wuhan coronavirus, RTHK reports.

The cases of a husband and wife in Wuhan have given rise to concerns of human-to-human transmission.

Mainland authorities acknowledged for the first time this week that the new coronavirus that's infected at least 41 people in Wuhan, may be spreading between humans, although they say the possibility of this is low.

Hong Kong has been isolating people who have fallen ill after visiting Wuhan, but so far there have been no confirmed cases in the SAR.

Lee expressed concern about whether Hong Kong's overloaded public hospitals could cope with an outbreak, noting that it's the height of the flu season.

He suggested health officials step up surveillance at ports, addibng that it's important to do this in the run-up to the Lunar New Year.

He said Taiwan and Singapore had gone further in their efforts to identify people who could be suffering from the Wuhan virus and to isolate them.

He said similar measures would reassure the public that the government is doing its best to limit the outbreak.
