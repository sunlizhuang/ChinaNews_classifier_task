Georgia health officials are monitoring nearly 200 Georgia residents who have recently traveled to China, where a deadly new coronavirus has sickened more than 40,000 people.

None of the residents visited China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of coronavirus outbreak, but they did travel through other parts of the country, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health.

All have been under self-quarantine, which means staying at home for 14 days, the illness’ incubation period. No one has shown symptoms of coronavirus.

Since February 2, U.S. citizens returning home from visits to the Hubei have been quarantined. Those who have been to other parts of China are subject to “proactive entry screening” and up to 14 days of monitoring and self-quarantine.
