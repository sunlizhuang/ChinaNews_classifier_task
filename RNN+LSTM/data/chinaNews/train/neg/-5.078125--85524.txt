China has fast-tracked new laws prohibiting the consumption of wild animals in a bid to tackle the unprecedented coronavirus crisis.

The multi-billion dollar trade ban will come into effect immediately, the South China Morning Post reported.

“Since the Covid-19 outbreak, the eating of wild animals and the huge hidden threat to public health from the practice have attracted wide attention,” the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress said on Monday, it was reported.

It comes as the number of deaths from the novel coronavirus has risen to more than 2,600 across the world.

Europe’s biggest outbreak is in Italy, where seven people have died and restrictions have been imposed on some municipalities.

A team of health experts from the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have now arrived in the country to “support Italian authorities in understanding the situation”, WHO said in a statement.

Their focus will be on “limiting further human-to-human transmission,” it said.

“WHO experts are providing support in the areas of clinical management, infection prevention and control, surveillance and risk communication,” the statement said.

The WHO said it is concerned over what it calls the “rapid” increase in reported cases in Italy. “However, it should also be noted that based on current data, in the majority of cases (4 out of every 5) people experience mild or no symptoms,” it added.
