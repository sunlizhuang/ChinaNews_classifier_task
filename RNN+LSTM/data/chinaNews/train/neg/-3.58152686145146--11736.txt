Lawmakers are debating whether to exclude Huawei from 5G bids. Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is opposed to a ban, is facing a rebellion from her intelligence agencies, who are worried about America’s threat to limit intelligence sharing if Huawei is allowed to participate. China is also not shy about exploiting the fact that German automakers like VW, BMW, Audi and Daimler, who work closely with Huawei, depend on the company.

Quotable: “Just because we have an American president who doesn’t like alliances, we give all that up?” said a former German foreign minister and vice chancellor. “Why would we? Especially since he does exactly what the Chinese do and threatens the German car industry.”
