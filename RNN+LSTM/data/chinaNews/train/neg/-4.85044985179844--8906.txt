The Chinese government’s use of the social credit system, repression of Uighur Muslims and crackdown on Hong Kong protesters presents an “existential threat” to the world, the US-based Human Rights Watch organisation has warned, as it heaps pressure on the United Nations to publicly condemn Beijing.

In a 652-page global report heavily focused on the Chinese government, the advocacy group said, if not challenged, Beijing’s actions “portend a dystopian future in which no one is beyond the reach of Chinese censors” and “an international human rights system so weakened that it no longer serves as a check on government repression”.

The Chinese mission to the UN interrupted the press conference in New York on Wednesday morning to condemn the findings. “The report is full of prejudices and fabrications and ignores the factual information provided by my government,” spokesman Ji Shing told the media briefing.

Human Rights Watch executive director Kenneth Roth had originally planned to present the report in Hong Kong but was barred from entering by authorities on Sunday. In a tense exchange, Mr Roth was told by Mr Ji, the report “made it clear” why he was denied entry.
