The human mind works in the most amazing ways. It is so unpredictable in its wiring and synapses, we want nothing more than to credit it for all the ‘good’ that our kind has experienced on the planet.

But I feel our mind’s tendency to poke around until our curious brain cells have been satisfied, is its greatest capability. Of course besides furnishing mind-boggling, truly-convincing but so-damn-unnerving conspiracy theories that will unsettle the nerd inside us.

With Coronavirus claiming its 2000+ victim recently, crazy conspiracy theories are pouring in thick and heavy, so let’s dive right into the top 6 conspiracy theories around recent virus infection outbreaks around the world:

1. Novel Coronavirus

Social media was abuzz with recent posts on Twitter which claimed that the reason why Wuhan became the epicentre of the deadly epidemic is because this is a case of Chinese manufacturing of a ‘bio-weapon gone wrong. It is also suggested that it was meant to target the rival powers of the world.



I told you all so. The #coronavirus is a #Wuhan-made #bioweapon that was either released intentionally or accidentally. Either way, this is a MAJOR SCANDAL. #China needs to be held accountable. https://t.co/WKLSHBUQMh — 🇺🇸 Cory Groshek 🇺🇸 (@CoryGroshek) February 3, 2020

Alternatively, others have claimed that the outbreak was orchestrated by the United States to inhibit China’s momentous growth and bring down its economy. But the most amazing of them all is the theory which suggests that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation planned the outbreak as a population control measure.

2. SARS

Back in 2003, when the SARS outbreak in China was at its peak, Russian scientist Sergei Kolesnikov claimed that SARS coronavirus was a mix of measles and mumps, and thus, the virus had to have been created in a lab. However, independent labs rejected the theory mixing two paramyxoviruses cannot create a coronavirus.



To add to the above claim, in the same year a Chinese lawyer and a volunteer in a 1998 Chinese-American medical cooperation program, named Tong Zeng claimed in his book titled The Last Defense Line: Concerns About the Loss of Chinese Genes that SARS could be a US-created bio-weapon meant to harm China.

Tong revealed how American research groups had secured close to 5000 samples of blood, DNA and specimens of mainland Chinese twins in the 1990s. He suggested that the samples which were sent to America were now being used as bio-weapons.

What really gave a boost to this claim was that the samples had been taken from all the 22 Chinese provinces which were hit by SARS in 2003.

3. AIDS

In a study conducted by Laura Bogart of RAND Corporation and Sheryl Thorburn of Oregon State University, it was found that most African Americans believed AIDS was created in the government laboratories to keep a check on the black population, and even though they knew of the cure, the poor were denied it.



In his book Behold a Pale Horse Milton William Cooper also suggested that AIDS was a product of a government-CIA conspiracy to limit the black, Hispanic, and homosexual population in the country. To this day, many believe that the CIA intentionally infected thousands of African Americans with AIDS under the guise of hepatitis vaccinations.

4. Ebola

The biggest conspiracy theory that gave health workers sleepless nights was the claim that the outbreak was propagated, and a big hoax. This even led to the murder of eight relief workers in Guinea which was a result of distrust between villagers and the government, who believed Ebola “is nothing more than an invention of white people to kill black people.”



An Al Jazeera report in 2014 also claimed that “many Guineans say local and foreign healthcare workers… [invented Ebola] as a means of luring Africans to clinics to harvest their blood and organs.” The belief found a strong footing because Ebola victims were asked to be buried instead of doing it the traditional way.

5. Zika Virus

A survey conducted by the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Public Policy Center had found that a third of the US population believed that genetically modified mosquitoes caused the spread of Zika. It all started with a Reddit post “Genetically modified mosquitoes released in Brazil in 2015 linked to the current Zika epidemic?” which suggested that Oxitec, a British company that modifies mosquitoes might have created the epidemic because many cases of microcephaly had been reported from around Juazeiro in Brazil, where Oxitec introduced modified mosquitoes in 2012.

Additionally, other theories also implied at the participation of the Bill Gates Foundation as a cause since the Foundation had given away $19.7 million for a project to develop and test GM mosquitoes.

6. Swine Flu

Many conspiracy theorists and their supporters have come to believe that swine flu got to such a dangerous stage alarm because of the pressure from drug companies who wanted to make a profit from the outbreak of swine flu. Even the WHO was accused of being part of a worldwide conspiracy wherein they ‘created a pandemic' that didn't really exist just in order to help the drug companies.
