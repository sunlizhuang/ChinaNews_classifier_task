Cathay Pacific will cut flights into mainland China by at least 50pc as fears over the coronavirus outbreak intensify.

The Hong Kong flag carrier said it would reduce its flight capacity from January 30 to the end of March following a government response plan and in view of market demand.

The coronavirus, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan and causes pneumonia-like symptoms, has now claimed the lives of more than 130 people.

In a brief statement Cathay Pacific said: “We are actively reviewing our flight schedules at the moment and will be updating them progressively over the next 48 hours.”

The company added that any rebooking, rerouting and refund charges will be waived for all tickets issued worldwide on or before January 28 for travel on Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon bookings. These are for flights arriving to or departing from mainland China between 28 January and 31 March.

It has advised passengers to check their flight status and timetables on the website for the latest information.

Hong Kong has already cut all its transport links with China in a bid to isolate the virus after the first six cases of coronavirus identified in the city entered through the high-speed rail link from China.
