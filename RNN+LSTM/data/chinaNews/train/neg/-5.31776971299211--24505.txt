A second case of the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, leaving more than 40 people dead and causing quarantines throughout China, has been confirmed in the United States. Officials said Friday that a Chicago woman in her 60s has been diagnosed with the virus, and they're monitoring 63 other possible cases across 22 U.S. states. The Chicago patient, who last week returned home from Wuhan, is reportedly isolated in the hospital, and officials say she's doing well and has had limited contact with others. The U.S. is reportedly planning to evacuate its citizens and diplomats from Wuhan on Sunday. Hong Kong, where there's five confirmed cases, declared Saturday the outbreak "an emergency," scrapping Lunar New Year celebrations and restricting links to the mainland. Australia, Malaysia, and France also reported cases.
