Last week, five inmates broke a window at the local correctional center and fled. Police were called early today for another inmate who failed to return from supervised release.

CANTON, Ohio — As two of five escapees from a community correctional institution remain at large Monday, police began looking for another inmate who did not return from her supervised release.

Canton Police reports show the inmate was reported missing at 3 a.m. Monday from the Stark Regional Community Corrections Center at 4433 Lesh Road NE.

SRCCC did not immediately return a message Monday seeking comment.

Investigating officers could not be reached for comment.

But the police investigation labeled the incident as an escape.

Five other inmates escaped a week ago, but they were not on supervised release. Police reports showed the men broke out a first-floor window and fled.

One of them, identified as Jaden Miller, 23, was later captured by Carroll County Sheriff’s deputies at a home near Carrollton.

Joshua Bingham, 36, of North Canton, was captured Friday in a mobile home parking lot in North Canton by agents with the U.S. Marshals Violent Fugitive Task Force, Canton police detectives and Stark County Sheriff's deputies.

Three other inmates — Michael Fisher, 29, listed as homeless; Jason Drake, 39, of Waynesburg; and Vincent Blanc, 24, of Canton — remain at large.
