Mosaic Life Care in northwest Missouriâ€™s St. Joseph will begin screening for the coronavirus, which has caused more than 100 deaths in China.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have confirmed five U.S. and are keeping track of 110 potential cases, all from people who recently visited China. One patient is under investigation in Missouri after testing negative for the disease with flu-like symptoms. Folk says Mosaic will begin asking those admitted to the hospital whether they have traveled to Wuhan, China in the last two weeks. If not, Mosaic will ask if the patient has been in contact with someone who has been to Wuhan in the last 14 days.

The virus surfaced last month in Wuhan, China, infecting nearly 6,000 people, resulting in more than 100 deaths. Five cases have been confirmed in the United States, all from people who recently visited Wuhan. There are more than 100 suspected cases in the U.S., none reported to be in Missouri, but there is a case being investigated in Kansas.
