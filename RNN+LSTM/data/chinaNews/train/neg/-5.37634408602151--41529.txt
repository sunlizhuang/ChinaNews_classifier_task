In wake of the World Health Organization’s decision to declare the coronavirus as a world health emergency, Guyana has made the decision to restrict and closely monitor travel between Guyana and China, where the virus originated.

In a statement this morning, the Ministry of Health announced that persons in China who plan to travel to Guyana should defer those plans until further notice, as they are likely to be denied entry.

Additionally, those in Guyana who plan to travel to China are being advised to postpone those plans.

The statement said persons arriving in Guyana from China will be subject to quarantine protocols and may be quarantined in a health facility or at home, depending on the outcome of the risk assessment.

And all recent travelers from China (after Jan 1st) already in Guyana are asked to contact their nearest health Centre or hospital urgently and to remain at home for 14 days after the date of arrival.

The Health Ministry said if flu-like symptoms arise within 14 days after return to Guyana from China or another highly affected country, those persons are asked to call the hotline on 592 227 8683 ext 215.

China has now recorded over 10,000 cases of the coronavirus with more than 200 deaths.

Although Guyana is considered at low risk, the screening of passengers at all ports of entry started last weekend.

The Novel Coronavirus is similar to the virus that causes the common cold and many of its symptoms are flu-like.

Whilst the death rate associated with the virus is low at around 2% the infection rate, its spread, has been termed ‘worrying’ by the WHO.
