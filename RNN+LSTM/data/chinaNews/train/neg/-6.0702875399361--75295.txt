HENRICO COUNTY, Va. -- With the number of coronavirus cases in China now surpassing 72,000 and the death toll at more than 1,800, U.S. officials are doing everything possible to combat the spread of the virus.

In Virginia, six people have tested negative for the coronavirus, while several other travelers are currently being monitored. However, fears of a potential outbreak have local leaders preparing.

On Tuesday, Tuckahoe district Supervisor Patricia O’Bannon will host a town hall meeting to explain what is responsible for the outbreak of the respiratory illness, signs and symptoms of the virus, and how residents can prepare for an emergency- including a potential quarantine.

“No one should be afraid,” O’Bannon said. “This is the idea that you are prepared before there’s a crisis, before there’s a big emergency and before quarantining or anything like that is called out. You should know everything you can about the subject.”

The town hall meeting will be interactive and streamed live. Speakers include Melissa Viray, Deputy Director of the Henrico County and City of Richmond health districts. Emily Ashley, Henrico County Emergency Manager and Sara Morris, a county advocate for the Aging.

“(Morris) is going to talk about how Henrico County has a system where you can get a phone call a day and they can send someone out to help you if you’re sick,” O’Bannon says. “If there’s a quarantine, you’d ask questions such as ‘how would I get groceries if nobody could go out?’ This would be the type of thing to ask.”

Residents can also attend the meeting’s initial session, which will be held from 1 to 2 p.m. at Deep Run Recreation Center, 9900 Ridgefield Parkway, or watch via a livestream on the Henrico County government channel on YouTube.

A session from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. will occur only on livestream.
