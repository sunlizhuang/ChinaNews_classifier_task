Sir,

Apropos “UoM restricts entry of private vehicles into Gangothri Campus” (SOM dated Feb.4) is a most welcome move, though belated, to retain and regain the glory of the very name itself “Manasa Gangothri.”

Prior to this, vehicle population was equivalent to humans (inhumans) choking all roads and junctions and a drivers track including plying of driving school vehicles also adding to noise and air pollution above permissible limits.

Vehicles of uncivilised people trespassing into Gangothri campus were making disturbing, distracting noise pollution by altered silencers, terrorising with high decibel China horns, twin tone horns with cut-outs blowing them even when not required for cheap thrill. Trespassers are seen smoking in non-smoking zones, parking their vehicles haphazardly.

Many a time it is observed hapless teachers, while delivering lectures, have to pause for a while till the vehicle passed by and noise level came down. Monograms, hoods of vehicles and petrol were stolen till the last drop is exhausted from vehicles especially from bikes when the owners were concentrating on studies and research inside, forcing them to push the heavy bikes all the way to petrol bunks after a tedious routine totally exhausted.

I also request the authorities concerned to shift the central facilities like Canteens, Banks, Post Office and Administrative Office to the periphery of the campus to benefit the genuine law-abiding patrons. When the traffic is thin anybody can have a pleasurable walk, enjoying the beauty of the serene campus.
