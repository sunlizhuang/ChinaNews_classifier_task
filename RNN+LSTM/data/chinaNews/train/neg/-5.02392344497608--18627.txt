PAHO alerts Americas over coronavirus' outbreak

22 de enero de 2020, 11:49Panama, Jan 22 (Prensa Latina) The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued on Wednesday recommendations to the regional governments regarding the outbreak of coronavirus in China, whose cases extend to three other Asian countries and the United States.

In the US, a case was reported yesterday, a person who recently traveled to the Chinese city of Wuhan, where nine deaths were reported.According to PAHO, uncertainty about the new pathogen continues along with the spectrum of manifestations that it may cause, as well as the source of infection, the way of transmission, the incubation period, the disease severity and the specific control measures.Current evidence suggests that person-to-person transmission is limited, which would be consistent with what is known about other similar pathogens.In particular, person-to-person transmission, included in the nosocomial (in-hospital) environment, has been documented for other emerging corona viruses, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the coronavirus causative agent of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV).Therefore, the entity underlines, the control measures taken for SARS and MERS can temporarily guide the response against this new pathogen.mh/omr/mgt/alb
