(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus outbreak spread further outside China, sparking concerns about a pandemic. Italy reported at least six deaths, and the country’s financial hub is in virtual lockdown.

While the head of the World Health Organization called the new cases “deeply concerning,” he said the outbreak isn’t yet a global pandemic.

Infections spiked again in South Korea and Iran, while Afghanistan, Bahrain and Kuwait all reported their first cases. That dented markets globally -- European equities fell the most since June 2016 and the yield on 10-year Treasuries dropped to the lowest since that year. U.S. stocks plunged the most since August.

The WHO said China’s unprecedented lockdown may have averted hundreds of thousands of cases. The United Nations agency also said that Gilead Sciences Inc.’s experimental drug that is being tested for coronavirus may be the only one that will work.
