TOKYO/WASHINGTON/MADRID (Feb 10): The global death toll from the coronavirus outbreak reached at least 904, as the World Health Organization’s chief voiced concern over the spread of the disease from people with no travel history to China.

Stocks in Asia were likely heading for a cautious start Monday as investors monitor the toll from the illness.

WHO Chief Concerned Over Virus Spread (6:35 a.m. HK)

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet that there have been concerning instances of coronavirus being spread from people with no travel history to China, saying “we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg” when it comes to the virus.

“The detection of a small number of cases may indicate more widespread transmission in other countries,” he said in the tweet.

He called on countries to step up efforts to prepare for the coronavirus’s possible arrival. Donors have contributed toward the WHO’s efforts and those directed at vulnerable countries, he said, but the organization hasn’t reached its goal of $675 million to fight the coronavirus.

A World Health Organization assistant director-general, Bruce Aylward, will lead a team of medical experts heading to China as the nation fights the coronavirus outbreak.

Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a tweet called Aylward a “veteran of past public health emergencies.” An advance team left Geneva for China on Sunday, he said. Aylward ran a review that led to the first system-wide activation procedures for major infectious disease emergencies, according to the WHO’s website.

WHO also will hold a global forum Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva to accelerate research into the coronavirus outbreak, Ghebreyesus said in a separate tweet.

The organizer, GSM Association, said Sunday the event will be held, acknowledging “some large exhibitors” withdrew but that more than 2,800 plan to attend. Travelers from Hubei are barred and travelers to China must prove they left the country more than 14 days earlier.

Li said China’s actions exceed recommendations of the World Health Organization. “The Chinese government and people are confident and capable of winning the fight against the epidemic,” he said, the state-run news agency reported.

China Rejects Virus Speculation (12:30 a.m. NY)

China’s ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai, dismissed suggestions the coronavirus originated from a military laboratory or was part of biological warfare research, and warned against such speculation.

”I think it’s true that a lot is still unknown and our scientists, Chinese scientists, American scientists, scientists of other countries, are doing their best to learn more about the virus,” Cui said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation” broadcast.

“It’s very harmful, it’s very dangerous to stir up suspicion, rumors and spread them among the people. For one thing, this will create panic. Another thing, that it will fan up racial discrimination, xenophobia.”

Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, last month in a tweet said Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak, has China’s only laboratory that works with deadly pathogens including coronavirus.

Cui also said he expects medical experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be part of the global health team of the World Health Organization traveling to China this week.

“We welcome the American experts to participate in our efforts,” Cui said, dismissing suggestions the Beijing government was refusing U.S. offers of assistance.

screening is occurring,” Wolf said Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”

The U.S. also is checking cargo ships with crew from China to make sure none have the virus or show symptoms. If they do, “we are holding them out of the port,” he said.

For a week, the U.S. has diverted passengers who visited China to 11 airports that Wolf said handle “the vast majority of traffic from China.”
