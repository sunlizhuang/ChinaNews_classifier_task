Mr Hunt said the government had been very cautious and medical advice would guide decisions over the ban.

"We are very aware, deeply aware, of the economic consequences," he said.

"But the consequences of contagion within Australia at an economic, let alone more significantly a human level, would be extraordinary."

Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee would discuss whether to extend the ban or lift it.

"The important consideration is we are still containing the virus in Australia. We've only had 15 cases and there is still risk associated with the outbreak in many of the provinces of China," he told the ABC.

"We have to look at all of the factors but we are also very aware this travel ban has had a huge impact on students and tourism and other economic factors."

Professor Murphy said there were two scenarios experts were looking at when determining whether to lift the travel ban.

"One is when we are pretty confident the outbreak is controlled in the provinces of China other than Wuhan (city) and Hubei province. We know that the Hubei province is locked down at the moment but if the growth in other provinces stopped and the disease seemed to be under control in those provinces it would be a good basis for stopping [the ban]," he said.

"Clearly the other, less attractive option would be if there were spread of the virus to many countries and we had widespread transmission in the form of a global pandemic and then travel bans probably don't add any value in those circumstances."
