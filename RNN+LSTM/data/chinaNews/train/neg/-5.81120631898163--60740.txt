SCRANTON

Buses transporting about 150 local people to a cruise ship in New Jersey turned around at the pier Friday amid coronavirus concerns aboard the vessel, TravelWorld owner John Madden said.

The Royal Caribbean Anthem of the Seas docked Friday in Bayonne, New Jersey, where a number of passengers were screened for the deadly virus that originated in Wuhan, China, according to local media in New Jersey.

The bus passengers from the Scranton and Wilkes-Barre areas were slated to embark Friday on an eight-day Valentine’s Day cruise aboard the ship. The ship has been cleared to leave today and the cruise shortened to seven days, Madden said, noting Royal Caribbean will credit passengers for the lost day.
