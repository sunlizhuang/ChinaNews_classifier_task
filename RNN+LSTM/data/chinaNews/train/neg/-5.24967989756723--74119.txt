Chinese mememakers have hit back at Denmark after a Danish Newspaper mocked the Chinese flag amid the outbreak of the deadly Coronavirus.

Earlier this week, the Chinese embassy in Denmark demanded an apology from Jyllands-Posten, the publication responsible for the cartoon which caused mass outrage.

The cartoon depicted the Chinese flag’s stars as enlarged microscopic animations of viruses after the deadly flu-like virus claimed over a hundred lives as well as recorded confirmed cases in several countries.

In a tweet compiling the attempts to mock the Danish flags, China’s top memesmiths presented their best efforts.

The tweet reads: “A Danish newspaper made a Coronavirus version of the Chinese flag which made China mad and hurt their precious feelings.

“In retaliation the Chinese made these, ahem, epic burns on the Danish flag.

“How will Denmark ever recover?”

Many of the memes attempt to photoshop a colorful array of emoji feces onto the Danish flag, while others attempt to convey an expletive-laden message. Another made a penile attempt at recreating the Danish flag.

Son of Bitch！Danish flags for you.

This particular meme maker creatively turned used sanitary pads into the Danish cross, converted a coffin into the flag, as well as posting some indecipherable images to somewhat imply the Danish flag.

Another tweeter said: “It is wrong to insult the national flag of another country.Don’t use freedom of speech as a shield. Anddon’t fucking forget, we in China also support freedom of speech,4- hour surrender idiots, and boycott crap eating Danish junk brands.”

This particular tweeter felt the need to draw comparisons between Denmark and Nazism.

Creative energies were channeled to redesign the Danish crosses into outstretched arms flying a middle finger.

According to Article 110 of the Danish Criminal Law: Anyone who publicly insults a foreign flag, or other recognized flag, will be fined or imprisoned for up to two years.

A meme war was waged by the Danish PM’s dry reply of “We have Free Speech,” to the brewing diplomatic incident.

A strange international feud appears to be fought out via proxy mememakers as China continues to battle to contain the spread and death toll of the deadly virus.

Coronavirus update:

– 7,811 confirmed cases worldwide

– 12,167 suspected cases

– 170 fatalities

– 1,370 in serious/critical condition

– 124 treated and released

– All regions of China reporting cases

– 17 countries reporting cases — BNO Newsroom (@BNODesk) January 30, 2020

On the original incident which prompted the furious meme retaliation, National File reported:

A Danish newspaper sparked outrage in China over a cartoon featured within the publication, mocking the Chinese flag following the outbreak of the deadly Coronavirus which has affected thousands.

The cartoon which was published in Jyllands-Posten on Monday depicted the stars of the Chinese flag as microscopic shots of viruses. Since publishing the cartoon, Jyllands-Posten has refused to apologize for the cartoon which has been described to have hurt “the feelings of the Chinese people,” according to the Chinese embassy in Denmark. The embassy has also said that the cartoon is “an insult to China” and that it had crossed an “ethical boundary of free speech.” France 24 also reported that the embassy demanded that the artist, Niels Bo Bojesen, and his publication “reproach themselves for their mistake and publicly apologize to the Chinese people.”

The Chinese memesmiths appear to have been unsuccessful in their international retaliation campaign.
