A 44-year-old-man has died in the Philippines from the coronavirus, making him the first to die from the virus outside of China.

The patient was a Chinese man from Wuhan in Hubei province, where the virus was first detected.

He appeared to have been infected before arriving in the Philippines, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said.

A WHO spokesman said: "This is the first known death of someone with 2019-nCoV outside of China."

Health officials in the country say the man arrived on January 21st with a 38-year-old woman who remains under observation.

He was admitted to a hospital in the capital, Manila, and then developed severe pneumonia.

Rabindra Abeyasinghe, the WHO representative to the Philippines, urged people to remain calm: "This is the first reported death outside China.

â€œHowever, we need to take into mind that this is not a locally acquired case. This patient came from the epicentre of this outbreak."

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the patient was "stable and showed signs of improvement", but his condition deteriorated rapidly over 24 hours.

"We are currently working with the Chinese embassy to ensure the dignified management of the remains according to national and international standards to contain the disease," he added.

The Department of Health is now trying to track down people who were on the flight so they can be quarantined.

The Philippine government has also expanded its travel ban to include all foreigners coming from China.

More than 300 people have been killed by the coronavirus, with over 14,000 infections confirmed.
