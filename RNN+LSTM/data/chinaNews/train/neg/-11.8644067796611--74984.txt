China has condemned the unilateral sanctions imposed by the United States on foreign companies. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated China's opposition to the sanctions and urged Washington to correct its mistake at once.

The U.S. announced on February 14, it was imposing sanctions on companies from China, Russia, Turkey and Iraq under a U.S. law on non-proliferation of nuclear and chemical materials. The law specifically restricts trade with Iran, the DPRK and Syria.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said American unilateralism and lack of respect for international rules were seriously undermining global non-proliferation efforts. He said the Iran nuclear issue was a case in point.
