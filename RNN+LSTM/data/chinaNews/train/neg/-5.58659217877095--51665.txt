Taipei, Feb. 4 (CNA) The Coast Guard Administration (CGA) on Tuesday stepped up patrols in western Taiwan and around the offshore county of Penghu, as part of the central government's efforts to combat the novel coronavirus outbreak that originated in China.

The 1,800-ton class Wei-Hsing and 1,000-ton class Hsun-Hu No. 7 patrol vessels are being stationed on the southern and northern side of Penghu to monitor and intercept Chinese boats that trespass into Taiwan waters, the CGA said.

Chinese fishing vessels illegally entering Taiwan's waters potentially present a gap in efforts to prevent the disease from spreading further, it added.

Meanwhile, the two patrol vessels will work with helicopters deployed by the National Airborne Service Corp. to spot and stop any trespassing Chinese boats.

The vessels will also patrol waters from central to northwest Taiwan, potential hotspots for illegal trespassers, it said, noting that Taiwanese vessels are encouraged to call the CGA toll-free hotline 118 to report any suspected unlawful activities.
