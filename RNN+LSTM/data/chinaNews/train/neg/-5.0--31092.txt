Victoria tourism officials are watchful but not overly alarmed about travel restrictions imposed in China to halt the spread of a new virus.

“We are in prudent observation mode right now,” said Paul Nursey, president of Destination Greater Victoria. “We are talking with our industry partners and our government partners to see how things play out.”

Nursey said Chinese visitors account for only four per cent of overnight stays recorded annually in Victoria, so effects are expected to be small.

The China Tourism Association has posted travel limitations to contain the spread of the virus. Chinese officials have not said how long the restrictions will last.

All tourist groups outbound from China were stopped Monday. Overseas flights and hotel bookings through travel agencies were also halted.

Nursey said while loss of Chinese visitors will hurt, his association is fully on board with the moves undertaken in China.

“We think it’s responsible and prudent,” he said.

Nursey said most of the overnight stays in Victoria are generated from relatively short distances away — Seattle, Vancouver, Calgary and Toronto — not overseas.

He said people who come from overseas are often part of a tour attached to something larger. They might take a tour of the Canadian Rockies with a short extension for a visit to Victoria and Vancouver Island.

“We are mostly a getaway destination,” said Nursey. “That’s our bread and butter.”
