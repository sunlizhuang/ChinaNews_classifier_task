Beijing: Wuhan's mayor offered to resign on Monday after admitting that the city's response to the coronavirus outbreak, which has now killed more than 80 people and infected some 2900, was too slow.

Zhou Xianwang, Wuhan's top government official, conceded in a candid interview with a state broadcaster that the initial management of the epidemic and the speed at which information was shared with the public was "not good enough".

"We locked down the city to cut the spread of virus, but it's likely we'll leave a bad reputation in history," Zhou told China Central Television, while wearing a blue surgical face mask.

"As long as it helps contain the spread of virus, I'm willing to resign as a form of apology," he added.
