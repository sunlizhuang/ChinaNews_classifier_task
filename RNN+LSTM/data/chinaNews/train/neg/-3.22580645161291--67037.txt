We stand against any foreign interference in the internal affairs of Venezuela and against unilateral sanctions," said the diplomat.Since 2019, the United States in particular, and some other countries due to pressure from Washington, began applying new sanctions to Caracas, which seriously affected its economy, people's lives and Venezuela's relations with other nations, Geng Shuang recalled."We urge other countries to take into account the humanitarian reality of Venezuela, stop imposing uniteral and extraterritorial sanctions, and work to create necessary conditions that will lead to the stability of their economic growth," said Geng.
