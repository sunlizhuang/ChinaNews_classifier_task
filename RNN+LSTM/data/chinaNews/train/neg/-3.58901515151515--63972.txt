Mainland China has reported another rise in cases of the new coronavirus after a sharp decline the previous day, while the number of deaths grow by 97 to 908, with at least two more outside the country.

China’s health ministry said another 3,062 cases had been reported over the previous 24 hours, raising the Chinese mainland’s total to 40,171.

The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China increased by 97, the largest in a single day so far, to 908 as of the end of Sunday, the National Health Commission (NHC) said today.

Earlier, France closed two schools after five British visitors contracted the virus at a ski resort. Malaysia, South Korea and Vietnam reported one new case each.

Meanwhile, the mother of a physician who died last week in the hardest-hit city of Wuhan said she wants an explanation from authorities who reprimanded her son for warning about the virus.

Today’s rise was a turnaround from a significant reduction in new cases reported Sunday, 2,656, down by about 20 percent from the 3,399 new cases reported in the previous 24-hour period. That had prompted optimism that the “joint control mechanism of different regions and the strict prevention and control measures have worked,” in the words of a spokesman for the National Health Commission, Mi Feng.-APPpatients in the isolated intensive care unit at a hospital in Wuhan in central China's Hubei province are monitored on Thursday, February 6.
