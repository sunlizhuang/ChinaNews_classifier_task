A BARROW man is one of two Cumbrians affected by the quarantines in China.

Alex Beetham, 27, travelled to China in August last year to spend a year teaching through the international education company, Education First.

Mr Beetham has been residing in Xuzhou, which is some 500km away from the epicentre of the current outbreak of Coronavirus in Wuhan.

Mr Beetham said: “We have been given three weeks off work at the moment.

“Depending on a review of the circumstances we may be back to work on February 10.

“In the meantime we are in a sort of soft quarantine, we should only leave the apartment for essentials like food and water.”

Alex, and his friend David Talbot, 23, from Whitehaven, produced a light-hearted video of themselves singing the alphabet together.

Mr Beetham said: “For every class we have there is a group chat with all of the children’s parents so they can send videos of them reviewing what we have learned.

“While classes have been cancelled our company has asked us to make videos to send to all our classes so they can practice at home while we’re off.”

Alex has found the situation to be a surreal one, saying: “The gates to most apartments have been shut now and only residents are allowed in.

“Security also takes the temperature of anyone entering to check for flu symptoms.

“When we have been out to stock up on supplies we have to wear masks.

“The streets and roads are empty which is a big change as usually it’s very crowded.”

Many friends and family members have been worried about Alex’s safety.

He said: “I’ve had lots of concerned messages, and my mum is never off the phone.”

Despite the situation, Alex says that he is not worried about catching the virus.

David Talbot, 23, Whitehaven, said: “There are more than 20 cases reported in my city, Xuzhou.”

Mr Talbot said: “I live over the road from Alex, about a two minute walk and Alex was told that someone in his block had recently visited Wuhan - but I do not know if they are infected.”
