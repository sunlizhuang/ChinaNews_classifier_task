PUTRAJAYA: The government is still waiting for a response from Beijing over its request to evacuate citizens from Wuhan following the 2019-nCoV virus outbreak.

Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said Malaysia made the request recently.

"We’ve just started our talks with China (to evacuate Malaysians from Wuhan). So far, we have not received any response," he told reporters after a session with Rural and Regional Development Ministry's strategic partners today.

After the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Dr Mahathir said Malaysia would engage with China to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak.

Dr Mahathir said Foreign Minister Datuk Saifuddin Abdullah was expected to talk with China over the matter.

Japan, France and the United States are among the countries currently taking efforts to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan.

Higher number of fatalities have been reported in China due to the virus as of today with 170 people, along with 1,700 new confirmed cases.

Foreign media reported that 37 out of 38 new deaths were from the Hubei province, the epicentre of the contagion.

Asked if the government would follow Sabah state government's move to temporary suspend all schedule and charted flights from China, Dr Mahathir replied in the negative.

"There is no need for it now. We will study if there is a need to suspend all flights (from China) or only affecting those from Wuhan and the Hubei province," he said.

Sabah deputy Chief Minister Datuk Christina Liew was reported by Borneo Post as saying the decision was made in the interest of the people’s welfare.

She, however, stressed that it was only a temporary suspension and business operations were would resume once the situation returned to normal.
