Finance minister warns of significant economic impact

Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Monday the coronavirus outbreak will have a "significant impact" on Canada's economy, with the oil patch expected to be among the sectors hardest hit.

Speaking at the Economic Club of Calgary, Morneau said the virus will have ripple effects throughout the world because of China's massive economic footprint.

A recent Bloomberg report estimates the coronavirus and efforts to contain it will cut U.S. economic growth by 0.4 per cent in the first quarter.

Lockdowns in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, and other hubs in Hubei province due to the coronavirus outbreak have led to reduced demand for many industrial inputs. Oil prices have dropped 15 per cent drop over the course of the crisis, Morneau said.

Hackers try to use outbreak fears to spread computer viruses

An American cybersecurity company says criminal groups are exploiting fears over the coronavirus to try to attack the global shipping industry.

California-based Proofpoint says it has detected a new email campaign that uses Microsoft Word attachments designed to trick recipients into installing a type of malware known as AZORult, malicious software that can steal sensitive information from a user's computer.

Proofpoint says criminals have been exploiting a vulnerability in Word to spread AZORult and other malware since at least 2016, including for downloading ransomware that can lock victims out of their systems unless they pay. However, there is currently no evidence that ransomware has been used in this latest scam.

The company says the new email scam takes advantage of concerns about the virus, and advises workers to exercise caution when presented with coronavirus-themed email messages and attachments, as well as links and websites that could be used by criminals as lures.

No plans to heighten Canadian travel advisories

Despite the uptick in cases, Canada's chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, said Monday there are no immediate plans to impose stronger border controls or isolation protocols in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

However, Tam said the rules could change at any time based on the evolution of the disease.

Global Affairs Canada has warned against all travel to China's Hubei province. The department has warned against non-essential travel to China and is suggesting Canadians now in China leave if their presence there isn't critical.

Public health officials also have asked people returning from Hubei to self-isolate for 14 days, or — if they're returning from elsewhere in China — to stay home if they experience any symptoms.
