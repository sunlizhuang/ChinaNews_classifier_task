As the new coronavirus spreads in China, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Sunday said it is in touch with the Chinese government and is exploring ‚Äòall options‚Äô to provide relief to Indians stranded in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak.

This comes as the death toll due to the virus rose to 56 in China, with 13 other countries confirming cases.

At least 700 Indians study in universities in Wuhan and its surrounding areas. While most of them reportedly left China ahead of the Chinese New Year, around 250 are still stuck in Wuhan, and the Indian government has requested China to permit them to leave the city.

Confirmed cases of the viral infection Sunday touched 2,008, including 23 from abroad. China has sealed Wuhan and 12 other cities to stop the virus from spreading.

In a series of tweets, MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is closely monitoring the situation and that no Indian citizen has been affected by the virus.

‚ÄúWe are also closely coordinating with Chinese authorities. As of now, we understand that no Indian citizens have been affected by the outbreak & that food & water supplies are available to them,‚Äù he said.

Ma Xiaowei, NHC minister in-charge, said that the authorities‚Äô understanding of the virus was ‚Äúlimited‚Äù and they were also unclear on the risks posed by possible mutations. ‚ÄúThe outbreak is expected to continue for some time,‚Äù he was quoted as saying.
