UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- China's UN envoy on Wednesday called on the international community to work together to combat terrorism in all its forms in Syria and bring terrorists to justice.

Speaking at a Security Council meeting, China's Permanent Representative to the UN Zhang Jun said that counter-terrorism in Syria should be carried out under unified standards in accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions and international law.

Humanitarian issue in Syria is intertwined with security issue, Zhang said, adding that the eradication of terrorist forces is a necessary condition for the restoration of peace in the country.

"At present, terrorist forces still occupy most of Idlib's territory, threatening the safety of civilians, destroying infrastructure and deteriorating the humanitarian situation, which should be resolutely combated," Zhang said.

He also warned that the problem of foreign terrorist fighters in Syria is prominent and has spillover effects.

"It is a common challenge and threat to the countries of origin, the countries concerned and the countries in the region, so it must be dealt with together," Zhang noted.

"According to relevant reports, women are used to provide financial support to terrorist organizations in the al-Hol camp, and various forms of 'terrorist support' should be kept vigilant," he said.

In this regard, the Chinese ambassador called on the UN secretariat to "pay close attention, collect and integrate information and inform the Security Council in a timely manner."
