A Brisbane man being tested for coronavirus has been released from isolation and deemed "no risk" to the public, Queensland's health department says.

The man had recently visited family in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, which was first detected in December, and returned from a trip there via Sydney.

"He is out of isolation, fully recovered and showing no ongoing symptoms," a Queensland Health spokesperson said.

Test results for the man are expected in the coming days when updated "primers' with details of the specific virus are received from the World Health Organisation.
