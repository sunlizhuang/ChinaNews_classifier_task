BEIJING (AP) - China's leader has called the accelerating spread of a new virus a grave situation.

Cities from the outbreak's epicenter in central China to Hong Kong are scrambling to contain an illness that has infected more than 1,200 people and killed 41.

The city of Wuhan where the outbreak started is banning most vehicles in downtown areas to restrict people's movement, while Hong Kong is closing schools for two weeks.

The vast majority of the infections and all the deaths have been in mainland China, but fresh cases are popping up.

Australia and Malaysia reported their first cases Saturday, and other countries reported additional ones.

Recently, a case of the virus has been reported in Toronto, Canada after a man returned from Wuhan, China.
