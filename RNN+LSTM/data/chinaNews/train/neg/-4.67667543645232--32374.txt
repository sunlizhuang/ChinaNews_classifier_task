The Trump government told US airlines after a meeting it was not yet cancelling flights, airline and government officials said. The administration is holding daily meetings on the coronavirus and has considered a wide range of options.

Two US officials said the government had not taken any options off the table, including a temporary ban on flights, if public health data supported the move.

On Monday Republican senator Tom Cotton urged the administration to immediately halt commercial flights from China to the United States.
