Federal health officials told lawmakers Friday that they have the resources they need to address the spread of the virus originating from Wuhan, China, although senators acknowledged the potential need for supplemental funding down the road.

The briefing for roughly two dozen senators came as the case count for the new version of coronavirus in China was rapidly increasing, prompting authorities there to effectively quarantine tens of millions of people in Wuhan and surrounding cities. Chinaâ€™s National Health Commission reported 571 cases and 17 deaths as of Thursday, though news reports on Friday said there were now more than 800 cases and at least 26 deaths.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday said the risk to the general public in the United States was low as they announced a second case here. Still, CDC officials expect the number of U.S. cases to grow since 63 individuals are under investigation as potential cases. So far, 11 of those 63 have tested negative for the virus.

Officials told lawmakers that Chinese authorities seem to be sharing information, and that local officials seemed prepared to handle additional cases that appear in the U.S.
