The Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson, Mr Geng Shuang, on Monday urged the U.S. to exercise caution and refrain from abuse of force in its face off with Iran.

Shuang made the call at a news conference when asked for comments about the current situation in the region as tensions in U.S.-Iran relations seemed escalating.

He also called on relevant parties to exercise restraint to prevent a spiral escalation of crisis in the Middle East and the Gulf region.

The U.S. claimed it targeted 52 Iranian sites, which would be hit if Iran strikes any Americans or American assets. However, Iran said some 35 U.S. targets in the region were within reach.

“Worsening of tensions in the Middle East and the Gulf region is the last thing anyone wants to see. Ensuring peace and stability in the region is of vital importance to the whole world,” Shuang said.

He noted that power politics was always resented and short-lived, adding that the U.S. military adventurism goes against basic norms governing international relations and aggravates tensions and turbulence in the region.

“We urge the U.S. not to abuse force and call on relevant parties to exercise restraint to prevent a spiral escalation. Efforts should be made to resume dialogue and consultation as soon as possible to cool off tensions,” he said.

Shuang said that China would continue to uphold an objective and just position as well as playing a constructive role in maintaining peace and security in the Middle East and the Gulf region.
