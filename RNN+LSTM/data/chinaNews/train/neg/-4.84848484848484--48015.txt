The updated death toll in China due to Coronavirus now stands at 361. According to health officials of the country, more than 2,000 new cases of the deadly virus have been reported over the past 24 hours, bringing the Chinese total to 17,205 cases. A number of countries are now evacuating their citizens from the hardest-hit Hubei province and have also restricted travel by Chinese or people who recently traveled to the country. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization has said the number of cases will keep growing because tests are pending on thousands of suspected cases.

Reopening of schools was also delayed to keep the virus from spreading further in Hubei, where the 1,000-bed hospital in the provincial capital Wuhan was completed in just 10 days. A second hospital with 1,500 beds will open within days. Restrictions were tightened still further in one city by allowing only one family member to venture out to buy supplies every other day.
