Shops across Asia are running out of facial masks as anxious citizens empty shelves of hygiene products to protect themselves against the deadly Wuhan coronavirus.

People from Beijing to California are stockpiling masks as the first line of defence from the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, which causes fever and breathing shortages, has killed 170 and infected more than 7,000, and spread beyond China's borders to at least 14 countries.

Factories are rushing to boost production and in some parts of Asia the wearing of surgical masks has become mandatory.

The surge in demand comes despite advice from public health experts that while masks, if used correctly, can help prevent the spread of disease, they cannot guarantee virus protection, and the best way to avoid getting sick is good hygiene and hand-washing. It is still not clear how 2019-nCoV spreads.

In Wuhan, in central China’s Hubei province - the epicentre of the virus - medical staff have repeatedly appealed for more supplies of protective gear. Some of that shortfall was met by the Philippines, which rushed more than 3 million masks to Hubei’s government on Sunday.
