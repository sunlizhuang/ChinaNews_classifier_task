China has revoked the press credentials of three journalists with the Wall Street Journal after the newspaper declined to apologise for a column with a headline calling China the "real sick man of Asia," the foreign ministry said on Wednesday.

Spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing made "stern representations" to the paper over the February 3 column, which China criticised as racist and denigrating its efforts to combat a coronavirus epidemic, but the paper had failed to apologise or investigate those responsible.

"The Chinese people do not welcome media that publish racist statements and maliciously attack China," Geng told a daily briefing.

"In light of this, China has decided to revoke the press cards of the three Wall Street Journal correspondents in Beijing, starting today."
