Daily deaths caused by the new coronavirus have reached another record level in China, with 73 fatalities confirmed in figures released by health authorities on Thursday morning, taking the country’s death toll to 563.

The number of new infections in mainland China and the total within its central province of Hubei – the outbreak’s epicentre – both fell on Wednesday compared with the day before. There were 3,694 additional cases in the country and 2,987 in Hubei, national and provincial health authorities announced on Thursday morning.

The last time the rise in new infection figures slowed was January 28, after the daily increase in confirmed cases again rose on Tuesday – 3,887 in China, of which 3,156 were in Hubei. There have been 565 confirmed deaths worldwide from the coronavirus since it first emerged at the end of December, and it has sickened more than 28,000.

Permits to visit Taiwan suspended for Hong Kong, Macau

Taiwan said on Thursday that it would suspend its online and landing visa services indefinitely for Hong Kong and Macau citizens, while non-citizens of Hong Kong and Macau with a history of travel to mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau are also to be barred from visiting.

“Beginning [midnight Thursday], we will suspend online and landing visa application services” until further notice, announced Chiu Chui-cheng, vice-chairman of Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, which sets the island’s policies towards mainland China.

Those with an urgent need to visit Taiwan need to apply to the self-governed island’s representative offices in Hong Kong or Macau with proof of not having travelled to mainland China in the previous 14 days, Chiu said.

The latest restriction of entry for people from those cities since the outbreak spread was necessary to protect Taiwanese people, Chiu said. Taiwan has raised its alert level for travel to Hong Kong and Macau to Level 2, indicating a potential risk; the highest alert is Level 3, advising against visiting unless strictly necessary.

Taiwan’s Centres for Disease Control (CDC) had previously said that, beginning on Friday, people arriving from Hong Kong and Macau had to conduct home or hotel quarantine for 14 days after landing. Hong Kong and Macau citizens who already had valid Taiwan entry permits issued before Friday can still enter the island but must fulfil the 14 days’ quarantine.

“Several community-transmitted cases with unknown origin have occurred in Hong Kong, indicating the possibility of an invisible chain of infection,” the Taiwan CDC said. “A worker in the gambling industry in Macau has been diagnosed with coronavirus infection, indicating a second wave of infection in Macau.”

Cruise ships banned in Taiwan

Taiwan has banned all cruise ships from docking at its ports, regardless of whether they have visited Hong Kong, Macau or mainland China after a Taiwanese woman was found to have been infected on a Japanese cruise ship.

The woman was among 20 people on board the ship to have tested positive for the coronavirus infection. About 1,000 tourists disembarked from the ship, for a day trip to Taipei and New Taipei City, when it anchored at the northern port of Keelung on January 31, according to Taiwanese immigration authorities.

Taiwan’s Tourism Bureau said tours to Hong Kong and Macau would be suspended until February 29.

Taiwan reported two more cases of confirmed coronavirus infection on Thursday, bringing the total number to 13, as its first patient was discharged from hospital after making a full recovery.

One of the new cases is a 40-year-old man who visited Wuhan on January 17 and developed symptoms a day after his return to Taiwan on February 2. The second is a 20-year-old woman who worked in Wuhan and returned to Taiwan on February 1, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said.

The woman was hospitalised on February 4 and was confirmed to have been infected on Thursday, he said.

Chen said the 55-year-old woman who had previously tested positive for the virus had been escorted home by anti-epidemic team members after she was discharged from hospital on Thursday.

Trade deal hitch

Mainland media reported on Thursday that the outbreak could prompt China to consider triggering a disaster-related clause in the trade deal it signed with the United States last month.
