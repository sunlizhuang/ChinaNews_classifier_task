The epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak, Wuhan, a city in the Chinese province of Hubei with a population of 11 million, has been under an unprecedented quarantine since January 23.

The coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, had killed at least 170 people and infected more than 7,700 worldwide — the vast majority in China — as of Thursday morning.

The number of Wuhan coronavirus infections in the mainland officially outstripped those of SARS on Wednesday morning. The number of SARS cases on the mainland topped out at 5,327.

SARS, which also originated in China, had spread to more countries and killed nearly 800 people worldwide from 2002 to 2003.

That disease, which stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome, was caused by the same viral family as 2019-nCoV.

In just a week under quarantine, Wuhan has experienced food shortages, an overwhelming number of patients, and several evacuations of foreigners from the city.

Developments in the coronavirus outbreak and how the city is coping paint a picture of panic.
