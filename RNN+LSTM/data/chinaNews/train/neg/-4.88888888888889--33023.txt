A medical student who recently returned to India from Wuhan in China was on Tuesday admitted to a hospital in Ujjain where he has been kept in an isolation ward to test for possible infection of coronavirus.

These airports include - Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Cochin, Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata respectively. All the seven identified airports have virus screening and prevention signage displayed boldly at the strategic locations.
