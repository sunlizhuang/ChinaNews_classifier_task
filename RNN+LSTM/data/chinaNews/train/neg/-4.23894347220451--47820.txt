The University has prepared FAQs for the novel coronavirus.



STUDENT MINI FAQS IN MANDARIN

ANU response

VIEW STUDENT FAQS IN MANDARIN HERE How is ANU responding to coronavirus? Our priorities are to ensure the wellbeing of our community and minimise disruption to our students' studies.

There is specific information for students who are unable to leave China below and we working on options to allow students to study remotely.

We're working very closely with health authorities to ensure our community is safe, which ranges from providing hand sanitiser to setting up accommodation for students who need to be isolated.

We are also providing assistance affected staff with a wide range of support. How do I know I'm safe from coronavirus when visiting ANU? ANU has followed the advice of health authorities every step of the way. That means everyone you meet on campus has already been through the required period of isolation.

If you're living on residences those students who require isolation according to the very strong public health precautions will be in isolation, so you won't come into contact with them.

Only those people who meet health authority criteria for isolation will be isolated. So, if a student or staff member is not isolated, regardless of their ethnicity, it is because they do not need to be.

Classes are not due to start until 24 February. This gives us plenty of time for anybody who has been to China to complete their period of isolation and get the all clear.

This is a distressing time for many of us, but it is important we look after each other. Viruses don't discriminate and neither do we. Will ANU delay the start of semester 1 or Orientation Week? Semester 1 will commence as planned on Monday 24 February 2020. Will Orientation Week still go ahead? Yes, O-Week will commence as planned. You can visit the O-week calendar for the activites on offer here. Information about online sessions will be circulated soon. I'm worried about coronavirus. Do I have to go to class? If you are feeling worried or anxious, please make use of our counselling services. Staff can access free support and counselling through the Employee Assistance program which can be reached on 1800 808 374. Students can access support via ANU Crisis Support Line on 1300 050 327 or via SMS Text message service on 0488 884 170.

Only those staff and students who have met the conditions of health authorities will be allowed to attend the University, so the risk is very low.

The normal expectations around attendance remain in place. Back to the top of page

As at 1 February 2020, mainland China is listed as "do not travel". The University does not support travel to mainland China at this time, and will be supporting staff on University business in these areas to return home safely as soon as possible.

The University will advise if previously approved travel applications to affected locations will be cancelled, and will work directly with affected staff.

Student accomodation

Will I be able to reapply for accommodation when I know when I can return to the ANU?



Yes, we would welcome you reapplying for on campus accommodation when you know your arrival date at the ANU. While we cannot guarantee accommodation preferences we will make all attempts to assist you. We will do our best to find you an accommodation service that meets your needs, and will support you to settle in if it is after the usual Orientation and welcome phase at the beginning of Semester. Please reapply through the ANU Accommodation Service email uni.accom@anu.edu.au Why are direct debits being charged for the 2020 accommodation contract even though I am affected by the Australian Government Travel Restrictions?



In 2019 many students accepted an offer to continue their residency in ANU on campus accommodation. The ANU has reserved your room so it can't be used by another student. At this time the rental payments are being deducted. The ANU is considering how to respond to the needs of students who are prevented by the Australian Government travel restrictions from coming to the ANU to commence living in their on-campus accommodation. We are working as quickly as possible to come to a decision regarding accommodation payments and will inform you as soon as possible of the options we will make available to you. I am a returning ANU student and have plans to return to my residence. With the current travel restrictions I remain off-shore. Will my room access card be disabled if I can't travel to Australia or will the card remain active and allow me access to my room when I return? Yes, please be reassured that your room access card will be reactivated on your return and you will be given full access to the residence and room. It is recommended that you do email your residence with your revised travel plans and new arrival date so that the residential team can be on hand to welcome you back and to make sure that any practical advice or assistance can be provided to you. How will other residents and staff be kept safe during the period of time when ANU accommodation services are hosting people who are completing their self isolation period? The ANU takes the health and safety of its students and staff very seriously. The ANU residential community is being proactively provided with up to date health and safety measures that they can take to ensure that all staff, students, contractors and other who visit the campus remain healthy. This includes the use of hand sanitising, face masks and a 14-day self-isolation in dedicated residences.



The ANU continues to follow the guidelines as published by the Australian Department of Health, ACT Chief Health Officer and Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer. If residents or staff feel unwell, and/or if they have been in contact with students who may have been in Hubei Province prior to the introduction of the recent travel measures, the ANU will enforce the protocols as described by the authorities. For more information, please refer to the ANU website: https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/coronavirus-advice-0 Will the arrangements for accommodation impact on access to accommodation for people who have been guaranteed ANU accommodation in either Semester 1 or Semester 2



Yes. If students from the areas affected by the coronavirus travel ban cancel their Semester 1 2020 contract and elect to start in Semester 2 2020, the accommodation guarantee still applies. For non-guaranteed students who have been affected by the coronavirus travel ban, they would be made a priority for Semester 2 2020. How will the travel restrictions or self-isolation affect my accommodation contract? This is a complex issue. We appreciate this is a stressful time and are working to provide an update soon. How will rooms used for self isolation be made safe for future residents after they have been used for self isolation?



All rooms used by a person who is required to self-isolate will be cleaned and sanitised according to requirements set by the health authorities prior to them being occupied by another resident. My accommodation offer is about to lapse. I am not able to pay the accommodation fees as I have decided to self-isolate. Can the offer deadline date be extended?



Yes. The ANU respects your decision to complete a 14-day self-isolation period. Please do accept your accommodation offer, and then email your residence and the accommodation service team with supporting documentation, including copies of current and revised travel plans and home address in the Hubei Prefecture or other area of Mainland China. The team will agree with you a new date by which the accommodation fees are payable. My accommodation offer has now lapsed. I was not able to pay the accommodation fees as I decided to self-isolate. Can the offer be reinstated?



Yes. The ANU respects your decision to complete a 14-day self-isolation period. Please do email your residence and the accommodation service team with supporting documentation, including copies of current and revised travel plans and home address in the Hubei Prefecture or other area of Mainland China.

How late can I enrol for semester 1 2020? Semester one 2020 begins 24 February 2020. If you arrive before 10 March, your academic College and School should be able to help you catch up with any missed classes. We will also provide additional orientation activities. If you can't start classes by 10 March, then you might wish to defer your studies for a semester. New students should contact international.admissions@anu.edu.au. Continuing students should email student@anu.edu.au. ANU is committed to supporting affected students so that they can still complete their studies with as minimal disruption as possible.



We are exploring a range of options to do this. These include online courses and teaching, weekend catch up classes and lectures, intensive summer and intensive winter courses and, where appropriate, allowing students to enrol in an increased study load. If I will not be studying in semester one, do I need to drop my courses in ISIS? No. Instead, please contact student@anu.edu.au before 10 March 2020 and we will process your program leave for you. I have paid a deposit of fees and am wondering what I need to do if I won't be there in semester 1? You deposit will be refunded back to you. Alternatively, it can be applied to future study. Please contact student@anu.edu.au for assistance. If you have not yet paid your fees for 2020, your place to start in semester two will be saved for you. You can contact the ANU Helpline on +61 2 6125 3346 (Option 1) or email anustaff.helpline@anu.edu.au for further information.
