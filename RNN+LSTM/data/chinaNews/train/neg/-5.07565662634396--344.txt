Hong Kong, Jan 6 : About 200 people gathered at various locations in Hong Kong on Monday to voice their discontent, a day after police arrested nearly 50 people at a march against mainland Chinese shoppers and parallel traders.

Answering online calls, crowds turned up outside the Revenue Tower in Wan Chai, and on streets in Causeway Bay to chant slogans, while some staged a sit-in at the Kowloon Commerce Centre in Kwai Chung, reports the South China Morning Post newspaper.

About a dozen pro-independent activists joined midway through chanting, "Hong Kong independence, the only way out".

A group of students also took part in the march, with Form Five student David Lee leading the rally at one point.

Monday's protest came a day after a rally in Sheung Shui ended in chaos.

Protesters took to the border town to vent their frustration at parallel traders, both from the mainland and Hong Kong, who buy products in the city and resell them at a higher price across the border.
