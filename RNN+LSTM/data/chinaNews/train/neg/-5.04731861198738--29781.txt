Beijing on Monday reported its first death from the deadly coronavirus that's sweeping China and popping up in countries around the world.China's state-run CCTV said the 50-year-old man recently visited Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, and was confirmed to have the virus last week.The World Health Organization on Monday also said there had been an error in its previous reports, which "incorrectly" said the global risk from the coronavirus was "moderate".The WHO now says the risk is "very high" in China, and "high" at the global level.A spokeswoman for the WHO reassured that the change was only due to "an error" in the wording.The WHO last week fell short of declaring the virus an international public health emergency - a designation only used for the most severe outbreaks.More than 29-hundred people are now said to have been infected by the coronavirus, with the death toll spiking to 82.A nine month-old baby and four year old child in Beijing have also been confirmed to have the coronavirus.About 80 percent of the newly confirmed patients are in their 30s and 40s.Many more countries are reporting confirmed cases as well, including the U.S., Canada and Australia.On Monday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited Wuhan to inspect local efforts to contain the disease.In a bid to restrict further spread of the virus, Wuhan and more than a dozen other Chinese cities remain on lockdown and the Chinese government has extended the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday by three days to February 2nd.Kim Jae-hee, Arirang News.Meanwhile, Germany has confirmed its first case of the coronavirus.A spokesman for the Bavarian health ministry on Monday said the man is from the town of Starnberg, which is 30 kilometers southwest of Munich.We'll have more updates on this in our later newscast.
