In a statement, EF Tours says, “As an example of our commitment to safety, earlier this month we proactively started moving groups that were scheduled to travel to China, even before the U.S. Department of State recommended doing so. In addition, after the increase in new cases reported in northern Italy, we decided to once again proactively reroute groups that were scheduled to travel to or near the quarantined towns and have taken the additional measure to not have overnight stays in Venice or Milan for the next month as we continue to monitor the impact.”
