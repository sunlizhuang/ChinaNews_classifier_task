A person who recently traveled to New York City from China was tested for possible coronavirus at Elmhurst General Hospital — but it turned out to be just a case of the flu, a law enforcement source told The Post

City Health Department spokesman Patrick Gallahue earlier insisted that “there are no suspected cases” of coronavirus in the city.

Before the latest development, there were six confirmed cases of the flu-like illness in the US — the most recent being the first confirmed instance of the virus spreading from person to person in the country.

That patient, announced Thursday, is the husband of an Illinois woman who was diagnosed earlier this month.

By Friday morning, the virus had killed at least 213 people, all of them in China. Almost 9,900 others are infected there, with about 130 cases in 22 other countries.

The World Health Organization has declared the virus a global public health emergency in efforts to get more resources and increase international coordination to combat it.

The State Department also has warned Americans to avoid all travel to China due to the “rapidly spreading” outbreak.
