BEIJING, Feb 2, 2020 (BSS/AFP) – The death toll from China’s coronavirus

epidemic soared to 304 on Sunday, as an increasing number of countries

imposed extraordinary Chinese travel bans to combat the spread of the

disease.

With Britain, Russia and Sweden among the countries confirming their first

infections, the virus has now spread to more than two dozen nations, sending

governments scurrying to limit their exposure.

The United States and Australia are leading a growing list of countries

that are putting temporary but sweeping travel restrictions on Chinese

nationals or those who have travelled to China within the last two weeks.

“Foreign nationals, other than immediate family of US citizens and

permanent residents… will be denied entry into the United States Health

Secretary Alex Azar had announced.

Australia said it was barring entry to non-citizens arriving from China,

while Australian citizens who had travelled there would be required to go

into “self-isolation” for two weeks.

Vietnam suspended all flights from mainland China effective Saturday, while

Russia announced it would halt visa-free tourism for Chinese nationals and

stop issuing them work visas.

Similar expansive restrictions have been announced by countries including

Italy, Singapore, and China’s northern neighbour Mongolia.

The United States, Japan, Britain, Germany and other nations had already

advised their citizens not to travel to China.

Thousands of Hong Kong medical workers voted to commence a four-day strike

from Monday to push the government to close its border with mainland China to

stop the virus, which has already spread to the financial hub.

Britain said Saturday it was temporarily withdrawing some diplomatic staff

and their families from across China, a day after the US State Department

ordered embassy employees to send home family members under the age of 21. –

‘Unkind’ –

Beijing insists it can contain the virus and called Washington’s advice

against travel to China “unkind”.

The US emergency declaration also requires Americans returning from Hubei

province to be placed in mandatory 14-day quarantine, and health screening

for American citizens coming from other parts of China.

The virus emerged in early December and has been traced to a market in

Hubei’s capital Wuhan that sold wild animals.

It spread globally on the wings of a Lunar New Year holiday rush that sees

hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel domestically and overseas.

The economic fallout continued as Apple announced that all its China stores

would be closed until February 9.

China’s central bank said it would offer financial support to businesses

hit by the public health emergency.

– Mea culpa –

With public anger mounting in China, Wuhan’s top official admitted late

Friday that authorities there had acted too slowly.

“If strict control measures had been taken earlier the result would have

been better than now,” said Ma Guoqiang, the Communist Party chief for Wuhan.

Wuhan officials have been criticised online for withholding information

about the outbreak until late December despite knowing of it weeks earlier.

China finally lurched into action last week, effectively quarantining whole

cities in Hubei and tens of millions of people.

Unprecedented safeguards imposed nationwide include postponing the return

to school, cutting bus and train routes, and tightening health screening on

travellers nationwide.

Authorities in Hubei have extended the new year holiday until February 13

and suspended marriage registrations from Monday to discourage public

gatherings.

The city of Huanggang, east of Wuhan, said only one member of each

household would be permitted to leave the house every two days to buy

necessities.

But the toll keeps mounting, with health authorities in Hubei on Sunday

reporting 45 more deaths in the preceding 24 hours.

The number of confirmed infections across China passed 14,300 on Sunday,

the National Health Commission announced — far higher than the Severe Acute

Respiratory Syndrome outbreak of 2002-03.

SARS, which is caused by a pathogen similar to the new coronavirus and also

originated in China, killed 774 people worldwide — most of them in mainland

China and Hong Kong.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global

emergency on Thursday but later warned that closing borders was probably

ineffective in halting transmission and could accelerate the virus’s spread.

But authorities around the world pressed ahead with preventive measures.

– ‘Latent racism’ –

Thai health officials on Friday said a taxi driver became the kingdom’s

first case of human-to-human transmission.

Thailand joins China, Vietnam, Germany, Japan, France and the United States

with confirmed domestic infections.

The health crisis has dented China’s international image and put Chinese

nationals in difficult positions abroad, with complaints of racism.

China flew overseas Hubei residents back to the centre of the outbreak in

Wuhan on chartered planes from Thailand and Malaysia, citing “practical

difficulties” the passengers had encountered overseas.

Countries including Japan, Britain, France and the US have scrambled to

evacuate their nationals from Wuhan, with more governments planning airlifts.
