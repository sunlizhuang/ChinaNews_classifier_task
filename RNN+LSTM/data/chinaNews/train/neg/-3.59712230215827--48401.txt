The Singapore government has rejected the visa applications of all members of the Biman crew who on Sunday brought back 312 Bangladeshis from the Coronavirus-hit Chinese city of Wuhan.

The crew was supposed to fly to Singapore as part of their duty.

Cabinet Secretary Khandaker Anwarul Islam confirmed the matter.

“Singapore has already rejected their visa applications,” he told reporters after a cabinet meeting today.

“A total of 171 more Bangladeshis are still in Wuhan. There is a plan to bring them back. So, a discussion is on with the Chinese government about whether the Bangladeshis can be brought back by a chartered plane of China,” he said.

On the returnees, the secretary said doctors had conducted blood tests on all of them. “None of them was found infected with Coronavirus.”
