A Philippine Airlines (PAL) flight with more than a hundred passengers from Xiamen, China arrived at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) on Monday.

PAL spokesman Cielo Villaluna said the special flight had 124 passengers and eight crew.

She noted that 51 of them had Philippine permanent resident visas.





The plane, an Airbus A321, flew early Monday morning to Xiamen to pick up overseas Filipino workers and passengers with resident visas who were stranded in the Chinese city.

The same plane later took off from NAIA — carrying Chinese tourists bound for Xiamen —to pick up Filipino passengers, as well as Chinese who are holders of Philippine permanent resident visas.

Villaluna said the return flight would not only ferry stranded passengers in Xiamen, but also those stranded in Jinjiang, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Macau who want to return to Manila.

Villaluna clarified that the airline had no passengers from Hubei province, whose capital Wuhan is ground zero for the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease.

The 124 passengers and crew will undergo self-quarantine.
