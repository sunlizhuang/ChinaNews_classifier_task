Pompeo accused by China of slander

TASHKENT • China's embassy in Uzbekistan yesterday accused US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of slander after he raised the plight of Muslims in the Xinjiang region during a visit to Central Asia.

In both Uzbekistan, where Mr Pompeo ended a week-long diplomatic tour on Monday, and Kazakhstan the day before, Mr Pompeo had brought up what he called China's "repression" of Muslims in Xinjiang.

"No matter how many times it is repeated, a lie does not become the truth. Any attempt to slander China and sow discord in friendly relations between China and the states of Central Asia is doomed to defeat," the embassy said in a statement on its website.
