ADOPT A MOON BEAR

The moon bear, also known as the Asiatic bear, can be distinguished by the yellowish white crescent moon on its chest, in contrast to its deep black fur. These expert climbers scale fruit trees to feed and also live on leaves, nuts, berries, insects and small mammals. As a solitary species, moon bears only meet to mate. Females give birth to between one to three cubs who will stay with their mother until the age of two.

Moon bears are found across 18 countries, from Iran to China, in forested regions and open meadows. Classed as Vulnerable on the IUCNâ€™s Red List, surveys of their range point to a 31% decline in numbers over the last 30 years.

Under threat from deforestation, human encroachment and poaching, moon bears also suffer from the abhorrent practice of bear bile farming.
