During this period, people should remain at home and monitor their health closely. They should watch out for symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing.

They should take their temperature twice a day to see if they have a fever. Other early symptoms include chills, body aches, sore throat, headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and runny nose.

If they develop a fever or any of the above-mentioned symptoms, they should call the 1922 hotline provided by Taiwan’s Centers for Disease Control, or contact the local health department immediately.
