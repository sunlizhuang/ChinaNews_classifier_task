City leaders will hold a meeting Friday in Boston’s Chinatown to concerns and misconceptions about the coronavirus.

The Boston Public Health Commission will hold a public meeting 6:30 p.m. at the Josiah Quincy Elementary School.

The meeting will be conducted in both English and Cantonese.

Officials said they're trying to make sure people get the best, most credible information about the outbreak.

There has been one confirmed case of coronavirus in Massachusetts -- a UMass Boston student who had returned from China and is recovering.

Nearly 300 Americans evacuated from the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak are headed back to the U.S., as the death toll in China continues to rise.

Officials on board a cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan confirm 61 people have tested positive for the illness.
