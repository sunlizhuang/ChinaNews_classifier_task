No one will be taking a closer interest in the deepening tensions between Washington and Tehran over the assassination of Quds Force commander Qassim Soleimani than the rulers of Russia and China.

Even before US President Donald Trump authorised the mission to assassinate the iconic Iranian commander, Russia and China have been investing heavily in deepening their ties with the ayatollahs.

As signatories to the controversial 2015 nuclear deal, under which Iran agreed to scale down its nuclear weapons programme in return for the easing of economic sanctions, both Moscow and Beijing have opposed the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the deal, a decision that was taken, in part, in response to Soleimani’s role in expanding Iran’s unwelcome meddling in the affairs of its Arab neighbours.

Moreover, at a time when the US is seen as seeking to scale down its historic involvement in the Middle East, both countries believe there is an opportunity for them to fill the vacuum.
