Colorado health officials say they are testing a third patient in the state for coronavirus.

Those test results — which take several days to come back — are pending at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Those test results are expected late Monday or Tuesday.

The unnamed patient is being treated in metro Denver. It's unclear where exactly the patient is being treated.

Two previous Colorado patients tested negative for the virus. All three patients who were tested showed respiratory symptoms and a history of travel from China.

A release on Monday from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment revealed previously unknown potential infections in a second and third patient.

The first potential patient did travel in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak of a "novel" coronavirus began. Centura-St. Anthony Hospital in Lakewood isolated the patient while they investigated. Officials said Sunday that testing on the patient revealed that they do not have coronavirus.

The second patient tested negative in northern Colorado. Health officials would not provide a specific location citing patient privacy.

The New York Times reports Wuhan officials think around half of the city’s nearly 3,000 suspected cases of coronavirus will eventually test positive for the disease. As of Monday morning, there are 2,744 confirmed cases across China. At least 80 people have died from the virus. A fifth U.S. case has been confirmed.

But Colorado public health officials say the risk to the general public is low for novel coronavirus in Colorado.
