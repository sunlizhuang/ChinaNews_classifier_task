SOFIA, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- A roundtable discussion on the achievements and challenges of Chinese language teaching in Bulgaria was held here on Friday.

More than 80 representatives of universities and schools from 12 Bulgarian cities, including six of the eight largest cities in the country -- Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna, Ruse, Stara Zagora and Sliven -- participated in the event.

"China and Bulgaria have a long history of educational exchange and cooperation, which is an important part of the development of the bilateral relations," said Chinese Ambassador to Bulgaria Dong Xiaojun at the opening ceremony.

According the Dong, four Bulgarian universities are currently offering courses on Chinese language and culture, while four Chinese universities are providing courses on Bulgarian language and culture, both contributing to bilateral cooperation.

Meanwhile, an increasing number of Bulgarian schools now offer Chinese language courses, and Beijing high school students could choose to learn Bulgarian, "which will undoubtedly lay a stronger foundation for the development of friendly relations between the two countries," he said.

Prof. Anastas Gerdjikov, rector of the Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski, said that in recent years, the interest in learning Chinese language and culture has increased significantly.

This was mainly due to China's economic development, as well as the policies of the Chinese government, he said.
