London: Prince Harry and Meghan have no intention of putting their names to products such as milk or perfume as they embark on their new careers, according to the London Telegraph.

In a marked contrast to relatives such as Peter Phillips, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex insist they will not use their royal heritage to sell anything in the commercial marketplace.

A friend said: "They could not have been more clear, they will never sell milk or anything like that. The idea that they will put their names to products in that way is wide of the mark. It completely misinterprets what they want to do."

Royal sources confirmed that the couple were planning to pursue careers in television, investigating executive producer roles such as that taken by Prince Harry, 35, on the forthcoming mental health series he has co-created with Oprah Winfrey, the chat show star, for Apple television.
