The Mate Xs is a successor to the Mate X – the foldable phone Huawei launched at MWC last year

The cancellation of MWC didn’t stop Huawei from going ahead with a hardware event today. Instead of heading to Barcelona the firm revealed all via a live stream from China and there's plenty to talk about. During proceedings, the Shenzhen tech firm showed off a new smart speaker, flagship laptop and tablet – but by far the most exciting announcement was for its next foldable phone, the Mate Xs.

The Mate Xs is a direct successor to the Mate X – the foldable phone Huawei launched at MWC last year. At first glance, you’d be forgiven for thinking the Xs isn’t different at all – it boasts the same wrap-around design, screen size and quad-camera system as its predecessor.

Instead of focusing on flashy upgrades to generate feverish excitement amongst its fans, Huawei is improving the Mate Xs where it matters. The tech giant is beefing up the Mate Xs’ screen and hinge in an attempt to make the device more durable.

Unlike Samsung’s shiny new Galaxy Z Flip, the Mate Xs still comes with a display that’s made entirely of plastic. That said, Huawei has said it has added an extra layer to the handset’s display that should make it tougher overall.
