NAY PYI TAW, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- A photo exhibition in commemoration of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Myanmar opened here Friday, bringing visitors back to historical moments of the two neighboring countries during the past 70 years.

A total of 46 precious photos were on display with captions in both Chinese and Myanmar languages in the Myanmar International Convention Center 2.

The exhibition consists of three parts, namely high-level visits, economic and trade ties, and people-to-people exchanges. It reviews the friendly relations between China and Myanmar, shows mutually beneficial cooperation, and tells the stories about China-Myanmar "Paukphaw" (fraternal) friendship.

One of the pictures shows the first flight between the two countries arrived at Yangon airport in 1956. U Yin Htwe, an official from the Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population, said he had not known the two countries launched the first flight more than 60 years ago until he saw the picture.

As more and more Chinese visited Myanmar, U Yin Htwe said he looks forward to closer people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.

U Aung Phyo Myat, Nay Pyi Taw regional director of the Myanmar Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, said he believes the friendship between the two countries will be handed down from one generation to another.

The exhibition was held by the Chinese State Council Information Office and the Myanmar Ministry of Information and organized by China Image Group of Xinhua News Agency and the Myanmar International Convention Center 2.
