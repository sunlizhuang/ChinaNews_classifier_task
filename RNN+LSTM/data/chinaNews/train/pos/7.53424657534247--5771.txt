Head over to Camp Washington's The Welcome Project for an opening exhibition from featured artist Keer Xu. With a focus on printmaking, watercolor and drawing, Xu highlights relationships between human beings, technology and nature and interprets Chinese philosophical traditions of humanity’s fundamental harmony with nature “in a creepy and cute way.”

Get an extra dose of art at the opening reception of Wave Pool's Sentiments of Here, as curated by the gallery's current curator-in-residence, Sso-Rha Kang. Artists Snow Yu, Mark Albain and Intermedio will "explore intimate encounters through a considerate study of the everyday" through sound, video and a photographic installation that focuses on "subtle sensory experiences inspired by the banalities of the Midwest."

6 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 11. Free. The Welcome Project, 2936 Colerain Ave., Camp Washington, welcomecincinnati.org; 6 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 11. Free. Wave Pool, 2940 Colerain Ave, Camp Washington, wavepoolgallery.org.

*UPDATE: A previous version of this article stated that there would be a "Second Saturday" art walk event on Jan. 11; the two above exhibition openings at Wave Pool and The Welcome Project are the only happenings.
