HOUSTON, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- A photo exhibition featuring the development of China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was held Thursday night in Chinese Consulate General in Houston.

The exhibition, named "Human Rights in Xinjiang - Development and Progress," consisted of more than 80 pictures taken in Xinjiang, showing its political, economic and social development. The exhibition was part of the activities of the Chinese Lunar New Year reception held in the consulate general with around 500 attendees.

Chinese Consul General Cai Wei told Xinhua that this was a good opportunity to introduce and promote Xinjiang to American people, "especially to show them the recent and real development of that area."

"I've talked to some guests, both Americans and Chinese. They were so interested in and amazed by the advanced infrastructure in Xinjiang and how ethnic groups live together in harmony," Cai said, adding that more photo exhibitions will be organized to better show China to Americans.

Celebrating the upcoming Chinese Lunar New Year, which will begin on Jan. 25 this year, the reception was attended by representatives from various local groups and overseas Chinese. The hall of the consulate general was decorated with red balloons and Chinese knots, showing festive atmosphere to all the guests. Traditional Chinese dishes were also prepared.
