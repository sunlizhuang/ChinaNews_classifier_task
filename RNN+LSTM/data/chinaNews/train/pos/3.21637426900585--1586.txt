Galacto Oligosaccharides (GOS) also referred as oligogalactose are non-digestible food ingredients, which enhance host health by selectively stimulating activity or growth of one or limited number of bacteria in colon. They are manufactured through enzymatic conversion of lactose and contain short chains of galactose molecules. Galacto Oligosaccharides promote growth of good bacteria in small intestine and keep bad bacteria such as E. Coli away from the intestine walls.

They do this by mimicking intestinal walls appearance, so that unfriendly bacteria gets attached to them instead of intestinal walls and are then flushed away through the intestinal tract. These ingredients also assist in better absorption of certain minerals including calcium and thus its supplementation help in preventing osteoporosis. GOS and good bacteria together play a significant role in reducing the number of allergic reactions in human body, preventing urinary & vaginal infections, alleviating dermatitis & other skin conditions, and assisting in maintaining integrity of intestinal tract. GOS also assists in regulating bowel movements and provides relief from constipation.

Growth in infant population and increase in health consciousness among consumers are primary factors that drive the galacto oligosaccharides market across the globe. Upsurge in demand of functional foods and product innovation are other factors, which supplement the market growth. Asia-Pacific is expected to register substantial growth due to growth in population and rise in disposable incomes in emerging economies such as China and India. Increase in competition of substitutes such as Isomaltooligosaccharide (IMO) and lack of awareness among consumers regarding benefits of galacto oligosaccharide hinder the market growth. However, continuous innovation in terms of production techniques is projected to provide potential growth opportunities for market expansion.
