PIERRE, S.D. —South Dakota’s congressional delegation applauded an agreement that was reached with China to purchase $200 billion in products and services over the next two years, with $40 billion per year committed to the purchase of agriculture products.

Gov. Kristi Noem, accompanied by Jerry Schmitz, a soybean producer from Vermillion, and Craig Andersen, a pork producer from Centerville, attended the signing ceremony in Washington on Wednesday, Jan. 15.

Schmitz, who is also the executive director of the South Dakota Soybean Association, said the progress in trade negotiations with China is exciting in a news release.

“The pioneer spirit of our ancestors remains strong among farmers. We are constantly seeking new opportunities that lie just over the horizon,” Schmitz stated in the release.

Andersen, in addition to running a diversified family farm consisting of row crops, feeder pigs and cattle, serves as first vice president for the South Dakota Pork Producers Council.

U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson said in a release that the agreement is a “step in the right direction."

“Producers want certainty and China needs to play fair — this agreement hits the mark on both fronts. This China agreement paired with the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) are the wins our producers need.”

U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds said the agreement provides much-needed relief for the state’s farmers and ranchers “who have been the tip of the spear throughout trade negotiations by reestablishing markets for them to sell their products,” according to a released statement.
