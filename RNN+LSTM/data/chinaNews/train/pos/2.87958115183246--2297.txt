KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 8: Malaysia-China relations will see another leap this year based on all the positive indicators, says Chinese ambassador to Malaysia Bai Tian.

One major positive news for Malaysia is that Beijing will be participating in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) Summit and Forum this year.

“Our top leaders have indicated that they will attend the Apec 2020 meeting later this year and we will give strong support to Malaysia in hosting the event.

“This is a very important international event. We have successfully organised one in China and will render our contributions to the Apec meeting here, ” he told several media organisations in a press conference on Monday.

Apec reportedly represents 60% of the world’s gross domestic product, valued at US$48 trillion, and 47% of the global trade, worth US$22 trillion.
