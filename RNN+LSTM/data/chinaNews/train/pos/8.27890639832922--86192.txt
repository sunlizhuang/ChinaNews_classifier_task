BEIJING, Feb. 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientist Xue Qikun has won the 2020 Fritz London Prize, an international award to recognize scientists who made outstanding contributions in the field of low-temperature physics, according to the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.

Xue, head of Beijing Academy of Quantum Information Sciences, won the award for pioneering contributions to the experimental discovery of quantum anomalous Hall effect, which will help accelerate the development of low-power-consumption electronics.

The prize, awarded every three years, is recognized as the highest honor in the field of low-temperature physics in the world. Since its establishment in 1957, more than 50 famous physicists have been awarded the prize and Xue is the first Chinese scientist to receive the honor, according to the commission, funded by the Beijing municipal government.

Xue is also an academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and vice president of the prestigious Tsinghua University. His research team won China's State Natural Science Award in 2019 for quantum discovery.

He is known as the "7-11 professor" because in his early years studying abroad, he was often seen entering the laboratory at 7 a.m. and coming out at 11 p.m.

The award ceremony of 2020 Fritz London Prize will be held during the 29th International Conference on Low-Temperature Physics in Japan from Aug. 15 to 22, said the commission.
