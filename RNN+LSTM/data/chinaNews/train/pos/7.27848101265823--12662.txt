China will continue deepening bilateral relations with Zimbabwe as the two countries celebrate four decades of diplomatic relations, Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe Guo Shaochun said on Thursday.

Speaking at a reception held in Harare to mark the beginning of the Chinese Lunar New Year, Guo expressed optimism that four decades of diplomatic relations between the two sides will lay the foundation for an even more brilliant future.

"The year 2020 is a milestone in the history of Zimbabwe and in our bilateral relations; as Zimbabwe celebrates its 40 years of independence, its diplomatic relationship with China will also mark its 40th anniversary. This is not a historical coincidence, but a testament to our special bond which was made official on the very same day of Zimbabwe's independence," he said.

He said both sides should continue supporting one another in order to tackle common challenges and to embrace a brighter future.

"Looking ahead, we must further upgrade our practical cooperation to boost our economic ties so that they match our high-level political trust. Today, both the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and the Belt and Road initiative are two major platforms for us to deepen cooperation."

He said in the process of striving for national independence and safeguarding national sovereignty, China has always given firm support to Zimbabwe.

"Forty years of history of China-Zimbabwe diplomatic relations offer us valuable experience," he said.

Speaking at the same occasion, Chief Director in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade of Zimbabwe Lovemore Mazemo expressed gratitude to the Chinese for their unwavering support to Zimbabwe's developmental needs.

He said the two sides should continue deepening political mutual trust and enhance their level of cooperation.
