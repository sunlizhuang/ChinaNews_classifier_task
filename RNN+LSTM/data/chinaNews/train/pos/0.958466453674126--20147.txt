Shanghai (Gasgoo)- About 5,000 hydrogen FCVs (fuel cell vehicle) are expected to be offered in 2020 in China, with the total number likely to reach 10,000 units by the end of the year, according to statistics provided by a reporter from the Shanghai Securities News on the basis of some local governments' plans for FCV.

Besides, the three major cost problems of hydrogen production, storage and transportation are likely to be gradually solved amid the issue of the new energy vehicle (NEV) industry development plan (2021-2035) and the upcoming national hydrogen FCV scheme. According to the FCV plan of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), the region plans to build more than 40 hydrogen filling stations by 2021, 200 by 2025 and 500 by 2030. The FCV parc is set to reach 5,000 units by 2021, 50,000 units by 2025 and 200,000 units by 2030 in the area.

Shanghai, the core city in the YRD FCV plan, intends to operate 20,000 hydrogen FCVs and construct 50 refueling stations by 2025, while Wuhan, proposes to make 30-100 stations and have 10,000-30,000 hydrogen FCVs operated by 2025. By 2020, the capital of Hubei province sets out to build 5-20 stations and see demonstration operation of 2,000-3,000 FCVs. At present, the two cities target most FCV population.

By the end of 2020, if Shanghai, Wuhan, Suzhou (800 units), Shanxi (700 units) and other governments can meet their targets, the total number of hydrogen FCVs in operation in China will double from nearly 5,000 units at the end of 2019.

According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, the sales of hydrogen FCV from 2016 to 2019 totaled 6,168 units, with 2,737 units sold in 2019, 1,527 units in 2018, 1,275 units in 2017 and 629 units in 2016 (photo source: Sinopecnews.com).
