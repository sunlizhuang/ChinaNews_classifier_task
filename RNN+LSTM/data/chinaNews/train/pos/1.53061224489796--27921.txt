In partnership with The Canton Repository, every week the Stark Community Foundation is highlighting positive happenings in our community. Here's to a Good News Monday!

• As a way to promote and position the Akron-Canton area as one destination, the Akron-Canton Airport, Akron/Summit Convention & Visitors Bureau and Visit Canton joined forces to renovate the airport’s Visitor Information Center. The center opened Wednesday and showcases to travelers everything Northeast Ohio has to offer.

• Congratulations to University of Mount Union’s AJ Digby for being named to the 2020 U.S. Paralympics Track and Field National Team!

• Starting next month, SARTA will offer new express routes in western Stark County and around Akron-Canton Airport to help employees get to work for early morning shifts.
