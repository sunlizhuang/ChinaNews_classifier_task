In her remarks, VUFO President Nguyen Phuong Nga reviewed the 70-year history and the tremendous achievements of the relationship, which she attributed to contributions of generations of Vietnamese and Chinese leaders and people.



She underscored the responsibility of both sides to preserve and promote these achievements while emphasizing that the promotion of cooperation between the two Parties, States and peoples, and the maintenance the Vietnam-China relationship in a healthy and stable way, is an important factor to peace, stability and development of each nation as well as of the region and the world as a whole, given the complex development of regional and international situation.



The Vietnamese Party, State and people always place importance on developing the all-around strategic cooperative partnership between Vietnam and China, considering this a top priority in Vietnam’s external policy, she said.

Nga highlighted the role of people-to-people exchange in materializing common perception reached by high-ranking leaders, enhancing mutual understanding and trust, and consolidating the social foundation for the development of the Vietnam-China relationship.

The official voiced her hope for closer coordination with Chinese partners in holding people-to-people exchanges to mark the 70th anniversary of the diplomatic ties.



Chinese Ambassador Xiong Bo applauded the contributions of the VUFO and the VCFA to deepening mutual understanding and friendship between the two countries.



The ambassador echoed Nga’s view on closer coordination in organising friendship activities to mark 70 years of the bilateral diplomatic ties, such as the China-Vietnam People’s Forum and the China-Vietnam Youth Friendship Meeting.



He affirmed the Chinese Embassy’s readiness to step up cooperation with the VUFO and the VCFA as a contribution to strengthening understanding and friendship between Vietnamese and Chinese people, and the relationship between the two countries in a stable, healthy and sustainable fashion.
