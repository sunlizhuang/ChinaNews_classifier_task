Our unemployment figures are at historic lows and our economic growth is steady –although at a relatively low level. These trends started under the Obama Administration, whose policies helped bring us out of a ruinous recession. But the truth is that millions of American families have not fully recovered from the effects of the recession, and the ongoing recovery has not abated the growing income inequality that has plagued our economy for years. This problem was exacerbated by the Trump tax law, which provided an overwhelming percentage of its benefits to the very wealthy and to large corporations that bought back stock and paid big dividends rather than investing in new plants and new jobs. It was recently reported that corporations in the U.S. are paying an average rate of 11 percent in taxes – far below the rate paid by most individual taxpayers. Dozens of highly profitable corporations are paying no federal tax at all. Meanwhile, thousands of middle-class families in my district and across the country are paying higher taxes because their State and Local Tax Deductions (SALT) were capped under the Trump tax law. This is wrong and unfair. I cosponsored bipartisan legislation to fully restore the State and Local Tax Deduction, which passed the House late last year. The Senate should follow suit.
