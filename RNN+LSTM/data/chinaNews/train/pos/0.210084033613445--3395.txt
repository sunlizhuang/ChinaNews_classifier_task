The government asked Legco to bypass its normal procedures amid a logjam of bills backed up by a paralyzed committee – to pass legislation to extend maternity leave from 10 to 14 weeks, RTHK reports.

The bill had passed its second reading in Legco yesterday, and would usually next be sent to Legco’s agenda-setting House Committee, which typically sets up a new committee dedicated to scrutinizing the bill.

However, amid partisan bickering between the pro-government and pan-democratic camps, the House Committee has for months failed to even elect a chairperson, meaning it cannot perform its usual duties.

The pro-Beijing Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) had asked Legco President Andrew Leung to skip this step altogether, and to send the bill directly back to the full council for a vote, but Leung rejected this request today, citing a lack of precedent.

In a highly unusual move, the Secretary for Welfare and Labour, Law Chi-kwong, then proposed that the council’s existing Panel on Manpower can vet the legislation instead. Leung is now considering the new request.

The FTU’s Alice Mak supported Law's move, saying this is the only choice under the circumstances.

“We can see no ending in the prolonged filibustering in our House Committee,” she said. “We do not know when we can form a bills committee for this very important bill, so we would rather use any possible measures to pass this bill.”

Her partymate Ho Kai-ming urged his political rivals to put aside their political differences to focus on the welfare of pregnant women.
