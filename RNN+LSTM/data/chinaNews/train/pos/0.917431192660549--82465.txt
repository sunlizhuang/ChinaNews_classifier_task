China's Hainan Airlines will resume more than 450 flights starting Saturday amid the epidemic, to aid the work resumption of enterprises across the country.

Tickets for the flights departing from domestic cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hangzhou have been on sale.

The airline has launched charter flight services for government and enterprise customers since Wednesday to fully support the work and production resumption all over the country.

Flight HU7827 carried more than 130 employees of a company from Nanning in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to Guangzhou in Guangdong Province Friday evening, which was the airlines' first charter flight for work resumption.
