The Toyota HiAce is the workhorse's workhorse, and it's enjoyed an unprecedented run of success over the last two decades as the tradie's tool of choice.

Simple, rugged and dependable, there's nothing fancy about the big box on wheels. The dependable four-cylinder petrol engine is mounted underneath the passenger compartment to maximise available load space, and it can take a pallet of freight with ease. Its dominance has been challenged in recent years, though, by vans from Hyundai and Ford, while Chinese brands like Haval are also doing their best to unseat the HiAce from its lofty perch.

Current prices range from $38,640 for the HiAce LWB to $70,140 for the HiAce COMMUTER GL (12 SEATS).
