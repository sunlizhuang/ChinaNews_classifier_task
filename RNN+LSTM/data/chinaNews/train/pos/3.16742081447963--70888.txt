The Canton City School District is expanding its dinner program to allow any child under the age of 18 to eat a free hot meal.

CANTON Beginning Tuesday, children can go to Hartford Middle School to eat a free hot dinner — even if they don’t attend that school.

The Canton City School District is opening its dinner program to the community. Meals will be served from 5-6 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays at the middle school at 1824 Third St. SE.

The only requirement to receive a meal is that the child must be under the age of 18, according to the district.

The district in November began serving dinner to students who attend after-school programs at Crenshaw, Hartford and Lehman middle schools and at the downtown and main McKinley High School campuses. The district, which already serves students free breakfast and lunch, plans to continue expanding its free dinner service as resources become available. It also plans to operate a food truck this summer that will make various stops in the community to serve children free food.

The dinner service is being funded through a federal program that provides reimbursements for nutritious meals given to at-risk children and money from the district’s cafeteria fund that cannot be used on other expenses.
