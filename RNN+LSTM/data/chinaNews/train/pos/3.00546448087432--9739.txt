Politburo member and permanent member of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) Central Committee’s Secretariat Tran Quoc Vuong made the remarks at a reception in Hanoi on January 14 for a delegation of the Communist Party of China (CPC) led by Director of the CPC Central Committee’s International Liaison Department Song Tao.

Vuong told the guests that amid profound and unpredictable changes in the world and the region as well as continued reforms in both Vietnam and China, besides advantages, the two nations have been facing a lot of challenges.

He suggested ministries, sectors and localities of Vietnam and China step up practical and effective cooperation in all spheres as the two nations are celebrating the 70th founding anniversary of diplomatic ties this year.

Regarding differences, Vuong stressed that, based on the common perceptions of high-ranking leaders of the two Parties and States, the two sides should join hands to find out satisfactory solutions, properly settle disagreements through peaceful measures, and comply with international law.

For his part, Song affirmed that the Party, Government and people of China always attach importance to developing the traditional and friendly neighbourliness with Vietnam and stand ready to join hands with their Vietnamese counterparts to implement the common perceptions of senior leaders of the two Parties and States and signed documents, thus developing the bilateral comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership both intensively and extensively and bringing practical benefits to the people of the two nations.

He voiced his hope that the two sides would continue deploying exchange activities through Party, State and people channels in 2020, thereby strengthening the firm foundation for relations between the two Parties, States and people of China and Vietnam.

The same day, Chairman of the CPV Central Committee’s Commission for External Relations Hoang Binh Quan held talks with Song Tao, during which the two sides exchanged views on relations between the two Parties, States and cooperation activities in the recent past.

They also discussed plans to boost cooperative ties and exchanges between the CPV and CPC, between the CPV Central Committee’s Commission for External Relations and the CPC Central Committee’s International Liaison Department and between public organisations in 2020.
