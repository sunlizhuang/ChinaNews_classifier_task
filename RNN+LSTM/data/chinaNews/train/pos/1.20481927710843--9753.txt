Chinese President Xi Jinping is set to visit Myanmar late next week to discuss bilateral relations and push for a quicker rollout of Chinese development projects under the Belt & Road Initiative (BRI). Neither the Myanmar nor Chinese government has released details of Xi’s two-day trip, which will be his first visit to the Southeast Asian country since 2009. The BRI is China’s signature policy to expand cooperation to boost infrastructure development across Asia, Africa and Europe.
