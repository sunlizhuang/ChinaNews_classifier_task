Russian Railways gets 65% discount on coal transit via Kazakhstan

MOSCOW, Jan 31 (PRIME) -- Russian Railways has agreed with Kazakhstan on a 65% discount on Russian coal transit to China, Deputy CEO Alexei Shilo said at a briefing on Friday.

“Since we cannot move from Kuzbass to the East via Mariinsk–Mezhdurechensk with the amount that the cargo consignors want, we offered: let’s see how to go to Kazakhstan and to China via the Kazakhstan’s border crossings across Dostyk–Altynkol,” Shilo said.

“We have completed the work. Our Kazakh colleagues gave a 65% discount on the transit of coal from Russia to China.”

Coal industry representatives earlier complained about repairs and a limited capacity of the railway.

Shilo said that the discount will be provided from February.

Shilo also said that Russian Railways can give discounts of up to 12.8% on exports of Russian energy coal to the northwestern and Azov and Black Sea ports from March.
