Xiaomi's Mi Home app allows users to instantly manage their personal smart home ecosystem

Dubai-based developer Emaar Properties has partnered with Chinese giant Xiaomi to launch ‘Emaar Smart Home’, described as a next-generation product offering the latest smart home technology powered by artificial intelligence.

The companies have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU), which will see the product launched this year at an exclusive set of digitally-enabled residential developments, powered by Xiaomi, which has the world’s largest Internet of Things (IoT) consumer platform.

Emaar is the first developer outside China to enter into a strategic partnership with Xiaomi.

Chairman of Emaar, Mohamed Alabbar, said: “Emaar Smart Home is a testament to the commitment Emaar and Xiaomi share for creating advanced living experiences. Together, our partnership delivers a novel product never-before-seen in the region, offering connectivity, comfort and convenience for the customers of tomorrow, today.”

Emaar Smart Home will be controlled and monitored through Xiaomi's Mi Home app. The app, along with products that support smart voice assistant controls, allows users to instantly manage their personal smart home ecosystem.

Emaar said Xiaomi’s Mi Smart Door Lock provides security and convenience through keyless entry into the home using smartphones, wearables, and passcodes. Within the home, the Xiaomi Robot Vacuum can be scheduled to provide daily hands-free cleaning.

Chew Shou Zi, senior vice president, president of international at Xiaomi, added: “With Emaar as our partner, we are confident that we will showcase just how advanced the latest Xiaomi smart home products are.”

Emaar Smart Home is to be rolled out across the MENA region.
