What’s the worst studio you ever had?

It was during a yearlong residency in Italy. I was not allowed to hang anything on the walls because it was a historic Tadao Ando-designed building. The architecture was amazing, but it was the most counterproductive space I’ve ever had. I just couldn’t make it my own. I was allowed to be there and breathe it, but nothing else. Otherwise, I can be resourceful and turn anything into a studio.

What’s the first work you ever sold? For how much?

I sold a portrait of a boy that I had photographed in Cape Town. His name was Tam Vleksi, and he had albinism. I sold it for $150 in 2003.

When you start a new piece, where do you begin?

I start when I have an intuitive response to something that piques my interest. If I have the conviction that it’s worth pursuing, I pack my bags and go to make the work. This often results out of a response to something I see on the media, which could be a newspaper article or something from a literary journal, anything that has visual stimuli. It’s about having my eyes open — there is no formula for when that spark may find me. I cultivate a receptive eye.

How do you know when you’re done?

I’m usually done when I’m three-quarters of the way through a project, when I realize that I have started seeing the world in a different way. There’s still the labor part and finishing the work, but mentally and spiritually, I’m finished when I start looking at the world in a different way.
