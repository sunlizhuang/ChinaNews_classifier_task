February 19 (BTA) - Prime Minister Boyko Borissov on

Wednesday conferred with Pau Roca, Director General of the

International Organization of Wine and Vine (OIV), the

government information service said. In Borissov's presence

Agriculture Minister Dessislava Taneva and Roca signed a

memorandum of understanding under which the vine and wine

industry in Bulgaria and the Balkans will be promoted at an

international level.



Borissov and Roca noted the development of vine-growing and

wine-making in Bulgaria which is confirmed by data that 61 per

cent of all vineyards in the country have been entered in the

European Register of Protected Designation of Origin and

Protected Geographical Indications. Bulgaria has a little over

of 60,000 hectares of vineyards. Some have been planted under

the measure for vineyard restructuring and conversion.



In 2019, nearly 850 hectares of vines were planted. There is an

increase in the export of Bulgarian wines in 2019. Bulgaria

exported 64 million litres of wine to Western Europe, China, the

US and the number of wine makers is growing.



The memorandum aims to enhance relations in viticulture,

wine-making, technology, marketing and other areas of mutual

interest. The two sides will also partner in the application of

new technologies, training of specialists and the organization

of conferences, seminars and regular meetings for exchange of

experience and the future trends for the development of the

sector. RI/PP
