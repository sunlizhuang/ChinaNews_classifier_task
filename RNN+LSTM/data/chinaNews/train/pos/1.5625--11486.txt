Three Chinese companies have been chosen to build an international airport for Phnom Penh, according to Cambodia Airport Investment, the company in charge of its construction.

The $1.5bn airport, to be located in Kandal province to the south of the capital, was approved by the government of Cambodia on Friday.

Yee Con Long, a member of the project’s steering committee, said the three, which he did not name, had been chosen from a shortlist of five, and that permits would be issued to them by 20 January.

He said: “We hope to issue a letter in July authorising the construction. If all goes as planned, the airport will be ready by July 2022, at which point it will operate on a trial basis,” he said.

He added that design work in the airport was 60% complete.

Cambodia Airport Investment is a joint-venture between the Oversea Cambodia Investment Corporation (OCIC), a conglomerate owned by businessman Oknha Pung Kheav, and the government’s State Secretariat of Civil Aviation.

Some $1.1bn of the project cost will come from loans from foreign banks and $280m from the Oversea Cambodia Investment Corporation.

OCIC signed a deal on financing with the China Development Bank on Thursday. The ceremony was held at the Peace Palace in Phnom Penh, where 18 other agreements and memorandums of understanding between Cambodia and China were also signed.

Located in Takhmao town and Kandal Stung district, the airport will cover more than 2,600ha and will have a capacity of 27 million by 2030.
