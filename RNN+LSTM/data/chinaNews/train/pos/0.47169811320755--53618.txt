Beijing on Wednesday reiterated support to Taiwan compatriots living on the Chinese mainland, at a time when the confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus (2019-NoV) in the island have reached a total of 11.

Currently, three Taiwan compatriots living on the Chinese mainland have been confirmed with the virus, and all are being well taken care of at local hospitals, according to Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesperson for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office.

Ma stressed that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has put people's health and safety on the number one position, and that, of course, includes those of Taiwan compatriots.

Several Taiwan offices at local levels have actively reached out to Taiwan people or organizations in their regions, Ma said, adding that many are doing "one-on-one" services to ensure the effectiveness of virus prevention work.

In addition, efforts have also been made for those Taiwan compatriots stranded in Hubei Province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. On Monday, 246 Taiwan people managed to get back, Ma added.

The spokesman further vowed latest cases update with Taiwan. "We will invite more experts from Taiwan to Wuhan, Hubei Province and conduct on-the-ground research."
