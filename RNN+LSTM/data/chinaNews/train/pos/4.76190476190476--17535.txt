Black Rock Mining signs EPC framework agreement for Tanzanian graphite project

Black Rock Mining Ltd (ASX:BKT) has signed a framework agreement with a large Chinese infrastructure contractor outlining key terms to progress to a binding Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract for Mahenge Graphite Project in Tanzania.

The non-binding Cooperation Framework Agreement (CFA) with China Railway Seventh Group Co Ltd (CRSG) is aimed at advancing to an EPC contract for the module one process plant and non-process infrastructure (NPI) at Mahenge.



Coordinated EPC approach

It provides for a coordinated EPC approach between CRSG and Yantai Jinyuan, Black Rock's existing strategic build partner.

The CFA also provides for the development of a conventional EPC arrangement containing customary performance warranties and typical risk allocation structures such as guarantees and bonding that are required by project financiers.
