TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) asks for Chinese investors to not only invest their capital in Indonesia. BKPM chief Bahlil Lahadalia said that they also want them to list their shares at the Indonesia Stock Exchange or IDX.

"This will be a good form of synergy," Bahlil said when delivering his remarks at a business forum with Chinese entrepreneurs at IDX's Main Hall in Jakarta, Wednesday, January 8.

Bahlil said that China is currently the sixth largest country to have realized their companies' investments in Indonesia. As of November 2019, China's investors have invested US$2.3 billion, which accounts for 16.2 percent of the total foreign investment entering Indonesia.

Coordinating Minister for Maritime and Investment Affairs Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan said China is committed to work on a number of large projects with the Indonesian government. One project that will be actualized soon is the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railroad project, with the land acquisition progress reaching nearly 100 percent.

In the future, he hopes that Indonesia will accommodate more capital injections from China. Specifically, he said, in the field of technological transformation.
