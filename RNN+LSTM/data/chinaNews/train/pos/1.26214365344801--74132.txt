New Delhi/Beijing, Feb 17 (IANS) India will send a consignment of medical supplies on a relief flight to Wuhan later this week to support China in its fight against the COVID-19 epidemic.

The Indian embassy in Beijing tweeted, “On its return, the flight will have limited capacity to take on board Indians wishing to return” to India from Wuhan in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak.

Ambassador Vikram Misri, however added that “subject to capacity limitations and space availability on the incoming aircraft, India is also willing to facilitate nationals from all our neighbours boarding it on its return journey to New Delhi.” He has asked those interested to contact the embassy.

Many Indian nationals currently in Hubei, who wish to return to India, have already been in touch with the embassy in the last two weeks.

Recently, two Air India flights brought 643 Indians and seven Malaysians from Wuhan.
