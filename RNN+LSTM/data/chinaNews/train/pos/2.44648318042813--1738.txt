Stena Line’s new ferry is expected to enter commercial service next week but the hunt is on for a ‘god parent’ after Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar turned down the invitation.

Stena Estrid arrived in Holyhead just before Christmas after a 10,000 mile voyage from a shipyard in China.

It is now awaiting all its regulatory approvals from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency but ferry bosses hope it will launch its first commercial sailing from Holyhead to Dublin on Monday.

At 215 metres in length, Stena Estrid will provide freight capacity of 3,100 lane meters, meaning a 50 per cent increase in freight tonnage, and the space to carry 120 cars and 1,000 passengers and crew.

But Stena bosses do still need to find a ‘godmother’ or ‘godfather’ for the ship.

It’s a longstanding naval tradition for new ships to be sponsored by a civilian - typically a woman. They are selected to bring good luck and protection to the vessel.

An offer was made in a letter to the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his partner Matt Barrett ahead of the launch next week.

But Stena say this was not accepted on this occasion although they remain hopeful it could happen with a future vessel.

The ferry firm is due to offer the honour to another person in the coming weeks.

Stena Estrid is the first of five new Stena Line next-generation RoPax vessels that are being constructed at the AVIC Weihai Shipyard in China.

Sister ship Stena Edda is due to commence operations from Belfast to Liverpool in spring 2020, with the third vessel Stena Embla expected to be introduced on the same route in early 2021.

Irish Ferries introduced their latest ship - the W B Yeats - on the busy Holyhead to Dublin route last year.
