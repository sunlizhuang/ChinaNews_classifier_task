A detachment of the People's Armed Police in southwest China's Chongqing municipality recently decorated their barracks with lanterns, spring couplets, and paper-cuttings to celebrate the approaching Chinese New Year.

Zhang Shunli, head of political work of the detachment, explained that the soldiers come from different parts of the country, and some are from as far as 1,000 kilometers away. While families across the country get together for Chinese New Year, the soldiers will still be guarding the people and contributing to the stability and prosperity of society.
