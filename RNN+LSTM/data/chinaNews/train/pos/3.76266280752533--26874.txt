About Scripps Research/Shenzhen Bay Laboratory Chemical Biology Institute; Shenzhen, China

Scripps Research is joining forces with Shenzhen Bay Laboratory to establish a joint Chemical Biology Institute (see announcements at: https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2019/20191127-szbl-collaboration.html and https://www.szbl.ac.cn/news_detail_en.aspx?detail=19746&parm=948). Within this institute, the Division of Translational Research will consist of preclinical drug discovery and early drug development expertise and capabilities for small molecules, peptides/proteins and antibodies. Our state of the art facilities will include high throughput screening (HTS) and diverse small molecule libraries (1 million), with capabilities for medicinal chemistry optimization, peptide/protein and antibody engineering, PK and in vivo efficacy studies. Researchers will work closely with scientists from Calibr at Scripps Research, as well as collaborators within the Shenzhen Bay Laboratory and other institutions, to translate biomedical basic discoveries into innovative new drugs that will impact the major diseases of unmet need.

JOB SUMMARY

We are seeking talented PI/Director level managers in Disease Biology, Medicinal Chemistry, in vivo Pharmacology, Peptide, Protein and Antibody engineering to lead a dynamic, interdisciplinary team of research associates and post-doctoral scientists as well as coordinate CRO efforts to develop new therapeutic approaches to unmet medical needs through early stage translational research. Partnerships with various for-profit and non-profit organizations will be a key component of the workflow, and work will be published in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals.
