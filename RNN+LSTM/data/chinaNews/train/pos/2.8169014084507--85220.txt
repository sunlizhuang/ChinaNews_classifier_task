If you’re a photographer who’s tired of carrying dongles around for your newer MacBook Pro, the Kolude KD-K1 Keyhub is an unusual new keyboard that could help ease your pain. It’s essentially a keyboard and USB hub in one device, and it has a built-in SD card reader for easily accessing your photos to work on them.





“We all know that Apple builds great products, but what is great can always gain from becoming excellent, which is why we built the Keyhub Keyboard,” the Shenzhen, China-based brand writes. “[It’s] an ultra-smart all-in-one keyboard hub that offers extra features and the chance of increasing your working […] productivity when using Apple devices […]”

Compatible with Windows/Mac/Android desktops and laptops, the KD-K1 features an aluminum build with round scissor-switch keys.

Using a USB-C data port and USB-C PD charging port, the keyboard is compatible with 18w ~ 100w charging and can charge your devices while being used.

On the back of the keyboard are three USB-A 3.0 ports, one USB-A 2.0 port, an SD card slot, a TF card slot, and an HDMI port.

As the hub of your productivity, the keyboard is the one device you can plug your other devices into, whether it’s monitors, a mouse, or external hard drives.

The Kolude KD-K1 Keyhub is being launched through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign in SpaceGray and Silver colors.

The campaign has already raised over $100,000 (with an initial goal of around $10,000), and a contribution of ~$109 will get you one of the first units, assuming the company delivers on its promises.
