Gold Prices Dip 0.2%; Palladium Hits Another Record

Gold for February delivery declined $3.50, or 0.2%, to settle at $1,550.50 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.

"Gold is softer right now on stronger equities, and as the geopolitical front is also getting a little quiet when it comes to China and Iran issues," Reuters quoted Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures.

Gold prices ranged from a low of $1,548 to a high of $1,558.20. They gained 0.6% on Wednesday, they declined 0.4% on Tuesday — for their lowest close since Jan. 2, and they lost 0.6% on Monday.
