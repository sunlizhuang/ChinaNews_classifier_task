The New York-based Shen Yun company is bringing its all-new 2020 show to the area.

NORFOLK, Va. — Shen Yun is welcoming all to travel back to ancient China through the art of classical Chinese dance.

Legends will come to life in a performance at the Norfolk Chrysler Museum on February 25 -27. The New York-based Shen Yun company is bringing its all-new 2020 show to the area.

The performance will be part of its world tour, its fourteenth season. Audiences of all backgrounds find the show mesmerizing.

Shen Yun makes this possible by pushing the boundaries of the performing arts, with a unique blend of stunning costuming, high-tech backdrops, and an orchestra like no other.

The traditional Chinese culture Shen Yun presents cannot be seen in China. Yun said in China the ruling communist regime has viewed China’s rich spiritual and artistic heritage as a threat to its ideology and for decades tried to erase it.

In 2006, a group of Chinese artists came together in New York with a vision: to revive the best of China’s cultural heritage and share it with the world.

Today, Shen Yun has grown into seven companies performing around the world to sold-out audiences everywhere.

Some people fly China to the United States to see it.
