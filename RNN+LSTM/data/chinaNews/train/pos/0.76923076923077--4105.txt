A new study coming out of China is suggesting that people who drink tea may actually live longer.

This study, according to WILX, involved over 100,000 health adults for around seven years. People in the study who drank tea about three times a week had a lower risk for having a stroke, heart disease versus those who rarely ever drank tea. Those who also drank tea had a 30% chance of not dying during the study period.

This study helped showed the health benefits among those who would drink green tea. The study was held by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, which was later published in the "European Journal of Preventive Cardiology."
