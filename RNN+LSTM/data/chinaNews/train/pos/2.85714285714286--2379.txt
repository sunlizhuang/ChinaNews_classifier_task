Singaporean Michelin-starred restaurant Putien has opened its first eatery in the Philippines.

The Cantonese/Fujianese-style brand has been introduced to the territory by The Vikings Group and opens in The Podium in Ortigas as its 67th location internationally.

“Putien serves characteristically light, down-to-earth, and flavourful food, with an emphasis on fresh ingredients,” the restaurant’s founder and CEO Fong Chi Chung told the Manila Standard. The restaurant specialises in cuisine made from ingredients sourced exclusively from the Fujianese coast.





“The Fujian flavor gives a unique twist to the usual Cantonese-style food,” said Vikings Group marketing director Charles Lee. “We’re excited for Filipinos to finally try this new type of cuisine that’s making waves in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and China for its good quality and service”.
