CANTON-To help increase accessibility to those in Fulton County, The Breathing Tree yoga studio is now a non-profit.

The studio was opened four years ago by Nathan Taylor who has been involved with yoga for 20 years. He became certified in yoga in 2008.

“It’s made such a profound impact on my life that I wanted to share it with anyone who would listen,” Taylor said.

Since its opening, the cost to attend The Breathing Tree’s classes is by a suggested donation of $10.

In addition to yoga, the studio offers meditation classes and therapy massages as well as other wellness events, such as art and dance workshops.

The decision to seek non-profit status stems from the board’s vision to make the Breathing Tree accessible to everyone in Fulton County regardless of age and socio-economical status.

“Yoga in the Midwest has become an exclusive club and that’s not what yoga should be like,” said Lindsey Larson, one of the board members who has spearheaded the effort.

Larson explained the Breathing Tree’s plans for 2020, which include bringing free classes to the community, such as “in the park” events, at the Farmer’s Market and at the Fulton County Rehabilitation Center.

Special programs are also in the works for veterans suffering from combat-related issues, as well as starting meditation programs at the prison.

The Breathing Tree celebrated its new status with a ribbon cutting ceremony Thursday afternoon with members of the Canton Area Chamber of Commerce.

The studio is located at 17 E. Side Square in downtown Canton and can be contact at 815-901-1053. Their website is www.thebreathingtree.net.
