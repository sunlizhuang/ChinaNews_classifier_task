BEIJING, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- China will eventually win the fight against the novel coronavirus, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said Monday.

In a phone conversation with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Faisal, on behalf of the Saudi government and people, said Saudi Arabia supports China in its battle against the epidemic.

Faisal said Saudi Arabia commends China's strong measures to curb the spread of the virus and highly appreciates China's sense of responsibility in the prevention and control of the epidemic.

For his part, Wang thanked Saudi Arabia for its strong support at the critical moment in the fight against the disease, saying that China has set up a nationwide system that has held the Chinese from all walks of life together for an all-out campaign against the epidemic.

Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has spoken highly of China's strong measures against the epidemic and expressed confidence in China's effort to overcome the challenge, Wang said, noting that WHO has recommended against imposing travel and trade restrictions.

Wang said China is capable and confident of protecting the Chinese people's health and safety, and will continue to take effective measures to ensure the working and living conditions of foreign citizens, including Saudi nationals, in China, so as to make due contributions to the cause of international public health.

Underlining the tradition of mutual support between the two countries, Wang said the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Saudi Arabia has been deepening and that practical cooperation has yielded fruitful results in various fields.

Wang said he believes that Saudi Arabia will always stand with China in the fight against the epidemic, adding that the epidemic is temporary while China-Saudi Arabia cooperation and friendship are long-standing.
