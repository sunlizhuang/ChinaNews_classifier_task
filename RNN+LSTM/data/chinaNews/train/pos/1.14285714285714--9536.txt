NANNING, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- Researchers have captured underwater video of Bryde's whales for the first time in south China's Beibu Gulf.

Chen Mo, associate researcher of Guangxi Academy of Sciences and a member of the research team, said on Wednesday that the video is of great significance to the comprehensive understanding of the marine mammal's living habits, especially the study of its behavior.

"The video provides a significant scientific basis for large marine mammal protection and has important value for protecting the marine ecological environment of the Beibu Gulf," said Chen.

Bryde's whale, mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical waters, is regarded as a very mysterious species of cetaceans, with a body length of 10 to 12 meters and a weight of up to 15 tonnes.

The researchers have been conducting research on the whales when they were first discovered in waters off Weizhou Island in 2016.

Weizhou Island in Beibu Gulf, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is among the country's few coastal areas where large cetaceans frequently appear.
