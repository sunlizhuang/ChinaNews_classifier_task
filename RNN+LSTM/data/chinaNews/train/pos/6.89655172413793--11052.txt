Gov. Doug Burgum released the following statement today after President Donald Trump signed a Phase One Trade Agreement with China.

“With China committing to purchase at least $200 billion in additional U.S. goods and services over the next two years, including $40 billion to $50 billion in agricultural goods, this agreement represents a major win for North Dakota farmers and ranchers, who are among the best in the world and can compete with anyone on a level playing field,” Burgum said. “We’re grateful to President Trump and Ambassador Lighthizer for their efforts to eliminate trade barriers, improve market access and provide additional certainty to our ag producers, manufacturers and innovators, while also securing greater protections for intellectual property and technology transfers. Along with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement signed last October, this deal move us in the right direction toward fixing imbalances and ensuring fairer trade for all Americans.”
