The Thai people have shown support for and empathy with China during the coronavirus epidemic, according to Chinese journalists.

"What most impresses me are video clips on social media from the Thai government and immigration police. They send their moral support to the people of Wuhan and all over China," said Lou Wei, 32, a CCTV reporter who has worked in Thailand for seven years.

Banners offering moral support at shopping malls also show that Thai people do not blame Chinese people or China for causing the crisis, but believe Thailand and China have joined forces to solve the problem, he said on Wednesday.

"This really warms my heart... This incident makes me realise that Thailand is a good friend of China."

Mr Lou said Chinese people are aware of Thailand's supportive messages through posts shared via Chinese social and mainstream media.

Li Min, 49, a reporter from China Media Group who has worked in Thailand for two years, said moral support from Thailand has come from all levels of society, ranging from the royal institution to the government, members of parliament and the general public.

"In times of trouble, nothing is better than mutual understanding and help. This is the most impressive," she said.

"Chinese media has forwarded Thailand's message, and Chinese people certainly recognise the friendship of Thai people. While many countries are blocking Chinese visitors, Thailand has not closed its doors to Chinese people," Ms Li said.

Sohu.com, a popular tourism website for Chinese people, stated that Thailand does not place blame but is taking action to control the disease. Meanwhile, many countries have issued travel advisories against China, it wrote.
