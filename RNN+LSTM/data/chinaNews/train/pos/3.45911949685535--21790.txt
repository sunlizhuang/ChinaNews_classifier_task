There's nothing cuter and satisfying than watching two giant pandas having some real good sexy time.

Just ask this zoo from the Netherlands which celebrated the occasion by posting an uncensored image of its pandas vigorously at it.



While some of you might be grinning or even chuckling, according to the Ouwehands Dierenpark in Rhenen, the image means a lot.

For close to three years, the zoo had a tough time getting these two pandas, Xing Ya and Wu Wen, to make babies. Pandas, though not facing extinction, are endangered.



The giant pandas had arrived from China in 2017 and despite their award-winning enclosure they were not at all interested in each other.



The zoo tried all sorts of ways to get them to go at it by dousing the sleeping area of each panda with the other's urine. Oh, they also tried stimulating Xing Ya by making him watch numerous panda porn.



Poor dude. He was also trained to stand on his back feet to, you know, do it doggy style. Or is it panda style now? I'm not so sure anymore.



With time running out for the pair, their next best chance at having babies is next year, the two pandas finally did the deed recently!

“At the end of last week, we knew Wu Wen was ready and since that moment the keepers have been busy encouraging the animals in a special enclosure,” the zoo said in a Facebook post.

The couple's image of having sex has now been immortalized for the world to see and the zoo would do some tests to determine if Wu Wen would be a mother soon.



Give yourself a pat on the back, you two. Thank you for trying to save your species.
