Dutch technology company Philips is mulling a sale of its domestic appliances division saying it needed to make "courageous choices to stay relevant".

Philips said it was reviewing its options for the business, which generated €2.3bn (£2bn) in revenue last year, and said it would be making a decision over the next 12 to 18 months. It has already started creating a separate legal structure for the division.

However, chief executive Frans van Houten signaled a divestment was a likely option, saying the company did not fit into Philips' future as a "health technology leader".

"What made you great in the past might not make you great in the future," he added, pointing to the greater "innovation potential" in healthcare than in coffee machines and vacuum cleaners.

A sale would come as the latest step in a radical decade-long reshaping which has seen Philips hone in on opportunities in medical technology, and seek to shed its reputation as a n electronics conglomerate.
