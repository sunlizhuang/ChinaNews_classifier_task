The Lisbon Landmark Foundation will hold its 13th annual pancake breakfast from 8 to 11:30 a.m. Saturday at the Methodist Church, 114 E. Washington St., to commemorate Lisbon’s Founders Day. The cost is $6; $3 for ages 6-12 (under 5 free). “Proceeds from the breakfast will go towards helping restore Lisbon’s historic buildings,” said Landmark Foundation president Barb DeCort. Local government officials and their challengers, including county commissioners and this year’s Johnny Appleseed queen and court, will be on hand to help with breakfast. Art work will be provided by McKinley Elementary School students who will be displaying their renditions of the old administration building at the county fairgrounds. The foundation is also holding a Chinese auction with gifts donated by local merchants. For more information, contact the Lisbon Area Chamber of Commerce at 330-424-1803.
