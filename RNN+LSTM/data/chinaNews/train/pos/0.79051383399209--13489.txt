Vodafone and BT are expected to call for Boris Johnson to allow Chinese firm Huawei to have involvement in Britain’s 5G mobile phone network.

The two telecoms giants are preparing to write to the Prime Minister to warn that the UK’s digital economy risks being stunted if the manufacturer is banned.

Mr Johnson is said to be ‘comfortable’ with allowing Huawei a limited role – excluding it from contracts involving the most sensitive parts of the network

Mr Johnson is poised to allow the firm, which has close links to the Chinese state, to have a limited role in the 5G network, despite warnings that it will lead to a rift with President Donald Trump.

The US administration has threatened to limit security co-operation over the issue.

But Mr Johnson is said to be ‘comfortable’ with allowing Huawei a limited role – excluding it from contracts involving the most sensitive parts of the network – after assurances from British security officials.
