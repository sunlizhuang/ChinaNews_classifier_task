Growing up with a developmental disability is not only challenging for us; it can also be difficult for our siblings. When we are younger, they can be jealous of all the attention we seem to be getting. Medical problems, therapy appointments, and finding programs are some of the things that take up our parents’ time and concerns. Depending on the disability, communication can also be difficult.

In time, our siblings come to understand more about us, and they help us come up with ways to communicate and have fun with them.

- Sidney Cohen and his brother Allan: I grew up with two brothers. My younger brother Allan has autism and is nonverbal. Allan is a great guy. He likes music, walking, and he LOVES ketchup. I don't get to see him as much as I'd like to nowadays, but I'm forever grateful for our relationship. Having a special needs family member can be very tough, but living with him has taught me patience, understanding and fortitude. All these attributes are important in life and have left me well prepared for my career in the special needs community. I appreciate many things about Allan, but the one thing I appreciate most is his smile when he's happy. It's so genuine. -- Sidney Cohen, right, his brother Manuel, left, and his brother Allan seated. (Photo courtesy of Sidney Cohen) Life-Wire NewsLife-Wire News

Lindsay Hyland, whose sister has an intellectual disability, has embraced a mission to conduct Sibling Workshops to help foster these extraordinary relationships.

Hyland, the mother of two daughters, has three sisters. She “shares the middle” with her sister Julia Kennedy who attends Eden II Programs.

"[My sister] has taught me how important it is to understand that everyone is capable of learning new things

Hyland, a Livingston resident, is a teacher with the ACES program at IS 34. Her students, who had just celebrated the Lunar New Year by going out for Chinese food, listened quietly while she spoke with the Life-Wire News crew via Facebook Messenger.

“Growing up, everybody had their needs. My parents realized I might be interested in other kids who also had siblings with disabilities,” said Hyland. “I would be able to hang out with these other people. We would learn together and support each other.”

- Rebecca Matuszewski and her sister Nicole: Nicole, or as she has her way of reminding everyone that her name is Nicki, has been nothing short of a miracle to myself and my whole family. She is a strong, courageous, and very independent young woman, who doesn’t let anything get in her way. Nicki wants to be just like everyone else her age and does not like being excluded for her disability. She enjoys shopping, going out to eat and out for drinks with “our friends.” I put friends in quotes because all of my friends that have come into her life have accepted her and include her in everything we do together. Although Nicki is my younger sister and looks up to me, one thing she doesn’t know is that she is such an inspiration and role model to me, and I look up to her everyday. She has taught me to be more compassionate, loving, and understanding of everyone and not to judge a book by its cover. If I have a bad day all I have to do is look at her and she gives me one of her loving smiles and hugs and makes everything so much better. In other words I would be lost without her. She inspires me everyday to be a better person. (Photo courtesy of Rebecca Matuszewski) Life-Wire NewsLife-Wire News

About 10 years ago, Hyland became involved with SibsNY, part of a national volunteer network, that helps people make connections and find support for siblings with disabilities. She will conduct a Sibling Workshop to help families learn what is like to be a sibling with someone with a disability and to learn about services available.

“When I was growing up, I had a lot of support. It made me a better sister, a better advocate, and a better teacher,” said Hyland. “So I want to pay it forward and make sure everyone gets the support they need.”

- Mario Papa and his brother Paul: My relationship with Paul has been one that has brought me so much love and joy to my life. I wouldn’t trade anything about him for the world. He loves me unconditionally and that is the one thing I appreciate about him along with his outlook on life. Seeing him happy is all I can ever ask for. He has had a huge effect on my life and has brought so much positivity into it. I look beyond his disability and know that he too has value and a purpose in life. We share a special bond as brothers like no other, and I am incredibly grateful that he is my brother. Without Paul’s love and support, I honestly don’t know where I would be right now. I will always love him forever. (Photo courtesy of Mario Papa) Life-Wire NewsLife-Wire News

The workshop is for and about siblings, but it is open to parents, teachers -- “anyone who wants to help all their children.”

The workshop will be held at Person Centered Care Services, 150 Granite Ave., Mariners Harbor, at 6 p.m. on Feb. 6. It will include videos for discussion, a question and answer period and time to socialize. RSVP to Alyssa D’Agosto at adagosto@pccsny.org or 718-370-1088 x 219

- Joseph Loglisci and Keri-Anne: Keri-Anne is my youngest sister. She has moments when she’s funny. She has moments when she’s crabby. When something is bothering Keri, she won’t say anything. She’ll act out. I can tell by the way she’s acting what’s bothering her. Her favorite food is salad. I’m proud of her. She’s overcome a lot in her time. Her having a disability has gotten me into this field. Who knows where I would have went. (Life-Wire News/Aaron Bialer) Life-Wire NewsLife-Wire News

“One of the great things about these workshops is you get to meet other people and talk to each other,” said Hyland.

Everyone will leave with a packet with information and resources.

- Anthony Pabon and his brother Tory: I love him because he’s my brother. He plays Mario Cart, but with a backwards remote control. It’s been hard because he can’t really speak, so when you ask him something, he doesn’t comprehend. He looks at you when he’s affectionate. He loves to hug.I have ADD and he has autism. The different thing is that he is obsessive compulsive. He comes home and he starts putting cups out and fills them with coffee. We go out for Chinese food because he loves Chinese food. I hold his hand because he escapes. (Photo courtesy of Anthony Pabon) Life-Wire NewsLife-Wire News

- Kerry Ryan and her sister Kara: My sister Kara is my sunshine. We’ve been close since the day she was born when I was six years old. Me, Kara and my brother James were always together as kids. One of my favorite things we did together was create “music” (aka, noise) in our “Kitchy-Koo Kara Band.” It used to drive our parents crazy. But we always had a ton of fun and laughs. And now, even though she sees me as the uncool older sister, I still try to spend time with her when I can. A lot of the times she’s busy talking to her boyfriend. But she always has time to be an awesome aunt to my son, Finn and my daughter, Ruby. My world wouldn’t be the same without her and her infectious smile.
