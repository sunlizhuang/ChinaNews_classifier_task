A dazzling lantern show lit up Xi'an, capital city of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, to celebrate the upcoming Chinese New Year which falls on January 25 this year.

The lantern show opened at 19:30 on Friday and wowed visitors with huge bright colored lanterns decorating the ancient city walls of Xi'an.

The show consists of five parts which have different themes covering areas such as the ancient city's history, splendid landscape around the country, and a dream world for children.

In addition, Xi'an will work together with Shanghai and Nanjing to stage the light show simultaneously to celebrate the Chinese New Year.

Advanced technologies like AR (Augmented Reality) will be applied to the show to present a visual feast to the audience.

Initiated in 1984, the lantern show has a history of over 30 years. This year, it will run until February 24.
