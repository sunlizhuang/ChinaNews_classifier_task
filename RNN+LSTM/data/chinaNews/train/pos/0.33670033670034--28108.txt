Just as production for “The Land of Many Palaces” was wrapping up, Smith heard of a gated, secretive “cowboy town” that had popped up outside Beijing. Jackson Hole, China, was a place where people were leaving the city to go and live out their own versions of American culture and the American dream.

“I couldn’t get this place out of my head, the way they described it,” Smith said. “While my first film was about the mass movement of rural communities to cities, this story is the opposite — wealthy urban people leaving for imagined small-town American life because of issues like pollution and crime in the cities.”

Despite the town’s emphasis on privacy, Smith managed to live there for several months in the summer of 2015. As he collected interviews and filmed the day-to-day happenings of the town, a narrative started to emerge.

The story took shape around the collision and contrast of American and Chinese culture, and Smith began to examine what it meant for a community to copy an inferred lifestyle of another country.

The documentary primarily follows the life of a woman named Annie Liu, who came to Jackson Hole, China, because of her love for American culture and her hope of fulfilling the ever-elusive American dream.
