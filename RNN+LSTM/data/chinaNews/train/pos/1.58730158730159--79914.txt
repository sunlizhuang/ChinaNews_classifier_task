UK red meat exports were worth more than £1.5 billion last year.

The latest figures from HMRC reveal the total value of red meat exports was up 13% last year, as more than 661,000 tonnes of pork, lamb and beef were shipped around the world.

The majority of the exports were to Europe. However strong growth was recorded for all three meats to non-EU countries.

The value of beef and offal exports was up 7.5% to £532 million for 183,000 tonnes, while sheepmeat and offal shipments were up 12,5% to 99,000 tonnes, with a value of £402m.

Pig meat exports were up 24% to 378,000 tonnes, worth £609m, with sales to China up 61% to 131,000 tonnes, worth £191m.

“This year has been phenomenal,” said farm levy body AHDB’s international market development director, Dr Phil Hadley.

“As well as a record year in terms of both volume and value, we have also seen some incredible market access wins, which has helped make 2019 one of the best years for our red meat exports.”

Market wins include the reopening of the Japanese market for beef and lamb.
