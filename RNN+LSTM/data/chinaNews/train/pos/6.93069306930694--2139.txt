BEIJING: President Xi Jinping hailed Laos as China’s good neighbour, good friend, good comrade and good partner, saying the two sides must move forward with the building of a community with a shared future and better align their development strategies.

In talks with Lao Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith in Beijing, Xi said the two countries should stand closely together, like passengers in the same boat, and jointly safeguard the common interests not only of both sides but of all developing countries.

Communist leadership and the socialist system is ingrained in the political character of both sides, and the tradition of high-level exchanges must be maintained, Xi said.

He urged both sides to step up exchanges on governance to jointly improve the level and capacity of governance and safeguard their political security.

China will continue to offer firm support to Laos in its efforts to guard its national sovereignty, independence and dignity, he said.

He appealed to both sides to align their development strategies, accelerate the development of the China-Laos Economic Corridor and make concrete progress in cooperation in major programmes, such as railways and economic parks. — China Daily/ANN
