TAIPEI (Reuters) - Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of Apple supplier Foxconn, said on Wednesday he was advising company employees not to visit China over the coming Lunar New Year holiday, amid concerns over a new coronavirus.

“The speed of contagion will be no less than SARS,” Gou said at the company’s Lunar New Year party. “I advise everyone not to go to the mainland for this coming New Year holiday.”
