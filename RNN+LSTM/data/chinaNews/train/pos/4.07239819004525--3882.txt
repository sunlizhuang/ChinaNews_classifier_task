The Fairfield Travelogue continues its tour around the world on Thursday, January 9, with “How to Barter for Paradise”, presented by Michael Wigge.

Join award-winning reporter Michael Wigge on a wild ride as he trades up an apple to a house in Hawaii in forty-two steps. In “How to Barter for Paradise”, Wigge travels through fourteen countries and across six continents exchanging goods for more valuable ones to turn a bitten apple into a Hawaiian dream home – and he meets an array of good-humored people who take his deals.

Future programs include:

On February 13, “Tibet: A Light in the Darkness”, a film by Sean Cassidy, will be hosted by Tom Sterling.

On March 12, “Albinos & Aliens: In Search of the Albinos, Florida’s Alien Wildlife” will be presented by Tom Sterling.

On April 9, “The Royal Inca Road”, a film by Karin Mullers, will be hosted by Sandy Mortimer.

All of the programs will be held at the First Baptist Church at 308 S 1st Street in Fairfield. Each presentation will begin at 7:15 p.m.

Season tickets are $30.00 and will be sold at the door the evening of the event. Tickets are also available at McDowell, Kenshalo, & Jesop in Fairfield.

This year’s Fairfield Travelogue is sponsored by the Fairfield Rotary Club and the Wayne County Farm Bureau.
