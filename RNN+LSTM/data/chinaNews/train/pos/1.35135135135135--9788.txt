Haiti - Taiwan : Arrival of 400 tonnes of rice





The Republic of China/Taiwan has donated 400 metric tonnes of rice to Haiti through the Economic and Social Assistance Fund (FAES) for the benefit of the Haitian people. The landing took place last weekend at the port of the National Port Authority (APN) at the Bicentenary.



2,200 metric tonnes of rice are to be delivered to FAES on behalf of the Haitian government during this month to help vulnerable populations meet their food needs.



On behalf of the President of the Republic, Jovenel Mo√Øse and the Haitian people in general, the Directorate General of the Economic and Social Assistance Fund thanked the government of the Republic of China/Taiwan which has spared no efforts to support Haiti at the time as several thousand people face food insecurity.
