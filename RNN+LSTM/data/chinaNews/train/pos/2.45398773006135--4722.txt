A New Year meeting attended by representatives from China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region and Vietnam's four provinces bordering China was held in Liuzhou from Jan 6 to 7 to enhance friendship and deepen pragmatic cooperation.

All parties reviewed the collaborations achieved in the past year and reached consensus in multiple fields to work on together in 2020, including trade, investment and tourism.

They also pledged to continue exchanges in cross-border logistics, finance, labor services, agriculture, forestry and science and to maintain sound friendship among people in border areas.

Law enforcement, judicial cooperation and information sharing will also be strengthened to jointly combat cross-border crime.

The year 2020 marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Vietnam, as well as the fifth anniversary of the New Year meeting between Guangxi and the Communist Party of Vietnam secretaries of the four border provinces, including Lang Son, Cao Bang, Ha Giang and Quang Ninh.
