Taipei, Feb. 4 (CNA) Former Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin (郝龍斌) completed the field for next month's election for Kuomintang (KMT) party chairman, registering his candidacy by Tuesday's deadline.

Hau's only opponent will be KMT Legislator Chiang Chi-chen (江啟臣), who registered Monday.

Hau submitted 40,632 signatures from registered, dues-paying KMT party members, far above the 7,751 needed to qualify as a candidate and more than the 34,782 signatures Chiang submitted.

When he registered, he was accompanied by former Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu (胡志強), KMT legislators Lin Yi-hua (林奕華), Lu Ming-che (魯明哲), Lai Shyh-bao (賴士葆) and Alex Fai (費鴻泰), and Taipei City Council Speaker Chen Jiin-shyang (陳錦祥).

The KMT will hold its election for a new chairman on March 7 to replace former Chairman Wu Den-yih (吳敦義), who resigned just days following the party's resounding defeat in the Jan. 11 presidential and legislative elections.

Hau, who served as the party's vice chairman under Wu, was one of the four senior party leaders who resigned with the former chairman.

Speaking after completing his registration, Hau reiterated his promise to promote younger party members to key leadership roles, noting that cultivating talent is most important to the KMT.

As chairman, he said, he would selflessly lead the party out of the woods, and would not use the role as a stepping stone for other political posts.

Regarding the KMT's recalibration of its position on relations with China, Hau said he hoped the party can reach a consensus through dialogue and discussion, and that he agreed with Chiang on holding a debate on the issue.

Similar to Chiang, Hau also said he would work on strengthening the KMT's relations with the United States if elected.

This can be accomplished by establishing a KMT representative to the U.S. who can deepen Washington's understanding of the party and fight for international recognition of Taiwan, Hau said.
