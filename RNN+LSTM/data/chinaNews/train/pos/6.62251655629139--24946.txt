The Chinese New Year dawned on January 25, ushering in the Year of the Rat, seen by many to be a lucky year.

Each year represents a particular animal according to Chinese astrology. A symbol of diligence, kindness, and generosity, the rat has also been celebrated in 1912, 1924, 1936, 1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996, 2008.

With beautiful red decorations all over the Shang Palace at Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo, the Chinese new year celebrations kicked off on January 20. Continuing until February 8, the gourmet set menus for lunch and dinner are priced from LKR 7,488 ++ per person, with the Yu Sheng, prosperity toss at LKR 1,888 ++ for two persons.

The event kicked off with the Yu Sheng or prosperity toss, a time honoured Chinese New Year tradition. Served on a large platter with a variety of ingredients including raw fish, shredded raddish and carrots, pickled ginger and more, the ceremony begins with lemon juice being poured atop the salmon, which is then mixed in with the other ingredients. The Angpao, which consist of five spices and white pepper is added to the top. Guests and invitees stood around the table and mixed the dish with their chopsticks.

Master Chef Bun Boon handpicked the dishes on the menu with a wide variety of different Chinese food, suitable for both meat eaters and vegetarians. One of the most interesting dishes that was presented was the Squid ink truffle prawn dumpling, light black in colour. The Wok fried baby lobster with red bell pepper and chili, Kung pao chicken with cashew nuts and Sweet corn soup with fish and bean curd were also some of the crowd-pleasers.
