SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- The 29th annual RSA Conference that focuses on internet security, security technology, data protection, security products and strategies kicked off here Monday.

The conference brought together the world's top cybersecurity professionals, business leaders and scholars from top U.S. universities, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to discuss emerging trends and formulate the best strategies for tackling current and future threats in the cyber world.

The event, themed Human Element this year, will highlight global efforts to protect not only data, but also vulnerable people and every aspect of their daily life, from online misdeeds such as hacking, privacy violation and weaponization of social media.

"In its 29-year history, RSA Conference has evolved to meet new demands of the ever-changing world of cybersecurity," said Linda Martin, senior director and general manager of the RSA Conference 2020.

"One thing has always remained constant, and that's the importance of the human element in driving the industry forward," she added.

The RSA Conference 2020 will feature nearly 700 exhibitors from across the industry, including some from China.

On Thursday, San Francisco Mayor London Breed encouraged companies and exhibitors to participate the conference, which is expected to draw more than 40,000 participants in the next four days.
