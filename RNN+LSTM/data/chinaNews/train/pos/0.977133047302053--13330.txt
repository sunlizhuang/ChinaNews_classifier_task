KALAMA — Kalama residents will get a chance to weigh in whether the city should send Gov. Jay Inslee a letter in support of the $2 billion methanol plant after the City Council balked on the matter Thursday night.

The council rebuffed Councilman Steve Kallio, who drafted a supporting letter, and instead voted 3-1 to have the city attorney review the letter and hold a town hall meeting on the controversial proposal.

The town hall tentatively is set for 5:30 p.m. on Feb. 20 in the Community Building.

Mayor Mike Reuter, an outspoken critic of the methanol project, said the council needs to “do this the right way” and hold a town hall to give everyone a chance to speak. He said Thursday that he has a lot of information on the project he hasn’t shared, and it is “something I would love to discuss.”

Councilwoman Sandra Macias-Hughes said she opposed sending the letter because she believes the City Council should remain neutral. She cast the lone “no” vote on the motion to hold a town hall.

“I don’t think the governor is going to care one way or another,” she said. “I don’t think the (Department of Ecology) is going to care. They know there are people in this town that support it and people in this town that oppose it.”
