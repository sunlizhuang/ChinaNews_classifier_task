Xiaomi CFO Chew Shou Zhi recently went on Bloomberg for an interview, and he revealed some quite interesting information. According to Chew, Xiaomi is planning to make a huge push for the 5G market in China in 2020. More interestingly however, he also claims that the Xiaomi‘s plan for 2020 includes a big emphasis on Western Europe due to them gaining plenty of traction there.

Chew claims that the company has made huge strides in Western Europe, becoming the 4th largest smartphone maker there. In Spain, Xiaomi is even the LARG, a solid acheivement. The company’s success doesn’t end at smartphones however as they also conquer a big chunk of Western Europe’s wearable market, being the 2nd largest wearable company there.

Perhaps the biggest surprise when it comes to Western Europe however is that Xiaomi’s Scooters are big sellers. The company’s scooters conquer more than 70% of the market share in many countries in Western Europe, though he doesn’t specify which ones. He also mentions that Xiaomi grew by 90% in Western Europe over 2019, making them one of the top 4 fastest growing companies there.

Chew goes on to talk about how Xiaomi plans to launch 10 5G smartphones in China for 2020, and they’re also planning to bring their 5G product portfolio to their other countries of operation, which includes South-East Asian markets, African markets, Latin American markets, the Indian market and of course, the Western European market. When asked about whether Xiaomi plans to bring 5G devices the US however, Chew remains coy, meaning American Mi Fans will probably have to continue waiting.
