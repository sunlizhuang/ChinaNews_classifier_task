China has appreciated Prime Minister Imran Khan's recent remarks about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

In a statement issued today (Saturday), the Chinese Foreign Ministry said since the launch of the CPEC, significant positive progress has been made.

It said at least 32 projects have yielded early harvests, playing an important role in promoting Pakistan's economic and social development and improving people's well-being.

In advancing the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, China has always followed the principle of joint consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, and has always given priority to the interests of the Pakistani people.

The statement said China is ready to work with Pakistan to continue to promote high-quality development of the Corridor and bring more benefits to the two peoples. We have full confidence in the future of the corridor.
