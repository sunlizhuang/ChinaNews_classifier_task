Arrow Minerals joins forces with Roxgold for Hounde South earn-in

Arrow Minerals Ltd (ASX:AMD) has joined forces with Roxgold Inc (TSE:ROXG) (OTCMKTS:ROGFF) after signing an earn-in agreement covering Arrow's Hounde South Gold Project in southwest Burkina Faso.

The definitive agreement, which has been finalised and executed, enables Roxgold to earn up to a 70% interest in the project.



Earn-in stages

This will be achieved after expenditure of up to US$1 million (approximately A$1.5 million) in exploration in two stages over four years.

Hounde South consists of two exploration licences, the Fofora and Konkoira permits, adjacent to Roxgold's Boussoura permit.



A "strategic fit"

Arrow's chief executive officer Howard Golden said: "The earn-in agreement with Roxgold is a strategic fit for Arrow as it allows Arrow to focus its resources on its more advanced projects including the recent Dassa gold discovery, while working with a well-respected and successful Burkina Faso miner.

"Roxgold owns the Yaramoko gold mine in the same geological belt as Hounde, as well as active exploration projects in Burkina Faso."
