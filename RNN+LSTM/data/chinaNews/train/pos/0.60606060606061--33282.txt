Foreign Affairs Ministry assures parents, others of relations safety in China

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and regional Integration is assuring parents, relatives and friends of Ghanaians domiciled in China that the Ghana Embassy in China and the Consulate-Generale in Guangzhou are in contact with the leadership of the Ghanaian community and the National Union of Ghana Students-China receiving frequent briefing on the welfare of all Ghanaian nationals.



It is therefore advising all Ghanaians to stay indoors and adhere to preventive precautions outlined by Chinese authorities.



In a statement, it said “currently no Ghanaian has contracted the novel coronavirus even though we have about 152students in Wuhan where the virus were first reported.”



Again, the Embassy is in contact with the students and is liaising with their leadership, the Wuhan Foreign Office and universities to ensure the continued safety of students and the provision of basic necessities.



The statement added that the Ministry and its mission in Beijing are currently engaged with relevant authorities both in Ghana and in China on various possibilities for the safety of all Ghanaian nationals and the general public will be updated subsequently.



Additionally, Ghanaians intending to travel to China during this period must buy medical insurance, acquaint themselves with the nearest medical facility where they treat high fevers and also speak English or have a translator who can help in case of emergency. Anyone also visiting Wuhan would be subject to a mandatory 14-days quarantine before leaving the province.



The Ministry stated that it remains resolute on working the various Ghanaian communities and the students in China to ensure that they are provided with the needed consular services within their remit.



Meanwhile, most universities in China have postponed their re-opening dates indefinitely.
