President Xi Jinping on Sunday and Monday inspected troops stationed in southwest China's Yunnan Province ahead of the Spring Festival, or Chinese Lunar New Year.



Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), extended Chinese Lunar New Year's greetings to all soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, armed police, militia and reserve forces, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the CMC.

Xi on Sunday went to see soldiers guarding the border, chatting with them, checking their working and living conditions, and visiting a medical center and a canteen at their base.

After having a teleconference with officers and soldiers at the frontline, Xi said those at the frontline must maintain high alert and organize border patrols well to safeguard border peace and stability as well as the safety of the people and their property.

Meeting with senior military officers in Kunming on Monday, Xi said the troops in Yunnan have resolutely implemented the decisions and instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the CMC, and made important contributions to safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests, as well as supporting local economic and social development.

Xi said facing arduous tasks in various fields in 2020, the armed forces must implement the Party's thinking on strengthening the military and military strategy for the new era, and resolutely accomplish all tasks entrusted by the Party and the people.
