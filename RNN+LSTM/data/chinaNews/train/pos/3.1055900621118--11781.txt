AMMAN, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- Ten X-ray machines donated by China were formally put into use on Thursday in Jordan.

A ceremony was held by the Jordanian Customs Department at the Queen Alia International Airport, with the presence of Chinese Ambassador to Jordan Pan Weifang and Jordanian Finance Minister Mohammad Ississ.

The Chinese ambassador said the homegrown Chinese devices, bought with a grant provided by China, are one of the most advanced in the world.

He added that they will help improve the inspection capability of Jordan's customs and enhance the social and economic development in Jordan.

The grant, he said, is "a reflection of the friendship between the two countries."

The Jordanian minister voiced appreciation for the Chinese government, adding that the machines will help Jordan in combating smuggling.

Some of the devices are installed in the Jordanian border areas with Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria and Palestine.
