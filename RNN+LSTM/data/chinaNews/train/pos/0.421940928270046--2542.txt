China demand​

In 2019, China took the lead among Brazil's international poultry destinations, with total imports of 585,300 tons, 34% more than in 2018 (438,000 tons). In December China imported 72,000 tons, 94% more than in December 2018.

“The health crisis that impacted Chinese pig farming also influenced the increase in chicken meat exports. It is the largest annual volume ever exported to China since the market opened in 2009 and there has been a noticeable increase in the pace at the end of the year,”​ said Ricardo Santin, ABPA's executive director.

Japan also increased its purchases by 7% in 2019, with a total volume of 424,000 tons while in the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had total imports of 341,100 tons, 10% higher than the previous year.

Yemen also increased its imports of chicken meat from Brazil, with a total of 105,900 tons, an increase of 24% compared to 2018.

“The flow of exports, especially to Asia and the Middle East, is expected to remain positive in 2020. The international animal protein market is under pressure from Asian demand in particular,”​ added ABPA president Francisco Turra.
