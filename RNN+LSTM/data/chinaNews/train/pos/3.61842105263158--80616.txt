Rather than roses, chocolate and kisses, Bhubawit "Roj" Kritpholnara encourages people to exchange T-shirts instead during the month of love.

Last year, the fashion designer celebrated the 20th anniversary of his fashion label ISSUE. The humble beginning started with painted T-shirts, and he has returned to making basic wear for a good cause.

Launched on Valentine's Day, the latest project is a collaboration between ISSUE and Kiss Models, headed by Phutithorn Sa-ang. Blending the first letter of the name of the modelling agency, K, with ISSUE, gives "KISSUE" emblazoned on the white T-shirt.

It can amorously refer to "kiss you" but for this February, which has 29 days, Bhubawit wants to raise more important issues, rather than romance, such as air pollution and coronavirus outbreak.

The latter rang in the New Year, as on Dec 31, the World Health Organisation was informed of strange cases with pneumonia in Wuhan, Hebei province in China.

The cause was later identified by Chinese authorities as the novel coronavirus, which is still at large and dominating the daily headlines. Fatalities are mostly in China, where the situation remains dire at the epicentre. This week, the director of a Wuhan hospital died from Covid-19, the official name of the disease since Feb 11.

The situation reported by the Ministry of Public Health, as of Feb 17, indicated 35 cases of Covid-19 in Thailand.

The KISSUE project was initiated to raise funds for the Ramathibodi Foundation and support treatment of Coronavirus patients.

Priced at 690 baht, the T-shirts are available at ISSUE's Paragon, Emporium and Siam 3 stores, until the end of the month.

Hopefully, there will be no more new cases, and Bhubawit believes that we will pass the Covid-19 crisis and enjoy the rest of the leap year.
