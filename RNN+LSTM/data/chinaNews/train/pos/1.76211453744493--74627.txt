Delta Air Lines is reaching out to passengers on a Feb. 6 flight from Hawaii to Japan after two passengers on that flight were diagnosed with coronavirus.

Atlanta-based Delta said it is working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Japanese health officials about Flight 611 from Honolulu to Nagoya.

The Hawaii Department of Health said it was notified by the CDC of a Japanese man who traveled with his wife to Maui and Oahu and was later diagnosed with COVID-19, or novel coronavirus. His wife was also later diagnosed with the virus, according to news reports.

The airline said it is reaching out to customers who were on that flight and “taking the necessary steps to ensure the safety of our customers and crew.”

Delta earlier this month suspended all of its flights to China, including its Atlanta-Shanghai route. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said the China flights made up about 2% of the airline’s revenues.
