Jose Luis Bernal, Mexico’s ambassador to China, said that in the last 18 months, there has been more interest from Chinese firms looking to make cars in Mexico.

At least three Chinese automakers are preparing to produce vehicles in Mexico or expand existing operations, the Mexican ambassador to China earlier this week, in what would be a boost to one of the Latin American country’s top export industries.

Jose Luis Bernal, Mexico’s ambassador to China, said that over the past year and a half his office has seen more interest from Chinese firms looking to make cars in Mexico.

Bernal, speaking at an event in Mexico City, listed Chongqing-based carmaker Changan, electric car maker BYD, and Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co, known as JAC, as actively eyeing production facilities in Mexico.

Changan and BYD do not yet have production facilities in Mexico, and while JAC does, Bernal said the firm is considering an expansion. He added that the companies are aiming to begin the expanded Mexican operations sometime in the next year.
