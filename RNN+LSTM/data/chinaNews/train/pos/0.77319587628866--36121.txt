Brisbane lord mayor Adrian Schrinner has called for community calm in the wake of Queensland's first confirmed case of coronavirus.

Cr Schrinner said no Lunar New Year events hosted by Brisbane City Council had been cancelled, but he would abide by Queensland Health advice on large assemblies.

The Lunar New Year is set to be celebrated in Fortitude Valley's Chinatown on Saturday and Sunday as part of the council's annual BrisAsia Festival, a month-long citywide celebration of Asian culture.

"I have a whole range of Lunar New Year events coming up, I'm looking forward to those events," Cr Schrinner said.
