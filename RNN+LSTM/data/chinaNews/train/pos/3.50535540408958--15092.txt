What is the significance of the Year of the Rat?

The arrival of the 2020 Chinese New Year marks the beginning of the Year of the Rat.

The years on the Chinese calendar are divided into 12-year cycles, meaning that the next Year of the Rat will occur in 12 years’ time.

Last year marked the Year of the Pig, the last animal on the Chinese zodiac, while 2021 will signify the Year of the Ox, the second in the cycle. The rat is the first of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac.

Some view the rodent as being symbolic of intelligence and quick-witticism, as demonstrated in a popular story told as part of the Chinese New Year celebrations.

According to the myth, the Jade Emperor organised a race for a group of animals on his birthday, the results of which determined the order of the Chinese zodiac.

Legend goes that the rat was able to hitch a ride on the back of the ox, jumping off at the finish line in order to win first place and be named the first animal in the cycle.

The Travel China Guide further illustrates that those born in the Year of the Rat are known for being adaptable, observant and stubborn.

As rats are known for reproducing large numbers of offspring, they are also perceived as being symbolic of fertility.

People whose birth dates occurred in the Year of the Rat include those born in 1924, 1936, 1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996 and 2008.

Famous individuals born in the Year of the Rat include William Shakespeare, Katy Perry, Scarlett Johansson and the Duke of Sussex.

How is the Chinese New Year observed?

In addition to China, the Chinese New Year is celebrated in countries across the world, including Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.

Celebrations last for around two weeks from New Year's Eve up until the beginning of the Lantern Festival.

The festivities traditionally begin with a thorough cleaning of the home, with red paper lanterns and banners inscribed with poetic sayings hung as decorations.

Red is believed to bring good fortune, hence its prevalence during Chinese New Year and the reason why children are given "luck money" in red envelopes throughout the proceedings.

A symbolic feast is eaten among family on New Year's Eve during the Nian Ye Fan family reunion dinner, following the world's largest mass migration undertaken by those who observe festival making their way home.

The Chinese New Year will also be observed with prayers recited in temples, New Year's Day fireworks displays and lavish parades.
