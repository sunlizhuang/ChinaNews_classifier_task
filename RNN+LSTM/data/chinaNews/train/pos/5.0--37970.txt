President Trump recently approved a phase 1 trade agreement between the US and China. Minnesota representative Jim Hagedorn says while the approval was a positive, there’s more work to be done.

“I think the administration was smart to keep the tariffs on,” said Hagedorn. “A lot of that was purchasing our agricultural products. Phase two is going to involve a lot more regarding manipulation or currency or technology. I think if they want the tariffs to go away they’re going to have to comply.”

Hagedorn says he’s encouraging the administration to take a trust but verify approach in future negotiations with China.
