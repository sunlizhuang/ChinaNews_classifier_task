The Medical Officer of Health for Hastings Prince Edward says there are three major things to remember in avoiding coronavirus.

They are all very familiar health precautions, including washing your hands.

Medical Officer of Health Dr. Piotr Oglaza told the Board of of Health on Wednesday there are 24,000 confirmed cases in the world and almost 400 deaths, almost all in China.

Oglaza said, “It has never been seen in humans before…People need to be in close contact to be infected by the virus…Health officials are learning more about it everyday and proceeding with caution.”

Referring to the Canadians being returned here from Wuhan, China, board member, Mayor of Marmora and Lake Jan O’Neill, noted, “The Canadians are being repatriated to our community. Our community is unique in having the air base (CFB Trenton). That is one of the things that should be added to our consultations.” The province is holding consultations with public health and ambulance services regarding possible changes to their future makeup and finances.

Oglaza tells Quinte News local health units are playing supportive roles to Public Health Canada.

He says, “We are conducting local surveillance. All the guidelines are in place.”

He notes the processes can manage any pathogen coming into Canada.

Oglaza adds that the advice for the public to protect themselves from coronavirus is the same as for the common cold and influenza.

Mayor of Tweed Jo-Anne Albert, who was re-elected Board Chair, paid tribute to the public health staff working with federal authorities on the issue.
