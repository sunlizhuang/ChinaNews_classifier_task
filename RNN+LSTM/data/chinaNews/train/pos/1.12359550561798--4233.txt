SHANGHAI (Reuters) – China’s internet firms have fallen behind global peers in sourcing energy from clean, renewable sources, with soaring use of internet data driving up energy demand and carbon emissions, environmental group Greenpeace said in a report on Thursday. As capacity rises rapidly, the internet data sector could account for a third of total global power demand within two decades, putting tech giants in China and elsewhere under heavy pressure to find cleaner sources of electricity. “Power consumption from China’s internet industry is skyrocketing, and it’s imperative that Chinese internet giants lead the sector to break away from its reliance on coal,” said Ye Ruiqi, a Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner. Tencent was the only major firm to disclose energy consumption and carbon emission levels but it has “made almost no progress” on renewable energy procurement, Greenpeace said, while Huawei was the only firm to set emission reduction targets. Power consumption from the sector was expected to reach 267 TWh by 2023, more than Australia’s total electricity demand, it added.
