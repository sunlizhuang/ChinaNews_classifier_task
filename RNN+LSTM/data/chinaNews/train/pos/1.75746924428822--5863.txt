Laura Whitmore admits she can be jealous of Love Island’s surgically enhanced contestants.

Like millions of its viewers, the show’s new host sometimes feels glum when she scrolls through her Instagram feed.

The cast are plucked from profiles on the picture sharing site where users preen themselves for body-beautiful selfies.

Laura, 34, said: “I get Instagram envy. You go, ‘Oh my God, look at them in their bikini bodies and they’re on holiday. And why am I not doing that job?

“You are constantly doing that and then you realise half of that stuff isn’t real anyway. We’ve got a whole other load of pressures.”

Laura says celebs should act responsibly by posting “real” pictures rather than just flattering ones.

“I put awards pictures up and then think that’s not real,” she said. “I’ve got this internal thing going in my head asking myself, ‘Am I being responsible just putting up the nice pictures? Shall I put up more bad pictures?’

“But I don’t want to put bad ones up there! We do have that responsibility ourselves.”

Laura has been in showbiz for more than a decade since her MTV breakthrough. But taking over assault-charge presenter Caroline Flack’s Love Island gig is easily her biggest challenge to date.

Laura is seizing her chance with both hands and says she wants to be the latest in a long line of strong women on the box.

“Now is a good time to be a female in the industry,” she said.

“Davina McCall is someone I looked up to, learning that you could be the lead anchor. I grew up with these strong females on TV – the Cat Deeleys and Holly Willoughbys, Fearne Cottons and Edith Bowmans. I thought, I will not be the token girl.”

Laura will join forces with boyfriend Iain Stirling who has been the much-loved narrator since Love Island hit our screens in 2015.

The pair have been dating for two years and Laura says he is the key to her happiness.

“Iain can make me happy with a Chinese takeaway! When I feel sad my boyfriend will come home with a Chinese takeaway and I’m like, ‘Oh, I’m happy again.’ It’s the simple things. It’s all food related.”

But Laura opened up about her tough split from Coronas rocker Danny O’Reilly when she was filming I’m A Celebrity in 2012.

“Big things have happened in my life and I’ve been down and upset through break-ups,” she said.

“It gets better with time. There is something comforting in the fact that we all go through sh*t.

“I remember this massive break-up and I was doing live telly. You think you’re the only person going through a break-up.

“I felt so low because I was trying to pretend everything was OK and I had to have this front.

“Now I look back, the only way I could get through was talking to other people. I found great comfort in that.

“People deal with things differently. Friends for me was a big thing – coming over with ice cream and listening to you whinge.”
