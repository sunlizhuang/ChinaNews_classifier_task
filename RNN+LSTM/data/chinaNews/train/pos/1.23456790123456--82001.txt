Recently, Mark McGowan, the premier of the Western Australian Parliament expressed great concern about the friendship between Western Australia and China.

He said China is an important trade partner and a large number of Chinese students are studying in Western Australia, which welcomes tens of thousands of Chinese tourists every year. Moreover, there are about 100,000 Chinese people living in Western Australia. During the novel coronavirus outbreak, Western Australia will support Chinese communities.

On Feb 17, a proposal to support Wuhan was passed by the city of Sydney.

In the proposal, Clover Moore, the Lord Mayor of Sydney, praised the urgent measures taken by the Chinese government in face of the outbreak.

She expected Australian manufacturers could give a hand to China as the medical supplies are in a shortage in many places in China, which the Office of the Lord Mayor will assist with as well. She expressed her sincere support to Wuhan and the Chinese people on behalf of Sydney citizens.

Australian entrepreneurs also showed support to China.

In a recently published article, the former CEO of Fortescue Metals Group, Andrew Forrest, and its current CEO Elizabeth Gaines pointed out that Australia should be thankful for the sacrifices made by China and gave the country full support, as the novel coronavirus is a global challenge.

The donations from the group will be spent on urgent medical supplies and the building of hospitals in Wuhan.
