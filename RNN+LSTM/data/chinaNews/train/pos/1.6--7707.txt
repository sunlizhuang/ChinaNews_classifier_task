What is truly remarkable about Mount Fanjingshan is not its appearance or religion, but the life it nurtures. Today, as the domestic ecological environment deteriorates, the natural vegetation in Mount Fanjingshan, a small "island", still remains relatively primitive, and is witness to the survival, reproduction and evolution of more than 6,000 kinds of plants and animals.

On July 2, 2018, Mount Fanjingshan in Guizhou became China's 53rd world heritage. Today, the development of Guizhou evolves rapidly with each passing day, and the growth rate of tourism is over 40 percent. It is hoped that this "island" of life can be protected at the same time, so that it can remain unchanged. (photo via INSTITUTE FOR PLANETS)
