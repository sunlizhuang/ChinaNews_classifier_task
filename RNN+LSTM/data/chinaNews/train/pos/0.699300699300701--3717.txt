Learn From The Young: Toddler Picks Up Bottle Thrown By Car Driver And Hands It Back To Him

Littering is not cool, even toddlers know that. And a little boy gave that lesson to an adult in China.

A one-year-old Chinese boy saw a motorist littering the road with a plastic bottle and the little one picked up the bottle thrown on the pavement by the driver and handed it back to him through the car window.

A video of the incident was made by the toddler’s mom, and it's now going viral.

However, according to the toddler’s mother, there is a possibility that the little one thought that the bottle had fallen out of the hand of the driver by mistake and went to hand it back to him.

Internet users in China are unanimously praising the child and urging adults to learn from the toddler.

The little boy’s name is Sun Jiarui and he lives in the city of Jining in eastern China's Shandong Province.

Jing Lulu, the toddler’s mom reportedly has a habit of filming her son learning to walk, whenever they go out and she filmed this by chance

Talking about the incident Jing told Daily Mail, “That day, he probably thought the bottle had fallen from the car by accident. He is a very simple child. If he sees other people drop stuff, he always helps to pick up. He is only one year and three months old and probably doesn't have a strong sense of environmental protection, but his action taught the driver a lesson.”

One is never too old to learn, never to young to teach.
