Two years ago, we had no idea what Realme would become. From a small sub-brand into one of the hottest smartphone makers in the world. The company that started with low-end and mid-range smartphones now is building a consistent portfolio of flagship smartphones. After the Realme X2 Pro, the company is now gearing up to release a new flagship market with Global availability. The Chinese firm will be attending at Mobile World Congress (MWC) later this month. There, we will see a brand new smart tv, and a new Realme flagship, which will come with 5G support.

The support for the new network standard has been confirmation straight from the company’s European branch. Through its Twitter account, the company posted a new teaser with the “Hey, MWC, It’s Realme! We are ready to be the 5G Populariser.” caption. The image also includes text “New Player realme MWC Debut”.

Unfortunately, Realme is keeping a low profile when it comes to providing info about its upcoming high-end smartphone. However, it was spotted on AnTuTu last month, with the Snapdragon 865 SoC in tow. Moreover, this seems to be the highly-anticipated smartphone that the company’s India CEO Madhav Sheth teased last month. According to him, it will be “bigger and better” than the Realme X50 5G that is currently available in China.

Besides the new Snapdragon 865-powered smartphone and Smart TV, the Chinese firm will also be revealing its first fitness brand this month. The company is definitely expanding its portfolio in 2020 and we are excited to see what Realme’s ecosystem of products will have for us.
