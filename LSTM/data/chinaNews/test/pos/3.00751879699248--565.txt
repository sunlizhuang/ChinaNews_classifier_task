The World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, which started in the summer of 1971 as a management retreat for European executives has, in its 50th year, morphed into an aspirational, world changing idea shop. It has grown from less than 500 mostly business attendees then, to currently more than 3000 delegates from the world of business, politics, philanthropy and the arts!

I first went to Davos in 2000, as a part of the World Economic Forum’s Global Leaders for Tomorrow initiative, where 100-odd young people were invited every year. This programme – since renamed Young Global Leaders – endeavoured to create a diverse peer group of change agents. I recall the first year was awe inspiring: from the personalities who attended to the topics that were debated to the informality of the place.

On our very first day in 2000, after an early morning session on technology, I found my wife holding forth with Bill Gates, Nicholas Negroponte and Norio Ohga. Gates was talking about the anti-trust issues that Microsoft had encountered two years earlier. Negroponte pointed out that MIT Media Lab’s research had shown how the internet could make giants like Microsoft and Sony into legacy players. Norio Ohga was worrying about how to retain Sony’s magic amidst rapid change. It was an off-the-charts experience!

There are many Davos traditions, big and small. The opening act comprises The Crystal Awards, given to leading artists and cultural figures who inspire change. This year it includes Deepika Padukone and Chinese dancer Jin Xing. The main speaker the next morning is normally a head of state. Two years ago, it was Narendra Modi. This year it’s Donald Trump. My personal favourite event is the dinner with Nobel Laureates, an incredibly difficult dinner to get into because of first-come first-serve sign up and a 50-people seating capacity limit. I have been fortunate to be able to go for this for the past many years and this year I look forward to interacting with economists Robert Shiller and Joseph Stiglitz as well as physicist Brian Schmidt.

Davos is known for high caliber private functions. George Soros hosts a dinner which is much sought after. Rahul Bajaj hosts a nightcap, where, if you don’t drink, he forces you to have hot chocolate in a one foot tall beer glass. It’s happened to me! E&Y and Forbes host a reception to celebrate the “100 Most Powerful Women”. Countries compete to host policy breakfasts and cultural evenings to enhance their soft power. And there is DJ Solomon, making you groove till the wee hours of the morning. He is extraordinarily skilled, especially since his day job is that of the Chairman of Goldman Sachs!

It’s not all fun and games. The morning sessions start at 8.15am. And there are private breakfast sessions before that. The agenda ranges from broad themes like economics, business, politics, and technology; to topical ones like climate change, personalised medicine and the trade war; to esoteric ones like happiness, veganism or singing. Most of the popular talks are live streamed for the benefit of those who want to see it while having a cappuccino. Additionally, because of the critical mass, people find that Davos is an efficient place for business meetings. Companies like Alibaba and Reliance have full meeting room facilities. I find that I spend almost a third of my time in one-on-one meetings.

The World Economic Forum’s USP is its ability to draw experts in diverse fields. Amidst this year’s star cast, the leading attraction for me is Greta Thunberg, who is going to be at two sessions and a dinner. I am looking forward to hearing Israeli historian Yuval Harari, whose extrapolations of the world of the future are both promising and eerie. I had dinner with him in Mumbai two years ago, and it’s amazing how he connects the dots. Because geopolitics is back in fashion, I am keen to hear Gideon Rose, editor of Foreign Affairs, who’s take on the current world order will be insightful.

Davos makes you think. Last year, Prince William interviewed natural historian and documentary film maker David Attenborough. Not the other way round. They spoke about the environment. The topic is old but David Attenborough’s perspective and passion added a new dimension. The discussion culminated with a five minute capsule from Attenborough’s Our Planet, an eight-film Netflix series. It showed the violent melting of arctic ice caps and the devastation it was causing. If an image is a thousand words, Attenborough’s film was a million words. It’s difficult not to be a climate activist after seeing his work in Davos.

The “Davos Man” – a term used because only one in five participants is a woman – is often maligned for being in an intellectual bubble. Critics say that the Davos agenda is a lagging indicator of the state of the world. David Wallace-Wells calls the Davos experience a useful exchange of creative ideas but also an “orgy of plutocratic comity”. Davos is all that. And more. If you believe in the power of ideas and if you have the physical and cognitive stamina for fifteen hours of daily stimulation, five days in Davos is time well spent.
