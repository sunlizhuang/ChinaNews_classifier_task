Theni: On the eve of Trump's maiden visit to India, social media has been abuzz with reactions and messages. While many welcome gestures have been written on social media, an artist from Theni in Tamil Nadu has prepared perhaps the most creative welcome gift for the US President.

M Elanchrzian, who happens to be a fruit and vegetable carving artist, has carved images of Donald Trump and Narendra Modi on watermelon as a welcome gesture. He took about two hours to carve the images, and also intricately added an image of the Taj Mahal in the background.

"I am happy that in his two-day visit Trump will get to know about our country's heritage and culture. It took me nearly two hours to carve out the images of Trump and Modi with the Taj Mahal in the background," Elanchezian told ANI.

Elanchezian had in the past carved out images of PM Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping on watermelon when the two leaders had visited Tamil Nadu in 2019 as part of a two-day informal summit.

US President Donald Trump will be visiting India on February 24 and 25 at the invitation of PM Narendra Modi. Trump will be accompanied by a high-level delegation including First Lady Melania Trump, daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.

Trump and his family are expected to arrive at Sardar Vallabhai Patel International airport in Ahmedabad on the morning of February 24, where he would be personally received by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

A 22-km roadshow will commence after the landing, following which Trump is likely to spend some time in Sabarmati Ashram. However, he is likely to cut short his stay in Ahmedabad to accommodate his likely visit to Agra and Delhi, said sources.
