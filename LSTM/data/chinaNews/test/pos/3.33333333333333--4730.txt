At the invitation of President Filipe Jacinto Nyusi of the Republic of Mozambique, Cai Dafeng, Special Envoy of President Xi Jinping and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, will attend President Nyusi's inauguration ceremony on January 15 in Maputo, Mozambique.

Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng and Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Takeo Akiba will hold the 15th round of China-Japan Strategic Dialogue on January 14 in Xi'an, as agreed by both sides. The two sides will exchange views on bilateral ties and regional and international issues of mutual interest.

China-Japan Strategic Dialogue is an important platform for the two foreign ministries to conduct high-level strategic communication. At present, China-Japan relations are improving and developing with a sound momentum. China hopes that through the new round of dialogue, the two sides will further consolidate consensus, enhance mutual trust and create favorable conditions to implement major bilateral political agenda and boost bilateral relations.

Q: Do you have information on who is going with Vice Premier Liu He to Washington next week and on what day will the phase one trade deal be signed?

A: The spokesperson of the Ministry of Commerce responded to similar questions at a press briefing yesterday. I have nothing to update you at the moment.

Q: A question on the signing of the phase one trade deal between China and the US. As I recall, after the two presidents met in Argentina, there was a press conference held by the Chinese side where State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi briefed us about the meeting. I wonder if there is similar press arrangement for Vice Premier Liu He's visit to the US this time?

A: I'd like to quote the Ministry of Commerce's press release yesterday, as you may recall, "The two teams are in close communication regarding specific arrangements of the signing of the deal." I believe "specific arrangements" cover everything necessary including those relating to the press. We will let you know if there is any new information on that.

Q: Does the date and venue of the 15th China-Japan Strategic Dialogue bear any special significance? Is the fifth political document between China and Japan on the agenda?

A: On the fifth political document you asked about, I don't have anything for you at the moment.

As to the date and venue of the 15th China-Japan Strategic Dialogue, I understand it was decided by both sides.
