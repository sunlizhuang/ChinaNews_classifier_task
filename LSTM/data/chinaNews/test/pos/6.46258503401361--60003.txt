CANTON – The Local Food Advisory Group is hosting the second annual Local Food Winter Social on Monday, Feb. 10.

This free event is an opportunity for producers, buyers, entrepreneurs, and advocates to contribute and learn about new initiatives around the region.

The committee members will share food system activities and facilitate interactive breakout sessions to envision future programming and allow others to communicate about their efforts.

The advisory group is affiliated with Cornell Cooperative Extension of St. Lawrence County and is comprised of food system practitioners working in various capacities across the local food system.

“Experiencing wintertime in the North Country is like training for an endurance sport,” said Flip Filippi, Extension Local Food Program leader. “It’s important to keep your goals in mind while also remembering to celebrate milestone achievements. We host this event in an effort to stay on track with strengthening the food system for all, while also enjoying good company and catching up with others passionate about maintaining a vibrant food culture in the region.”

Local food can be enjoyed throughout the night and posters and other educational materials related to local food will be displayed.
