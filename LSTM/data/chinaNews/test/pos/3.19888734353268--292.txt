The city of Mangalore has retained its old-world charm, and is a favourite among tourists for its pristine beaches, temples and authentic seafood. If you’re planning a visit here, you’ll want to make sure that you don’t miss out on tasting the best of the local Mangalorean cuisine. Vogue spoke to Aysha Tanya of The Goya Journal for her recommendations of all the restaurants she loves to visit when she’s there, and also added a few of our own to the list.
