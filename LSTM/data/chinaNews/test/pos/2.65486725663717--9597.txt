Ringwald Theatre artistic director and co-founder Joe Bailey is taking the stage solo this month in new comedy “BRIGHT COLORS AND BOLD PATTERNS,” a one-man show about a gay wedding and a very ticked-off wedding guest. Its central character, Gerry, has just arrived in Palm Springs for the nuptials of two friends, and he’s more than a little annoyed by the snooty request that guests refrain from dressing in bright colors and bold patterns. As he settles in poolside with a cocktail, Gerry delivers hilarious and sometimes biting reflections on what it means to be gay in 21st-century America.

Through Jan. 27, Ringwald Theatre, Ferndale. theringwald.com. $20, $10 Mondays.
