Lovell says the window for the school division to avoid losing money on flights and other expenses is closing very rapidly, forcing them to make a decision sooner rather than later.

Additionally up in the air is an inbound trip of students from China to central Alberta scheduled for this April. There are currently no students from China at Wolf Creek schools, Lovell says.

“It’s a very fluid situation, and we recognize that the safety of our staff and students is always of the highest priority,” he adds. “We certainly are keeping a close watch on the Canadian government’s information and also from Alberta Health, so there’s lots of consultation.”

Lovell says there have been no concerns brought to him directly from students, staff or parents, but notes there is a trust which exists that those parties will be kept apprised of the situation.

Students planning to attend each pay around $2000 for the trip, with the rest subsidized. Those students are all part of an International Learning Program run by the division.

Lovell notes that he has been authorized by the board of trustees — which would normally make decisions on international travel — to make changes himself, if necessary.

Red Deer Public Schools, Red Deer Catholic Regional Schools, and Chinook’s Edge School Division all tell rdnewsNOW they do not have trips planned to China or that region in the near future.

Red Deer Catholic has an exchange trip to Japan planned for 2021.
