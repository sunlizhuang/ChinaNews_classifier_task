SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 4, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- This year, the Chinaâ€“United States trade war is an ongoing economic conflict between the world's two largest national economies. Despite this, cities in China and the United States have partnered together to create "Two Cities/One Book", a collaborative project between San Francisco and Shanghai. Over the past several years, San Francisco Public Library worked with the Shanghai Pudong Library to produce the book, which presents an opportunity for San Franciscans to read and discuss the same book, at the same time, as residents from its sister city of Shanghai. People's Daily Online West USA visited the San Francisco Public Library to learn more about the book as part of a documentary on Oct. 23, 2019.
