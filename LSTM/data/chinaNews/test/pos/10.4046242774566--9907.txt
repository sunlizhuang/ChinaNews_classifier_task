New York, NY— January 15, 2020 — Last year, Marvel joined forces with Wacom, a company popular with artists for their state-of-the-art graphic tablets, to conduct a nationwide talent search throughout China. The results of this endeavor will be our upcoming Chinese New Year variant covers, the first of which can be seen below!

“It was a thrill for me to visit art schools and conventions around China last year as part of this massive talent search!” says Editor-in-Chief CB Cebulski. “We reviewed hundreds of submissions and these covers are by the artists whose unique visual styles we felt best captured the Marvel characters. We hope fans love them as much as we do as Marvel continues our global approach to discovering diverse artistic voices!”

First up, we have the talented artist Jie Yuan who takes over your favorite Spider-Man titles with three connecting covers, featuring a who’s who of your favorite Spider-Man characters from Miles Morales to Spider-Gwen to Peter Parker himself. Take a look at these awesome variant covers below and be on the lookout for more cover reveals from other artists who Marvel and Wacom found during this exciting creative initiative!

You can pick up these covers in your local comic shop on February 12th. Retailers, don’t forget to order your copies before Monday, January 20th!
