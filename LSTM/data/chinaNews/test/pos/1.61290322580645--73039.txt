I live near Toronto’s original Chinatown. (Mass immigration has created a couple of others, but this is the downtown one.) Today, Canada Day (sort of like Independence Day) there was a parade of patriotic Chinese-Canadians, with Chinese New Year style dragons, various cultural associations, a small group from Canada’s Conservative Party, and some nice looking girls in cheongsams twirling parasols as form of cultural display.

The parasol is still used in real life by Chinese ladies, who have a horror of turning brown from the sun. I’ve seen an elderly lady holding up an ordinary Western umbrella on a sunny day.

Everything was very orderly. There was chanting and drum-beating, which was done quietly, if you can believe that. I tried hard to think bad thoughts about immigration, but when a nice old Chinese lady wearing a t-shirt saying “I love Canada” smiled at me and handed me a small paper Canadian flag, it was impossible not to smile myself.

However...the same mass immigration that’s furnished Toronto with multiple Chinatowns has furnished it with a Little India and—uh, oh!–a Little Jamaica.

And as I looked at this nice, positive immigration, with many shirts saying “I love Canada”, I remembered “The Talk” by John Derbyshire. I was totally safe at this nice Chinese parade, even though white Canadians like me might have made up 10 percent of the crowd.

There’s another parade in my home town called Caribana, which used to be about half a mile from where the Chinese parade happened, and it’s a largely Jamaican parade.—which usually results in someone getting shot.

John Derbyshire wrote, in the article that got him fired, that he’d advise his children to

10a) Avoid concentrations of blacks not all known to you personally. (10b) Stay out of heavily black neighborhoods. (10c) If planning a trip to a beach or amusement park at some date, find out whether it is likely to be swamped with blacks on that date (neglect of that one got me the closest I have ever gotten to death by gunshot). (10d) Do not attend events likely to draw a lot of blacks. (10e) If you are at some public event at which the number of blacks suddenly swells, leave as quickly as possible.

If I had found myself at Toronto’s Caribana parade, my first priority would have been to exfiltrate. And no-one, I guarantee you, would have been wearing t-shirts that said “I love Canada”.

"Johnny Canuck" was born in Canada so long ago that he remembers when the flag of Canada was the Union Jack.
