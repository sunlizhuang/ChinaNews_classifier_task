Pope Francis needed an experienced man to represent him in France in place of the now-retired Archbishop Luigi Ventura. The 75-year-old stepped down last month on health grounds after a 10-year term that ended with accusations that he sexually assaulted various young men.

As his replacement, the pope on Jan. 11 chose Archbishop Celestino Migliore, former nuncio to Russia and one of the Holy See's best diplomats. Interestingly, "migliore" actually means "best" in Italian.

"The right choice," says a French priest in Rome who worked with Migliore when the nuncio served as the Holy See's Permanent Observer at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg (1992-1995) and under-secretary for relations with states (1995-2002).

The priest described him as a warm-hearted man, but strong willed man.

"He's one of our most open-minded, clear and friendly diplomats," the priest added.

Along with the late Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran, Archbishop Migliore was in charge of "the Asian countries that do not have diplomatic relations with the Holy See": North Korea, Vietnam and China.

"A straightforward and friendly diplomat," is how former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, Jim Nicholson, described Migliore in 2002 when the archbishop represented the Holy See at the United Nations.

Ties with Moscow

Benedict XVI named Migliore nuncio to Poland in 2010. In that post the archbishop was forced to resolve several scandals that his predecessor mishandled.

Then when he served in Moscow, he helped maintain cordial relations between Russia and the Holy See during the Ukrainian crisis.

Migliore reportedly convinced Russian Present Vladimir Putin to legally recognize the Catholic Church in the annexed Crimea.

"He is a diplomat who knows how to make the right noises. He is also open-minded and attentive to people," a Russian priest said of the 67-year-old archbishop.

As it turns out, Migliore was born in Cuneo, only a few kilometers from France and he speaks French well.

The French government readily gave its required agreement to his appointment, seeking to close the chapter on Luigi Ventura whose diplomatic immunity the Holy See previously lifted.

Archbishop Migliore is expected to arrive in Paris in the coming weeks.
