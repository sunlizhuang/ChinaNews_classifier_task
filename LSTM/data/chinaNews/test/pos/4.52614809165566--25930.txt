National Health Commission to hold daily briefings from Monday. Local health officials in affected areas to do the same. (#China criticized for lack of transparency. More briefings better but when asked about possible underreporting, NHC chief talked # cases but didn‚Äôt answer.ü§î) ‚Äî Eunice Yoon (@onlyyoontv) January 26, 2020

Mandatory reminder: What I‚Äôm posting here is what catches my eye, mostly from twitter. There‚Äôs (predictably) a ton of paranoid / xenophobic conspiracy theories (sample here from the NYPost, reposting from the Daily Mail, two major Western media outlets with established histories of hyping Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt).

AFP's reporters ON THE GROUND in Wuhan haven't seen any dead bodies in the streets of the city. But Twitter is here for the rumors of the zombie apocalypse. https://t.co/BtNshOusV7 ‚Äî Laurent Thomet Âç¢È∏ø (@LThometAFP) January 25, 2020

I worry about two things: viral infection through crowded hospitals and undertrained/exhausted/underequipped health workers, and excess deaths from treatable conditions as the system struggles to cope and transport links are broken. ‚Äî James Palmer (@BeijingPalmer) January 24, 2020

Totally. There can be both a massive coverup/China is lying about the numbers AND no need for global panic. The two can coexist. ‚Äî Melissa Chan (@melissakchan) January 24, 2020

It‚Äôs being reported that the State Department will evacuate some U.S. citizens, but only the paywalled Wall Street Journal seems to have much detail so far.

Interested U.S. citizens in possession of valid passports should contact [email protected] ‚ÄúIf there is insufficient ability to transport everyone who expresses interest, priority will be given to individuals at greater risk from coronavirus.‚Äù https://t.co/PDV5SPq7Cw ‚Äî Eunice Yoon (@onlyyoontv) January 26, 2020

China MOFA confirms the US proposal. ‚ÄúIn accordance with international practice and relevant Chinese epidemic prevention regulations, China has made corresponding arrangements to provide necessary assistance and convenience.‚Äù #WuhanCoronavirus https://t.co/0k82b7MaOI ‚Äî Olivia Qi Zhang (@zhang_qiii) January 26, 2020





Not a good time for tourist visits:

The decision applies to travel agencies and online platforms like Trip $TCOM. Lack of clarity about refunds, etc. Says ‚Äútourists and agencies can negotiate a solution according to their contracts.‚Äù Those who have already departed are allowed to finish their trips. #China ‚Äî Eunice Yoon (@onlyyoontv) January 25, 2020

The customs of the country:

#China imposes restrictions for travel to Beijing. Capital to suspend all inter-provincial road passenger transport from Sunday to curb spread of #Wuhanvirus, state media quote city authorities. (Means buses only -not private cars or trains. All transport within city allowed.) ‚Äî Eunice Yoon (@onlyyoontv) January 25, 2020

when Chinese get sick, they often make trip to a big city for care because health care system is lacking esp. in provinces. Beijing hospitals have best reputation. So #China likely trying to prevent flood of #coronavirus patients from showing up (which would be common practice.) ‚Äî Eunice Yoon (@onlyyoontv) January 25, 2020

Good news, bad news:

A potential vaccine to prevent the spreading coronavirus could move into early-stage human testing in the next three months, the NIH's infectious disease chief said. https://t.co/1A6SmmaVpe ‚Äî Bloomberg Law (@BLaw) January 26, 2020

Unlike #SARS, the coronavirus can infect people even if its carrier shows little or no symptom: Ma Xiaowei, head of the National Health Commission #WuhanCoronavirus https://t.co/Cx2zH1KXuW ‚Äî Global Times (@globaltimesnews) January 26, 2020

BE AFRAID BE‚Ä¶ reasonably sensible, okay?

BREAKING: The OC Health Care Agency‚Äôs Communicable Disease Control Division has received confirmation from the CDC that a traveler to Orange County from China has tested positive for the novel coronavirus. https://t.co/F7TDnKJAEz ‚Äî CBS Los Angeles (@CBSLA) January 26, 2020

At the best of times, the Chinese government is considered less than transparent, not least by its own citizens‚Ä¶

This is a cry for help when the government and the system has failed the citizens of Wuhan miserably. #CoronaOutbreak #coronavirus #WuhanCoronavirus pic.twitter.com/JvYhrpLpcO ‚Äî ash (@ashtually) January 26, 2020
