The government is planning to enter into memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four countries, for the promotion of tourism.



The government has received the Cabinet approval to sign agreements with China, Iraq, Pakistan and Estonia.



The government aims to sign MoUs with South Africa and Georgia in the future.



MoUs have already been signed with India, Thailand, the Seychelles, Poland, Tajikistan, Malaysia, Australia, Russia, South Korea and the Philippines.



The government also plans to appoint destination marketing and representative agencies centred around the top tourist-attracting European countries and India, the Middle East region, Russia and Ukraine. It is also expected to implement tourism promotion programmes proposed by the Sri Lankan missions in the respective countries.
