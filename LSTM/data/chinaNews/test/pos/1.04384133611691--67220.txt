While many companies cancelled their MWC events due to the coronavirus outbreak, Xiaomi has made an announcement that it will stick to its original plan. The company tweeted a detailed list of precautions it will take to ensure the safety of its employees and the visitors to its booth.

For presentations at the Xiaomi booth, the company will bring in employees from its European offices (after checking that they have shown no symptoms for 14 days). All displayed products will be frequently disinfected, following GSMA guidelines.

For employees and senior staff coming out of China, Xiaomi will ensure that they left the country at least 14 days before attending the event at the MWC and that they show no symptoms.

Xiaomi will unveil new smartphones and a variety of other smart gadgets on February 23. This includes the global launch of the Xiaomi Mi 10 and Mi 10 Pro (the phones will be unveiled in China first a couple of days from now). The Mi 10 flagships and other new gadgets will be available at Xiaomi's booth between February 24 and 27.

Here is Xiaomi's message to the fans and media:
