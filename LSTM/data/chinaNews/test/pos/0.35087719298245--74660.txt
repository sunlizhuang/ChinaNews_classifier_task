Treatment

More Filipino crew members of a Japanese cruise ship are infected with COVID-19. Beijing approved the first drug to fight COVID-19. Macau is to reopen its casinos. Will the country’s travel ban on Macau, Hong Kong and mainland China be lifted any time soon for the sake of OFWs?

'Pastillas'

Sen. Risa Hontiveros exposed during a Senate hearing a so-called “pastillas” scam among airport immigration officials. Corrupt immigrations officials allegedly receive bribes from Chinese nationals for seamless entry into the country. The officials received P10,000 each in bills rolled into bond paper, hence the reference to “pastillas,” a sweet soft candy wrapped in bond paper. During the hearing, immigration officials said they’ve never heard of the scam but will investigate.

Dilly-daly

Not off the hook

The Palace said Police Lt. Col. Jovie Espenido isn’t off the hook after his name was included in the narco list. President Duterte said he would support Espenido. But Presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo said Duterte could have a change of heart regarding Espenido.
