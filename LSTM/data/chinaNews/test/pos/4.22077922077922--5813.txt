Jamie Young Company, the Southern California-based provider of lighting, accent furniture, and home accessories, recently announced the introduced of their new collection for January 2020 with 75 items.

The design-duo and founders, Jamie Young Jeter and David Jeter of the Jamie Young Company, are influenced by their joint passion to travel and discover the world. In the past year, Jamie and David visited India, Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam, China, and the Philippines in their continuous endeavor to discover the most beautiful ways of creating unique home furnishings.





The 2020 product introductions were inspired by cultural traditions and artisanship from the several countries the couple visited throughout Eastern Asia and feature a variety of new finishes and techniques. This introduction contains an assortment of categories welcoming beautiful new shapes, materials, and stains. New table lamps handcrafted from ceramic include finishes of layered colors of reactive glass, antique silver and pewter, and natural hide. The portable lighting collection offers complementing beautiful natural linen shades. As the company continues to amplify their fixture collection, new pieces embrace finishes of natural woven materials and hand finished brass metals, including antique glass chandeliers with additional shapes and sizes.



“Our new accessories are all about scale and texture using natural materials in ceramic, glass, marble and wood. All our glass pieces are works of art, individually mouth-blown with thick layers of different shards of colored glass. Our new wood accents are an extension of our popular large Wooden Vases adding new shapes and stained darer finishes.”
