This year, three Asean member states - Indonesia, Myanmar and Vietnam - will mark 70 years of diplomatic ties with China. That Chinese President Xi Jinping chose Myanmar first to celebrate the occasion says much about what is at stake in bilateral relations. It is also a reflection of the state of play of Chinese relations with key countries in South-east Asia. Given their history, China and Vietnam can best be described as frenemies. Beijing's ties with Jakarta have hit a rough patch of late over maritime rights. Myanmar, however, offers many open doors for a China looking for closer ties in a region increasingly wary of its growing economic and political clout. There are mutual benefits for both as Mr Xi arrived yesterday bearing investment pledges worth billions. These include a high-speed rail line, border industrial zones and the US$1.3 billion (S$1.75 billion) Kyaukphyu port in Rakhine state that will provide China with a gateway to the Indian Ocean. The port is also the centrepiece of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, part of Mr Xi's signature Belt and Road Initiative.

Chinese friendship and money could not come at a better time for Myanmar, beset by multiple insurgencies and shunned by erstwhile allies and Western investors because of the Rohingya crisis. The United Nation's top court is scheduled to deliver its decision next week on whether emergency measures should be imposed on Myanmar over alleged genocide against its Rohingya Muslims. China has stood by a beleaguered Myanmar at the UN. Beijing's support also helps Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her party in an election year, making it possible for them to offer voters the prospect of a better future arising from the promised Chinese bounty. What China offers is impressive. The improved connectivity between its Yunnan province and the port in Rakhine, for instance, will potentially boost trade and create jobs in the troubled state.
