LUSAKA, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambians have expressed an interest in a Chinese cultural display at the 2020 Chinese Spring Festival in Zambia.

The Zambians said the display was awesome and hoped that more of such displays could be held by the Chinese so that local people could learn more.

"This is awesome and I am glad I am seeing it live. We just used to watch the things on television but today I am glad that I am here to see the displays," Oliver Kasanda, a resident of Lusaka, the Zambian capital told Xinhua.

He said China needs to help Zambia on how to conduct cultural displays, adding that this will go a long way in promoting cultural exchanges between the two countries.

James Kalawizi, another Lusaka resident said the festival was a display of the rich Chinese culture and that Zambia has a lot to learn from China in terms of preserving the culture.

He said Zambians were keen to learn from China's experience and appealed to the Chinese embassy to consider setting up a cultural center in Zambia.

"It is good that the holding of such events are deepening the relation between the two countries," he said.

Regina Mwanza, who was attending the Spring Festival for the first time, expressed delight at the display, adding that the Chinese people have shown that they have a rich cultural background.■
