LETTERS: THE maritime areas of Malaysia feature busy sea lanes of communication that include the Straits of Malacca, the South China Sea, the Sulu Sea and the Sulawesi Seas.

These maritime areas are gateways for international trade flows that impinge significantly on the nation’s economic life.

To this end, the government has deployed various policies and infrastructure projects aimed at ensuring Malaysia’s predominance as a major maritime nation.

In November last year, Malaysia retained its seat at the International Maritime Council, a reflection of its commitment towards building a robust and dynamic international community.

It is also a significant platform as envisioned by Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad at the Langkawi International Maritime and Aviation 2019 exhibition for achieving the nation’s aspirations towards being a major partner in the international maritime community.

Along these lines, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced plans to establish a Maritime Centre of Excellence 2020 to promote Malaysia’s commitment towards the sea and its well-being.

This effort will complement the role agencies such as the Maritime Institute of Malaysia, established in 1993 under the auspices of the Prime Minister’s Department and then from 1995 under the Ministry of Transport, in promoting Malaysia’s maritime agenda and to advise the government on related issues in a wholistic and integrated manner.

Malaysia’s maritime strategic priorities comprise two key elements. One involves managing both national and international affairs.

Its foreign policy revolves around a comprehensive approach to protect its sovereignty and ensure that external entities will not compromise or threaten the well-being of the country.

At the same time, Malaysia strongly promotes cooperation as the basis for stability in the conduct of its international affairs especially its relations with immediate neighbours as well as other countries.

The nation’s Maritime Security Outlook 2020 on regional affairs stressed that the South China Sea remained a priority on the security front.

In this area, main policy directions have been posited.

First, in September last year, Malaysia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs published its Foreign Policy Framework of New Malaysia themed Change in Continuity.

The document established the nation’s foreign policy priorities especially in regard to its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.

It highlighted that issues relating to the South China Sea are based on close cooperation with Asean member states and the major powers and in having a voice on emerging international matters including security in the South China Sea.

The South China Sea has been identified as a potential flashpoint that required judicious handling.

Disputes in the area should be settled through peaceful means using a rule-based approach and universally-recognised principles of international law such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and other international arbitration.

Diverging and broad range of maritime matters will need constant attention from various ministries, such as the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Defence, more so now in the ever challenging and complex geo-strategic convergence in regions like the Straits of Malacca and the South China Sea.
