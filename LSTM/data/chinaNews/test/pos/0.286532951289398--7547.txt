The 19th council of heads of government of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) will be hosted by India later this year. This would be the first high-level meeting of the SCO that would be organised here since India’s admission to the eight-member grouping.

SCO General Secretary on a visit to New Delhi on Monday said, The SCO Heads of Government meeting will be held in India in the second half in autumn. All member states were very happy with the decision. There is huge potential and India can play a very positive role.

The economic and security bloc which initially comprised of China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, included India and Pakistan in 2017. India took over the presidency of the heads of government’ meeting last year and it was announced in the 18th meeting of the SCO’s Council of heads of government-held in Tashkent in 2019.

By including India, our organisation has perhaps united half the population of the world and 60 percent of the territory of Eurasia. That is why it is very important that India host such an event, said Secretary-General Vladimir Norov.

The big question is who will represent Pakistan at the meet. In India, the Prime Minister attends the Heads of State’ since President Putin, President Xi Jinping and the others attend that meeting. The Heads of State’ meet is normally attended by the foreign minister or senior cabinet minister.

Since the meeting is going to be held in India and it is the first big event that India will be hosting, we will have to wait and see if Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself will play host.

Meanwhile, Pakistan will have to decide whether its participation will be at the Prime Minister-level or someone else will represent the government in India. The SCO, which has its headquarters in Beijing, holds summits of heads of states as well as heads of government meetings annually in member countries. The heads of state meet for 2020 will be held in St. Petersburg, Russia.
