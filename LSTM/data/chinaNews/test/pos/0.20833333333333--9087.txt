ARIES (March 21-April 19): A late sun/moon aspect suggests that you could end the day on a sour or stressful note, and some cross words with a colleague or friend are likely to have you smoldering for longer than is necessary. Don’t overreact; aim to defuse tensions. End the day on a positive note instead!

TAURUS (April 20-May 20): You might find that you need to exert a little self-discipline, thanks to Mars. Certain plans might need some revising, but a tendency to flit from one solution to the other indicates that you could end up getting nowhere. You may need to restore some much needed balance!

GEMINI (May 21-June 20): You could find that you’re rather torn; the planetary aspects suggest that while you may feel more secure and content with pushing the proverbial boat right out, there’ll be a tiny part of you a little tempted to take the more risk-averse route; go with your inner voice on this one, Gemini!

CANCER (June 21-July 22): A chance to sit down at some point during the day with someone close to you will establish a positive start to the week. Whether it’s with a good friend or with a partner the planets are suggesting that something needs airing or resolving, and today’s the day to do it!

LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Today the moon is likely to have you eager to tackle something within the home. However, you could find that an overly adventurous or bold sense of style will be the main block to success. Don’t bite off more than you can chew, plan ahead, and do ask for advice!

VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): The late appearing sun/moon aspect may temporarily disrupt any romantic developments, especially given the less than helpful position of Mars right now. Singles might be inclined to rather misjudge a situation with someone, while attached Virgos will need to apply a little sensitivity!

LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Go easy on the spending; a challenging Mars/Venus aspect suggests a brief desire to offset a moment of boredom with a bit of impulse-buying. Things that you don’t really want or need will seem to call to you. Resist the temptation to blow your budget and wait a couple of days!

SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): You’ll need to be a little firm with yourself; otherwise you could end up with unfinished assignments or chores hanging over you. A tendency to be a little too laid back about pressing concerns will rebound on you. Just put the fun and games on hold until you’re on top of everything!

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): The evening is likely to bring one or two minor challenges in the form of a friend in need, looking for a sympathetic shoulder. Normally you’d have plenty of time for them, but your flagging energy levels might be a hindrance. Pace yourself through the daytime hours!

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Overall you should have a fairly easy-going day; the moon’s influence will wane enough to restore some balance, at least until the evening. That said; don’t get too hung up on trying to unearth a piece of information; it will become clear in good time, most likely after the weekend!

AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): It is possible that an event or even a person could challenge your balanced or sensible approach, causing you a bit of a headache. However, this upset is unlikely to be a deliberate attempt to undermine you; it’s more likely to be based on thoughtlessness. Just be prepared to say no!

PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Cash matters aren’t going to look too fabulous, thanks to the moon lingering in Aries. It’s possible that disappointing news related to your finances won’t become apparent until the late afternoon, so resist the impulse to rush straight to the mall or the nearest salon, and trust a friend’s more objective view!

FOR THOSE OF US BORN ON THIS DAY: Happy Birthday! This is going to be a very eventful year with some real surprises thrown in along the way. As the next year begins you may well think that the main focus is going to be your career of school work. However, as the year progresses you will be swept away by a major romantic interest! Things are likely to be somewhat up and down and you will have to work hard to make this relationship succeed. Keep at it though and you will be really glad that you did. Family members will come round to your way of thinking eventually! Towards the end of the year all sorts of different aspects of your life will start to come together with a surprising feeling of predestination and even destiny!

CELEBRITY GOSSIP: Natasha Oakley has managed to achieve fame by simply keeping a blog in which she wears a different bikini each day. This might sound ridiculous but it has worked for Natasha, who is now earning serious money as a model. However, the planets indicate that she may be about to make a foolish mistake and risk it all!
