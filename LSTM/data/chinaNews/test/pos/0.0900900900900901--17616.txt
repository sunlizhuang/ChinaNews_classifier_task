Despite vague promises made at the June 2018 summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un to denuclearize, numerous reports have since confirmed the reality that North Korea is covertly proceeding with the development of nuclear warheads and delivery systems. This includes continued construction of a second ballistic-missile submarine as well as accelerated production of enriched uranium. As U.S.–North Korea nuclear negotiations have stalled, with working-level talks in October ending fruitlessly, the relations between North and South Korea have also strained despite offers of talks by the South. North Korea has rejected the proposal and accused South Korea of "double-dealing behavior," also warning that any resumption of the planned U.S.–South Korean military drills would essentially end further nuclear negotiations.

Meanwhile, Kim Jong-un has officially visited China four times in the past two years and China's economic assistance to North Korea accounts for about half of all Chinese foreign aid. But while Beijing appears willing to condemn its neighbor's nuclear developments, its policies towards North Korea have remained status quo and not served as a deterrent for North Korea to take steps towards denuclearizing.

As such, rising geopolitical tensions on the peninsula and in the region are among the top concerns of security analysts across the globe. How can the U.S. and international community incentivize North Korea to return to the table for nuclear talks? What roles do other regional countries such as China play in averting potential conflict? Join Asia Society Texas Center as experts discuss the security challenges and associated risks on the Korean peninsula.
