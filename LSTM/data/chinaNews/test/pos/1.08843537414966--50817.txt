Key Highlights During Saturday's Budget speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the government was working on a scheme to boost local electronics production, but said details would be unveiled later.

The Centre is readying a Rs 45,000-crore fund to ensure large companies such as Apple, Samsung Foxconn and Wistron bring their global supply chains to India.

Out of the Rs 45,000-crore fund, about Rs 41,000 crore would be given to companies based on a production-linked incentive (PLI) criteria.

New Delhi: In order to make India a global hub for electronics manufacturing and create 2 lakh jobs over the next five years, the Centre is readying a Rs 45,000-crore fund to ensure large companies such as Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and contract manufacturers like Foxconn and Wistron bring their global supply chains to India.

Out of the Rs 45,000-crore fund, about Rs 41,000 crore would be given to companies based on a production-linked incentive (PLI) criteria, and the remaining Rs 4,000 crore would be offered under a proposed capital subsidy, or reimbursement, scheme. This proposed scheme will replace the popular Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS), the Economic Times said in a report. “An inter-ministerial note (on this) has been floated,” the ET report quoted a senior government official as saying.

“The government expects the PLI scheme to generate over 2 lakh jobs, exports of over Rs 5 lakh crore and direct tax revenue of close to Rs 5,000 crore, over a period of five years,” the official told the business daily.

The disbursement mechanism of the PLI scheme would most likely be similar to the duty credit scrip scheme under the current Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), which is being wound down by March 31. But details of the new scheme will be firmed up during inter-ministerial consultations, the above-mentioned officials said.

Worth mentioning here is that duty credit scrip is a certificate with certain monetary value that can be utilised for payment of customs duty.

Here, the government officials are trying to ensure that the new policy does not directly link the support to exports so that India remains compliant with World Trade Organisation guidelines. However, the govt wants to put in tough qualification criteria to ensure that the funds are not used by those who manufacture devices only for the local market.

The likes of Foxconn — the world’s largest contract manufacturer that also operates the biggest such facility for smartphones in India — as well as Samsung, Huawei, Vivo and Oppo together account for more than 80% of the $500-billion global mobile phone market.

During Saturday's Budget speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the government was working on a scheme to boost local electronics production, but said details would be unveiled later. The draft proposals have been sent to secretaries of revenue, expenditure, economic affairs, commerce, department for promotion of industry and internal trade, ministry of electronics & information technology (MeitY), Niti Aayog CEO and the Directorate General of Foreign Trade for their comments, the business daily mentioned.

“Given the imminent withdrawal of MEIS and limited relief provided by the proposed Remission of Duties or Taxes on Export Products (RoDTEP) in the electronics sector, there is a need to address manufacturing disabilities vis-à-vis China and Vietnam,” the official said, explaining the PLI scheme.

According to various industry studies, the policy support in Vietnam renders India uncompetitive by 10-12 percentage points and the disability of India compared to China lies between 19% and 23%.

To counter this, the PLI scheme would extend an incentive of 5-8% on incremental sales of goods manufactured in India and covered under target segments, which the government will notify. MEIS offers 4% duty credit scrips. Companies like Apple, Foxconn and market leader Xiaomi had been demanding more, to encourage them to make India their manufacturing hubs.

In order to maximise exports and value addition in India, eligibility of companies would be decided based on incremental job creation, incremental investment and incremental sales of manufactured goods.

“The (PLI) scheme will open for a period of three months initially, inviting applications. However, the disbursement of incentive for the approved applicants would continue for a period of five years, based on the response from the industry,” the publication quoted another official as saying.
