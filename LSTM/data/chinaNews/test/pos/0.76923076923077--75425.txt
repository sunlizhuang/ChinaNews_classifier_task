PHNOM PENH, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen on Tuesday applauded China for its efforts to contain the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), expressing his confidence in China to win the fight against the virus soon.

"We would like to congratulate the People's Republic of China on its efforts to contain the spread of the COVID-19, and we also thank China for taking care of Cambodian students there, including 23 in Wuhan city," he said in a speech during a graduation ceremony of nearly 2,000 students at the National Institute of Education here.

He also extended his profound condolences to the Chinese government and people over the loss of lives and wished the patients a speedy and full recovery.

On Monday, Sun Yanrong, deputy head of the China National Center for Biotechnology Development under the Ministry of Science and Technology, told a press conference that Chinese experts, based on the result of clinical trials, have confirmed that Chloroquine Phosphate, an antimalarial drug, has a certain curative effect on the COVID-19.

Hun Sen welcomed the news.

"If it is true and the (antimalarial) drug really can cure the patients, I think the difficult situation will be over in the near future, so we are really happy to hear this news," he said.

He hoped that China will soon win the fight against the virus, saying that China's rapid development is a boon not only for the Chinese, but also for the people around the world.
