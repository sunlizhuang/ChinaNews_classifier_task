Red is the color of celebrating the new year in China and it is also the color of fresh Cherries from Chile. On January 16, just on the eve of the lunar New Year, the Chilean Cherry Committee of the Chilean Fruit Exporters Association (ASOEX) teamed up with food delivery service Ele.me to hold the Harvest Your Red Moment and Deliver Happiness Together 2020 Chilean Cherry x Eleme Spring Shopping Festival Launch Ceremony. The event featured remarks by Juan José Vidal Wood, Trade Commissioner at the Shanghai office of ProChile; Charif Christian Carvajal, Marketing Director, Europe and Asia for ASOEX; and Mr. LIN Chun, who is responsible for new retail industry operations at Ele.me.

The Spring Festival celebration of the lunar New Year is the peak sales period for Chilean cherries in China, adding even more demand for an already popular product. According to Lin Chun of Ele.me, in order to satisfy consumer demand for Chilean cherries, Ele.me has added Cherries from Chile to the “100-Million Yuan Subsidy” program within its 2020 Spring Shopping Festival. The program works together with sellers on the Ele.me platform to subsidize sales of Cherries from Chile. The program will allow even more consumers to obtain “cherry freedom”—a newly coined phrase in China which signifies the freedom to eat cherries whenever one has the urge to do so. By purchasing cherries through the Ele.me platform, consumers receive speedy delivery, which helps preserve the quality of the fresh fruit and makes for an enjoyable eating experience.

“China is the primary market for exports of Cherries from Chile and cherries are an important component in the two countries’ flourishing economic relationship,” said Juan José Vidal Wood, Trade Commissioner at the Shanghai office of ProChile. “Cooperation with Ele.me will have a positive impact on the consumption and promotion of Chilean cherries in China.”

“We hope that through our cooperation with Ele.me, more consumers in China will be able to enjoy fresh, high-quality Cherries from Chile as part of their New Year celebrations and even onwards towards mid-february,” said Charif Christian Carvajal, Marketing Director, Europe and Asia for ASOEX.

Also present at the ceremony were Ele.me delivery drivers. Juan José Vidal Wood and Charif Christian Carvajal, acting on behalf of the Chilean Cherry Committee of ASOEX, presented the drivers with “Enjoy Your Red Moments” scarfs and thanked them for their diligence and hard work. Delivery of delicious fresh Cherries from Chile would be impossible without the quiet efforts of these drivers.

Exports of Chilean cherries are expected to set a new record for the 2019/20 season, rising from 180,000 tons last season to a projected 210,000 tons this season. Situated in the southern hemisphere, Chile will continue supplying fresh cherries to China beyond the Spring festival holiday and into February.
