Quzhou city in east China's Zhejiang province will hold a grand ritual on Feb. 4 in its Kecheng district to welcome the Start of Spring.



During the ceremony, a total of 24 overseas Chinese will be invited to join local residents for a series of activities, including paying tribute to the god of spring and land, and whipping the spring ox, as part of a time-honored ritual to carry on China's agricultural traditions.

The ritual ceremony dates back 1,000 years, and it has been formally held each year since 2005 in the village on the special day on the Chinese lunar calendar, signaling the start of the farming season. On this day, farmers perform the ritual to wish for a rich harvest.

The Start of Spring is one of 24 Solar Terms on the Chinese lunar calendar, representing 24 periods and climate-governing agricultural arrangements in ancient China. The Solar Terms were inscribed in the "Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity" by UNESCO in 2016.

A highlight of this year's ceremony will be the "Drone Light Show." About 200 luminous drones will perform the light show, presenting people with a unique high-tech experience during the traditional festival.
