AUCKLAND, New Zealand, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand and China have a maturing relationship, which is incredibly positive, said New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Saturday as local residents gathered together to celebrate the Chinese New Year Festival.

Speaking at the 2020 Chinese New Year Festival and Market Day event in Auckland, Ardern was optimistic about the relationship between New Zealand and China. She acknowledged that New Zealand-China relations are important and far reaching, and are going from strength to strength.

The Chinese New Year event, organized by Auckland Chinese Community Centre Inc., is an annual event that celebrates the Chinese New Year and has become an important cultural signature in multi-culture New Zealand.

"It is an example of multi-culturalism in action, as we see different communities coming together," said Ardern.

Chinese Ambassador to New Zealand Wu Xi believed that the Year of Rat, being the first in the Chinese zodiac, represents intelligence, wisdom and vitality.

"It also symbolizes the spirit of pioneering which lies in the people of both China and New Zealand. The spirit of pioneering is also the key to the success of China-New Zealand relations," said Wu.

The event was attended by thousands of local residents. Traditional Chinese performances, lion dances, art works and Chinese food have enriched the local celebration.

Anna-Maree Denby, a local New Zealander who came to the event for the first time, said her family enjoyed the event, particularly the Chinese calligraphy and paintings on display. Enditem
