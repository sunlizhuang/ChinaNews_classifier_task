The "Australia Forest Fire Contribution Relay" by BTS' Jimin fan club has been drawing attention from a lot of people. Recently, Australia is groaning in endless forest fires.

According to Australia's National Daily Newspaper, the National Forest Fire Protection Agency (RFS) in New South Wales said that it had designated Bateman's Bay, Wonbo and Badja, which are raging with three wildfires, as "no tourist areas." Forest fires, which have continued throughout Australia over the past few months, have left more than eight people dead, including three firefighters, four missing people and 1,300 homes destroyed.

On the southeastern coast of NSW, the damage in Kobago and Bateman's Bay areas is said to be the worst. The New South Wales state fire prevention agency issued an evacuation order for tourists on vacation in the forest fire area. It urged them to refrain from visiting until the situation calms down.

In this situation, many countries around the world and celebrities are giving Australia a helping hand. Amid these developments, BTS' Jimin Fanclub is voluntarily conducting a donation relay to help Australia. The reason why they participated is that he uploaded an image of the donation certificate and is currently doing a donation relay. These fan donation relays have once again confirmed the enormous influence of BTS and Jimin.

In addition to this good deed, the official account of the Korea Leukemia Children's Foundation has made headlines for its particular year-end project for "future hope" children, saying "those who love the Jimin gather to create a miracle for a warm spring day."

The project, which conveys the warmth of the end of the cold year, is organized by Jimin's Chinese fandom, Jimin Bar China, the first unofficial fan club to finalize the project after several discussions with the Korea Leukemia Children's Foundation. And they will be carried out to support the year-end fundraising.

Jimin Bar China explained the wisdom of the sponsorship, saying it would be an opportunity to increase the public's favor of the BTS Jimin, and also to learn about the current problems and to do their best to fight the disease with children.

Advertisements sponsored by the Korea Leukemia Children's Foundation will be sent through a total of 827 advertising devices on subway lines 1 through 4 in Seoul for a total of three weeks until January 1 next year, which will have a considerable advertising effect in Seoul and the metropolitan area.

The ad says, "I would like to present the warm hearts of our fans to children of childhood cancer." "Consider your warm interests and love so that children who are the hope of the future can grow up healthy and happy!" It contains messages such as "Jiminie, Let's make a miracle on a spring day" to promote the project.

In particular, Jimin's first self-written song called "Promise" released on December 31 last year was celebrated by setting a new record within 24 hours in the world's most extensive play on Soundcloud. In addition to the best record set by Jimin in 2019, the year-end sponsorship event of the Chinese fan club, which has supported every moment of Jimin for a whole year, is taking the lead in achieving a warm society with a positive influence on the general public.
