Passengers from flight NZ1942 depart Auckland Airport in buses for quarantine in Whangaparaoa.

Chinese New Year has been celebrated at the military camp where 157 evacuees from Wuhan are being kept in isolation following the coronavirus outbreak.

Less than two months after surfacing in late December in Wuhan, China, cases of the coronavirus have topped 37,000.

There have been no coronavirus cases in New Zealand to date, but two Kiwis tested positive for coronavirus while on the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan.

An Air New Zealand flight carrying 198 passengers from Wuhan touched down in Auckland on Wednesday.

On Monday, Ministry of Health director-general Ashley Bloomfield said Chinese New Year had been celebrated at the camp on Saturday night.

"Chinese New Year is an important cultural event and we organised this to honour that for both our guests with Chinese heritage and all others," Bloomfield said.

"Guests and staff organised the event together, showing the community spirit of those staying there.

"It was also one guest's birthday, so it's really nice that we were able to make it meaningful for them."

On Saturday, the ministry said it was grateful to members of the public who had donated items for the Wuhan returnees.

However, the ministry said there was no need for donated goods as it was supporting those based at the camp and provisioning supplies.

Family members and loved ones of the guests are still free to send items and the ministry would facilitate delivery.

At least 385 people have self isolated themselves in New Zealand after travelling through China following the outbreak.

Calls to a Ministry of Health-funded helpline have surged since the dedicated number launched last week.

National Telehealth Service chief executive Andrew Slater said: "In previous years at this time of year we would talk to around 900 people a day in Healthline – this year we are taking close to 1100 calls a day from people who have concerns about novel coronavirus or flu-like symptoms.

"That's a 22 per cent increase."

Slater said of the 1585 who have contacted the Healthline since January 30, none have met the clinical criteria to be tested for coronavirus.

The number, 0800 358 5453, is free and available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

People calling that line will be able to talk with a member of the National Telehealth Service and they will also have access to interpreters.
