News in brief:

Last call for Hiltonâ€™s 100% â€˜buy pointsâ€™ bonus â€¦ which I took up

There are a few hotel programme â€˜buy pointsâ€™ bonuses running at the moment.

The one finishing soon is Hilton Honors, which ends on Wednesday 19th.

You get a 100% bonus when you purchase 10,000+ points.

The Hilton â€˜buy pointsâ€™ page is here.

Regular readers of Head for Points will know that I value Hilton points at 0.33p each. You are paying 0.40p (0.5 cents) here so the maths in general doesnâ€™t work.

HOWEVER â€¦.. there ARE real bargains to be had at peak periods. I recently bought 140,000 points for my trip to the ITB travel show in Berlin in March. Hotel rates in Berlin go through the roof during ITB. I have always fancied giving the relatively new Waldorf Astoria Berlin a try â€“ picture below â€“ but â‚¬400 per night (Â£344, non-refundable) for my dates is a little steep. $350 (Â£271, refundable), which is what it costs to buy 70,000 points, is also not a bargain but brings the cost down to the level of a very average 5-star during ITB.

You can buy Hilton Honors points via this link. The offer ends on 19th February.

And with IHG Rewards Club â€¦..

IHG Rewards Club is currently offering a bonus of 75% when you buy 20,000+ points. The offer ends on 27th February. The page to buy points is here.

And Hyatt â€¦..

World of Hyatt is currently offering a 25% discount when you buy World of Hyatt points. The offer ends on 29th February. You can buy via this link.

Hyatt is about to reduce the points cost of some key European hotels such as Park Hyatt Mallorca, Grand Hyatt Athens and Park Hyatt Hamburg. I will cover this in more detail before the â€˜buy pointsâ€™ bonus ends.

British Airways slot sitting in action â€¦.

Heathrow Airport has a â€˜use it or lose itâ€™ system for take off and landing slots. This is, arguably, a sensible approach to take â€“ with such huge demand for Heathrow slots, it wouldnâ€™t be acceptable if airlines were allowed to sit on valuable slots without running flights.

In simple terms, an airline has to use a slot on 80% of dates during an airline â€˜seasonâ€™, which typically runs from March to October or October to March. Failure to do so means an automatic surrender of the slot to be reallocated to another airline.

This means that British Airways has a problem. As we covered last week, one of the two daily Hong Kong flights â€“ the one which lands at Heathrow at 4.45am in a hugely valuable â€˜curfew breakingâ€™ landing slot â€“ has been cancelled due to a collapse in demand.

Because the Government is still recommending travel to Hong Kong, unlike China, there are no extenuating circumstances. The flight was cancelled purely for commercial reasons. BA needs to land a flight at 4.45am on enough days to keep up the 80% average or the slot will be lost.

This is unfortunate news if you live in Athens. The first daily flight from Athens usually departs Greece at 8am:

In early March, it now departs at 2.40am to land exactly at 4.45am in the Hong Kong slot ðŸ™‚

The only upside here is that no person in their right mind will want to fly this, which may lead to some good deals. As Athens is a 160 tier point route in Club Europe, it may be possible to pop down to Athens after work and be back in the office, 160 tier points better off, by 7am the next day!

To be fair to BA, this is a better solution than flying a totally empty plane between, say, Gatwick and Heathrow at 4.30am just to fill the 4.45am landing slot.

Earn double Club Eurostar points to the Netherlands

The good news for anyone travelling between London and Amsterdam or Rotterdam is that DIRECT Eurostar return trains are about to start running.

Eurostar has been running from London TO Amsterdam and Rotterdam for a while now.

However, due to on-going work constructing immigration facilities, you could not travel TO London directly. Passengers from Amsterdam needed to get off the train in Brussels, clear passport control and get back onto a different train to complete their trip. Passengers from Rotterdam had to take a Thalys train to Brussels and change.

This nonsense is about to end!

From 30th April, trains will run directly from Amsterdam to St Pancras. From 18th May, you will also be able to travel directly from Rotterdam to St Pancras.

If you book a ticket THIS WEEK (the final date to book is 25th February) for travel to Amsterdam between 30th April and 30th June, or Rotterdam between 18th May and 30th June, you will receive double Club Eurostar points.

I value a Club Eurostar point at 10p-12.5p as this article explains. With this offer, you will be earning 2 points per Â£1 spent which means a rebate of 20p-25p per Â£1.

You can also transfer Eurostar points to the Accor Live Limitless hotel loyalty scheme at 1:3 (minimum transfer of 500 Eurostar points). As Accor points transfer 1:1 to Avios in Iberia Plus, you could earn 6 Avios per Â£1 spent on Eurostar via this offer. We explained how the Accor / Eurostar partnership works in this article.
