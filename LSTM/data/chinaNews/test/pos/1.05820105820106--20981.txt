Broad Electronics America is the marketing and sales arm of Changzhou Shincobroad, Ltd. The company has marketed under the Bolva brand in the U.S. and Canada since 2016 and manufactures private label brands for many retailers.

The company also offers a turn-key strategy to regional and mid-size retailers who want to market their own private label brand without many of the hassles of direct import.

Vice president and general manager Al Levene will be meeting with customers and prospects at the upcoming Las Vegas Market.

“We have done promotions with manufacturers such as Babcock and Furniture Fair in the past, and then about five years ago, we saw furniture companies get away from TV promotion,” Levene said.

Levene said the company’s North American team has 135 combined years in the business.

“We thought that now might be a good time get back into it so we want to go out and talk to manufacturers and retailers about what they do,” added Levene.
