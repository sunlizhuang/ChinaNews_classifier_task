I visited Tongji Hospital affiliated with Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, Hubei province on Feb 3 to see how medical workers were fighting against the epidemic.

When I arrived, 41-year-old Duan Jun -- a doctor from Beijing's China-Japan Friendship Hospital who was sent to support the hospital -- is getting prepared to enter the isolation ward with his peers.

It takes time -- about 10 minutes -- and is quite complicated to put on these protective gears including protective suits, surgical masks, goggles, and disposable gloves, and also shoes covers.

I saw them cheer each other on, saying "Wuhan, stay strong! China, stay strong!" They then helped each other write down names and working units to make themselves being identified during work.

I noticed that one of them even wore diaper in order to not ruin the protective suits.

I, putting on protective suits, followed them to the isolation ward. It's rather stuffy wearing the suits and I even felt anoxic under the masks, so I lowered my voice and slowed down making myself feel better.

Duan Jun, the doctor, who is also head of the 20-people supporting medical team from China-Japan Friendship Hospital, told me that he has stayed on his duty for couples of days.

"We've done rather good protective measures, so we don't worry about ourselves," he said. "But those who don't know much about the work may be afraid when seeing us."

Duan said that he was studying for the master's degree in Hunan province when SARS outbreak in 2003, and he reached some suspected cases at the time. He chose to work in the ICU because it allows him to fulfill a doctor's responsibility of saving the lives of patients.

He, now father of two, chose not to tell his family members where he is working in case they will worry about his health. He closed moments share at WeChat, lying that he is on duty at hospital in Beijing.

Duan, as the leader of the supporting medical team, also resumes responsibility of taking good care of the team members to better the efficiency of their work.

"Medical staff is rather important in fight against the virus so we can't fall ill," he said. "My leader told me that it's key to stay calm and avoid overstrain."

So far, the China-Japan Friendship Hospital sent about 155 medical workers to Wuhan, ranking first of the supporting medical teams across the nation.

Yang Meng, a health work among the first-batch supporting medical team to Wuhan, said that she has the confidence to beat against the novel coronavirus pneumonia as she once joined the battle against the SARS back in 2003.

Cui Wei, a nurse for anesthesiology who arrived in Wuhan on Feb 4, postponed her wedding that should be staged in March.

"National interests come ahead of others. It's the time that the nation needs us more," she said.
