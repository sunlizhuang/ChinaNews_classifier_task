Can you imagine what life would be like if every in-person interaction you had with someone received a rating?



China is experiencing this right now with the government’s social credit system. Each citizen receives a rank based on their observed behavior. Much like a financial credit score, you can do better or get worse based on the decisions you make.



The goal is to have one centralized system in place by the end of 2020. Its currently being run in a piecemeal fashion with city councils and private technology firms monitoring the information.



What is the overall goal of the social credit system in China? The government plans to offer rewards or consequences based on individual scores.

The Social Credit System Was First Announced in 2014

China isn’t jumping into the idea of a social credit system headfirst. This idea has been under development for over five years. The goal is to reinforce the idea that maintaining trust is a positive experience, while breaking it is a disgraceful way to live.



Millions of people are already participating in this system’s beta program. The scheme is mandatory when it goes live for the entire population.



The exact methodology of how someone raises or lowers their personal scores is kept secret by the Chinese government, but some choices have resulted in noticeable changes. If you get caught with a driving violation, smoke in places without permission, or buy more video games “than necessary,” your scores can go down.



If they go down too far, then that person will experience government-based restrictions.

What Happens with a Poor Social Credit Score?

China is already punishing people who have a social credit score that they deem to be too low. Over 9 million people are now blocked from purchasing tickets for domestic flights in the country, while another 3 million individuals cannot buy business-class train tickets.



Just the act of trying to purchase something when restricted can lower your score even more.



China is also throttling the Internet speeds of those with low social credit scores. The system will monitor who pays their bills on time, who plays video games for a long time each day, and even individual purchases.



When 17 people refused to carry out military duties in China, they could not enroll in higher education programs. These individuals were barred from high school or continuing their college-level studies. One student was denied an incoming spot because his father had a bad score in this system.



The social credit system will eventually give the best jobs to the people with the highest scores. It will stop people with bad scores from booking premium hotel rooms, participating in holiday activities, or even taking a vacation.



If you have a good score, then the Chinese government can speed up your travel applications to various locations around the world, including Europe. One woman even said she could book rooms without paying a cash deposit because of your decisions.



China wants to warn people about who its “bad” citizens are. Will it change individual behavior in positive ways, or is it just another scheme to manipulate choices based on government preferences?
