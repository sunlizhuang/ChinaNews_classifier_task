LONDON, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese down jacket fashion brand BOSIDENG made its debut at London Fashion Week here on Sunday.

A spokesman of the company said it is not easy for the Chinese fashion brand to enter the official schedule of London Fashion Week, especially when China is engaged in a vigorous effort to combat the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.

"The brand BOSIDENG represents China at this international fashion show. Now it is a hard time for China, but Chinese people are really strong. I am proud to work with Chinese people. I am learning a lot from them," BOSIDENG designer Pietro Ferragina, who has been working in China for 10 years, told Xinhua at the backstage.

At the end of the show, the designer and models walked down the stage, wearing classic Chinese red down jackets and holding the national flag of China to show their support for the country.

The brand's spokesman said that BOSIDENG has aided the fight against the epidemic by donating 150,000 high-quality down jackets worth 300 million yuan (about 43 million U.S. dollars) to provide warmth and protection for frontline public health workers.

Founded in 1976, BOSIDENG has been improving the design and manufacturing of its products, gaining reputation in China and beyond.
