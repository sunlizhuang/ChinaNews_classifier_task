Feverish with impatience, (some) folk in the London restaurant world are waiting for the long-delayed opening of Davies and Brook, which is replacing Fera at Claridge’s. I explain to my companion the high excitement instilled by the involvement of chef Daniel Humm from Eleven Madison Park in New York as we arrange to meet there at 8pm in its first week of public trading. Amy goes to The Savoy.

Happily, female staff dressed in what I read we must now call soirée suits (trouser suits are so last decade) take her late arrival in their stride — movement that never lets up. Balletic luxe stormtroopers are how she describes them. I am content checking out the room, which, if it is the case that no expense has been spared, is worth it. In the evening, pearly grey velvet banquettes shimmer in chivalrous lighting that obliges food and customer alike. A 40-part installation of Roni Horn photos showing mammary mounds of earth points to a guiding spirit with more than a passing interest in art.

Fine dining is an art too, one that these days perhaps has to struggle harder to defend that position. Against the accusation of inevitable high cost, I’d point you to the separate bar area with snacks like CFC (Claridge’s Fried Chicken), and also the two-course lunch for £38. We go with four courses — cold, warm, main, dessert — at £98 per person.

Of course there are little extras, sometimes erroneously considered freebies. At dinner and lunch they are outstanding. I relish equally iced scallop and apple served with hot scallop broth alongside, and the small bowl of soupy rice strafed with ginger and topped with chewy mushrooms (shitake?). “Ah, congee,” I say to the maître d’ Billy Peelle, who has apparently come from Eleven Madison Park to stay, as has head chef Dmitri Magi. He looks a bit ruffled and hurries away. With these “amuses” arrive irresistible bread rolls with the texture of croissant plus a disc of butter topped with a gel made from the reduced stocks. When my pal asks for more bread, it arrives with Vacherin jelly crowning the accompanying butter. This is a kitchen with no shortage of chefs.

With respect to his cold starter of bass ceviche — “not muted despite being very controlled in its avocado body armour” — and main course of honey and lavender glazed dry-aged duck (a signature dish), Max observes that his meal is like an intellectual exercise in restraint of which Coco Chanel would approve. She advised putting together an outfit, studying the effect, then removing one item. Storing an unwrapped duck in the fridge for a fortnight is a food fashion tip I might well adopt; the meat was perfect. Blood used as a binder in its aptly named Sauce Civet is another lesson, this one in histories ancient and modern.

Flying in from the US and offering black cod shows insouciance. That sweet/savoury/silky hit Nobu Matsuhisa popularised is here but Napa cabbage rendered crisp as nori, and soft, shredded kohlrabi as garnish, distinguishes it and maybe even gives it a Swiss accent (Humm is originally from Zurich).

Staff convey the choice of desserts. A velvety chocolate bar with a scoop of coconut ice cream justifies every Bounty recently avoided in the Celebrations tin and unadorned segments of clementine in the circus of citrus were just rather touching. We drank wine by carafe, particularly liking the Terras Gauda O Rosal 2018, a tendency clocked by the beautiful French sommelier who topped up our glasses after the carafe ran out.

Welcome to London, Daniel Humm, with your snappy Cummings-like company slogan Make It Nice. Someone has to.
