By BBN Staff: China is recognized for its rich history and culture and today, Chinese around the world are celebrating the Lunar New Year tradition.

The New Year festival is a 15-day celebration to honor the commencement of the lunar calendar across Asia.

The celebration includes a chance to share a meal and carry bags of gifts to families back home in China.

Chinese authorities have canceled all large scale Chinese New Year celebrations in an effort to contain the growing spread of the Wuhan coronavirus in China.

Despite this, many Chinese around the world as in Belize will host their parades celebrating Chinese culture.

This year also means that they are entering the year of the rat.

The year of the metal rat symbolizes the first animal of the 12 zodiac signs that rotate in a 12 year cycle.

Chinese media report that people born in the year of the rat are optimistic, energetic and likable by all.

In Chinese culture, rats are seen as a sign of wealth and surplus.

So, if you are lucky enough to see the traditional lion dance today, be sure to enjoy and send us some nice pictures.
