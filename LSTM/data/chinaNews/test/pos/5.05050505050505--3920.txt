Appointment

9 January 2020

The Westin Resort Nusa Dua, has appointed Chef Davide Allievi to its culinary team. He has arrived on Nusa Dua Bali direct from a period as Chef de Cuisine for the Michelin Plate winning Limoni Italian Restaurant at The Ritz Carlton Guangzhou, China.

As a young and contemporary Italian Chef, Davide Allievi is expected to bring passion, energy and innovation to his new role at the resort. He comes with an impressive background and valuable Michelin Star kitchen experience. Born and raised in Italy, Chef Davide has a Culinary Arts Diploma from the Instituto Paritario Professionale "Michele Pinto". Upon completing his studies, he embarked on a culinary career and fine-tuned his skills with a succession of jobs in Italy and London.

Once armed with a wealth of expertise as a Sous Chef, he relocated to Beijing, China in 2016 where he took charge of the daily operations of a gourmet restaurant and bakery. Chef Davide remained in the Chinese capital for another year before accepting a position as Chef de Cuisine at Il Forno Italian Restaurant in Grand Hyatt Chenyang.

Now Chef Davide finds himself on the island of Bali where he is responsible for Prego, a Westin concept restaurant that puts the fun back into Italian dining. This family-friendly venue satisfies appetites with its generous portions of classic pasta dishes, regional specialties and pizzas that represent real value for money.

Once he is familiar with the availability of local ingredients, Chef Davide is looking forward to revitalizing the menu at Prego and putting his own signature on each dish. He will also take the restaurant's Brunch Infinito to the next level with lots of delicious dishes and live cooking options.
