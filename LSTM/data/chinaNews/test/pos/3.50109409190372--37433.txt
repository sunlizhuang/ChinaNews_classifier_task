The Hall of Fame Central Labor Council, AFL-CIO, has a new president. Joe Sterling, an international representative with the Steelworkers, replaces Dan Sciury who died in December. Sciury led the council for 35 years.

CANTON After more than 35 years, there is a new president leading the Hall of Fame Central Labor Council, AFL-CIO.

Joe Sterling, an international staff representative with the United Steelworkers, was elected by acclamation when the local met on Jan. 16.

Sterling fills the post vacated after the Dec. 13 death of Dan Sciury, who had led the council since 1984. Sciury, 81, died following a short illness.

A member of Steelworkers Local 3610, which represents employees at United Foundries in Canton, Sterling has been a Steelworkers international representative for two years. He served as the Hall of Fame council's secretary-treasurer since February 2018. Before that he worked four years as a trustee.

Sterling said he met Sciury in the late 1980s when he attended a union counselor program the labor council president led. "You could sense the dedication he had for all workers and the community," Sterling said of Sciury.

Sterling pledged to carry on the tradition of Sciury's leadership as labor council president. "I will be following his lead and guidance," he said.

Sciury was involved with the community for a number of years, reaching out to organizations, making connections and building a network, Sterling said.

"Iâ€™ll never know all of the folks that Dan did," he said.

Through the years Sciury guided the local AFL-CIO group through changes that reflected the national labor movement. The Canton Labor Council evolved into the Greater Stark County Labor Council. It became the Hall of Fame Labor Council in 2008 and is composed of delegates from union locals in Stark, Tuscarawas and Columbiana counties.

The labor council's leadership consists of good, hard-working people, Sterling said. "I have a lot of help around me."

In addition to electing Sterling as president, the council also elected members to serve four-year terms on its executive board. Peggy Griffith moves from first vice president to secretary-treasurer, while Rollie Dreussi continues as recording secretary. Joe Liolios is first vice president; Rick Waikem, second vice president; Stevan Pickard, third vice president; Bob Mueller, fourth vice president representing Tuscarawas County; and John Dyce, fifth vice president representing Columbiana County.

Jim Williams serves as sergeant-at-arms, while trustees are Nanette Folsom, Brian Garber, Mark Fete, Curt Mayle and Apryl Marteney; with members-at-large Jim Ergon, Todd Beegle, Bob Harper, Dan Fonte (representing the Alliance for Retired Americans) and Vance VanVoorhis.

The Hall of Fame council meets the third Thursday of each month at the Golden Hall Lodge for Steelworkers Local 1123.
