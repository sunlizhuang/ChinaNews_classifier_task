The deal saw a boost in the market and opening up of prospects of trade but also saw the end of escalation in the dispute between the two countries.

Despite the trade deal having a long way to go, Trump stated that China has committed to $200 billion in purchases of American goods and services while Vice President Mike Pence stated that their agricultural purchases would be from $40 billion to $50 billion.

The trade deal between the two superpowers saw many investors celebrating, however that celebration was short-lived when analysts pointed out that previous rounds of tariffs were still in place and that Huawei was still blacklisted.
