New Zealand authorities delayed the departure of a plane from the Chinese city of Wuhan to allow a four-year-old British child to escape.

Diplomat Danae Dholakia said the child was among Britsh families who were given clearance to leave the country following the coronavirus outbreak.

The official tweeted: "So grateful to £NZ colleagues for getting 14 Brits/family members onto NZ flight from Wuhan last night, incl. holding up departure so @ukinchina could get clearances for the last passenger, a British 4 yr old child, to board.

"New Zealand: you're wonderful!"

A commission spokesman said: "We are grateful to the NZ Government for their assistance in helping 8 British nationals & their dependents fly to Auckland from Wuhan.

"Their chartered Air NZ flight arrived safely today, with a number of NZers & other nationalities. Our teams are providing consular support."

The flight left China shortly after UK officials urged any remaining Brits to leave the country immediately.

It comes as the death toll nears 500 and thousands more remain struck down by the disease.

UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement: “The safety and security of British people will always be our top priority.

"As such, we now advise British Nationals in China to leave the country if they can, to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus.

"Where there are still British Nationals in Hubei Province who wish to be evacuated, we will continue to work around the clock to facilitate this."
