CANTON, Mo. — A Culver-Stockton College criminal justice professor's idea has grown into a special class at the college culminating in an opportunity for select students to honor men and women who lost their lives in the line of duty.

Hannibal native and sheriff's deputy Seth McBride served with the Hannibal Police Department from 2003 to 2012, and he wanted to honor officers who gave the ultimate sacrifice through the volunteer-driven Fallen Officer Project he created in 2018.

The project quickly gained administrative approval, and today McBride carefully selects a group of nine or 10 students to enroll in his In the Line of Duty class and participate in the Fallen Officer Project each spring.

"I wanted something to show respect for the officers who lost their lives in the line of duty, and at the same time, teach something to our next generation — especially in the field — coming in at the college level," McBride said.

The Fallen Officer Project begins with students selecting an officer who died in the line of duty — they could be from Missouri or other communities from across the world. McBride said many CS-C students select an officer from their hometown as they begin the project.

Before the students can research an officer's life and service, they get approval from family members and from the department. Each student writes a paper.

In March, students make a presentation of the officers through Facebook Live, sharing the background of the officer's life with pictures and a synopsis.

The live broadcast has reached more than 200,000 people.

After the presentation, McBride takes the students to the Badge of Honor 5K Run in Poplar Bluff. The run supports multiple charities dedicated to first responders, and each student runs with a Fallen Officer Project T-shirt with a picture of the officer they represent on the back.

"They run for that officer, and then when they complete the run, they send off the finishing medal as well as a formal letter thanking the department and/or the family for letting them represent them," McBride said.

McBride said students interact with department officers and family members of the fallen officer through the "life-changing" experience.

During the first year, Alyce Bava came to the Badge of Honor run, and student Nick Bringer presented the medal to her in honor of her late son James Bava.

McBride said there are many strong connections made, and the students are dedicated to the cause through every stage. Fellow student Eric Pingolt presented the medal and letter to the widow and son of officer Blake C. Snyder at a park dedicated in his memory.

"Every student has put their heart and soul into it, and they really understand more and more once they start getting engaged with the officer and what they did for the community, and the family members who are willing to open up to my students and share memories and things," McBride said. "It's been great."

Dalton Huffman of Hannibal, a junior, said he is about halfway through the steps to complete the Fallen Officer Project with fellow students.

He said everyone involved shares a serious dedication to the cause — he remembered submitting his application and how he and his colleagues were "hand-picked" for the endeavor.

"I'm very excited about it. It's an honor to be in this class, because I look at it like an opportunity to represent somebody who died in the line of duty, somebody who is brave and somebody who should be remembered as so," Huffman said. "I can't even put into words how excited I am to do this."
