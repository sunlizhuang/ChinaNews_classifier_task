In 2020, luxury real estate investors should keep an eye on three key cities: Paris, Singapore and Vancouver. Each of these is expected to heat up, boosted by sweeping transit upgrades, increasingly robust tech sectors, and changing political conditions in their regions.



In Paris, for instance, a multibillion-euro Grand Paris project is planned to improve transit and revamp metro stations, and anticipation of the 2024 Summer Olympic games is further helping to invite investment and development.



“We’re catching up,” said Hugues de la Morandière of Agence Varenne, a Savills partner in Paris. “Paris had a slow period, but [President Emannuel] Macron has brought more activity to France, and Paris is a very good place for investors today.”

In Singapore, mainland Chinese buyers are turning toward the Southeast Asian capital as a safer place for investment than Hong Kong, with Indonesians and Malaysians also showing interest.



“Investors consider Singapore real estate as a safe asset for wealth preservation and capital appreciation,” said Han Huan Mei, director of research of List Sotheby's International Realty, Singapore. “Besides those top three nationalities, we see increasing new affluent buyers from developing countries, such as Cambodia, investing in Singapore.”



And Vancouver is showing signs of recovery after a slowdown in the luxury sector, the result of a building boom and a high tax on foreign buyers. Real estate analysts say the state of luxury real estate in the Canadian city won’t experience a radical change this year, but it still offers opportunities for discounts on high-end properties.

Paris



Real estate analysts predict an especially busy 2020 for Paris. One major factor is the €26 billion (US$28.7 billion) Grand Paris project, a plan to transform Paris into a “world city,” a key element of which is the Grand Paris Express transit scheme. This expansion of the city’s metro system will include four new lines and an extension of two existing ones, and the new stations are anticipated to present many development opportunities. The French capital will also play host to the 2024 Olympic games, further spurring development and investment.



“Prime Paris is having a strong run at the moment,” said Paul Tostevin, director of world research with Savills in London. “Looking back, prime prices grew by 6.4% in 2019, according to our world index.”



This year, Savills predicts slightly slower, but still robust increases in its global prime residential report for 2020, with a forecast of 4% to 5.9% price growth in Paris.

Furthermore, Paris was ranked No. 1 for its real estate prospects in 2020 by PricewaterhouseCoopers in its Emerging Trends in Real Estate report for Europe, with one fund manager interviewed calling the city “an economic powerhouse.”

The Macron administration also instituted changes to the tax on capital income, boosting the disposable income of top-earning households in France and encouraging luxury real estate investment.



At the high end, home prices are expected to continue to increase this year, in part because of limited inventory and land. In Central Paris in particular, the opportunities for new development are quite limited due to scarcity of land for new developments.



“We do expect continued growth, based on the fact that the market for prime and ultra prime is very narrow,” Mr. de la Morandière said. “Paris is a fully built city, and within the ring road, it’s a fairly small market. When you focus on the first eight arondissements, it’s the size of a provincial town.”



But with the plan for new train stations linking outer suburbs to the city, analysts expect new prime developments to spring up and attract wealthy buyers.

The bulk of demand for prime real estate in Paris comes from domestic buyers, though more investors from the U.S., the Middle East, and elsewhere in Europe are entering the market.



“International buyers look for turnkey properties, and Paris has been a little later on the curve with that,” Mr. Tostevin said. “But lately, we’ve seen developers go in and purchase buildings and redevelop them to high specifications, putting in the amenities you’d find in other top-tier world cities and bringing it up to global standards.”



Brexit is another factor driving both French-born and international buyers to Paris.



“A lot of French people who work in finance and live in London will want to come back, because of professional, educational, or cultural reasons, and due to concerns it will not be as easy to go back and forth between France and the U.K.,” Mr. de la Morandière said. “Brexit definitely brings more money into the market. Some banks, like JP Morgan, are moving people to Paris, which will strengthen the financial district.”

These factors together mean that Paris will continue to be a smart investment for 2020, though price growth may slow a bit, Mr. de la Morandière said, because “the catch-up effect is pretty much over.”



Still, limited space and inventory means competition for prime properties will remain strong.



“By global standards, Paris is still pretty punchy compared to other forecasts we’re looking at for 2020,” Mr. Tostevin said.



Singapore



Singapore was ranked the top market for real estate investment in PricewaterhouseCoopers’s Emerging Trends in Real Estate report for the Asia-Pacific region in 2020. In recent years, Singapore’s prime markets suffered from an oversupply of high-end properties that slowed the pace of the luxury sector.



In 2019, however, the office sector is booming, with large corporations enticed to open branches in Singapore due to favorable perceptions of its safety, and vacancies are at an all-time low, according to the PwC report.

“Singapore is valued for its political stability, strong financial sector, open economy and stable currency. Moreover, the Singapore government’s proactive and progressive stance in handling the global economic crisis and harnessing technology to stay ahead as a global city bodes well for multinational corporations to set up their regional and international headquarters here,” Ms. Mei said. “In recent years, several ultra-high-net-worth families from Asia, as well as some from Europe and America, set up family offices in Singapore, as they are keen to use Singapore as a gateway for their investments into Asia.”



This trend should continue in 2020, with Knight Frank predicting in its Prime Global Forecast for 2020 that Singapore will experience real estate price growth at around 3%.



In recent years, mainland Chinese buyers have been the main drivers of demand for luxury residential real estate, motivated in part by political unrest rendering Hong Kong a less attractive destination for investment. In January, inquiries from Chinese buyers were up by 15% in January.



“In the past two years, around 30% of the luxury homes sold were bought by mainland Chinese,” Ms. Mei said. “Having said that, we expect Singapore’s strategic position as an Asian gateway and our strong fundamentals to continue to attract the affluent in an increasingly uncertain global market.”

Singapore’s 20% tax on residential property purchases by foreigners may deter some investors, though it isn’t stopping ultra-high-net-worth buyers from purchasing the city’s “super penthouses.” Last year, for instance, the founder of British electronics company Dyson bought a $54.17 million three-story unit in Singapore’s Wallich Residence.



One potential snag for Singapore, however, is the currently unfolding coronavirus crisis, which has resulted in travel restrictions placed on mainland Chinese, Ms. Mei said. Currently, Singapore has a travel ban on visitors from mainland China, and may extend the ban to those from Hong Kong.



Vancouver



Recent years have been challenging for prime real estate in Vancouver. The city’s formerly blazinghot markets, where the price of single-family homes jumped from C$400,000 to C$1.75 million in just 15 years cooled significantly in the wake of a foreign buyers tax imposed in 2016. Many buyers began turning toward other Canadian cities, like Montreal, for investment.



The British Columbia city won’t see a dramatic bounce back in 2020, analysts say, but there are signs of improvement. The number of home sales rose in 2019, though prices remained below the region’s 10-year average.

Foreign buyers, especially those from Asia, have retreated, leaving Vancouver with an excess of high-end homes.



“Chinese demand was a huge driver of the luxury market, but it has pulled back significantly,” said Steve Saretsky, a Vancouver realtor who blogs about the city’s real estate. “Developers built a lot of new luxury single-family homes, and we were left with an oversupply. I think it’s going to be a better year for the luxury market, but there’s still a lot of supply to work through.”



It will take time for the city to absorb all that inventory, he added, given that now most buyers in Vancouver are locals seeking more affordable properties.



But for wealthy investors, there is ample opportunity to buy luxury housing at a discount.

“If you have C$2 million to C$3 million kicking around, you have the pick of the litter,” Mr. Saretsky said. “You could wait it out for a good deal, because there are definitely sellers out there who need and want to sell.”



There is also new interest in Vancouver real estate coming from the tech sector. After the Amazon HQ2 deal fell apart in New York City, the tech giant announced it would expand and bring new jobs to its Vancouver offices. Other companies, like Shopify, are planning Vancouver debuts as well.



“Tech is booming in Vancouver, bringing in a lot of wealth and entrepreneurs,” said Mike Rampf of Engel & Völkers Vancouver. “We’re seeing more activity now than in the previous two years, with more buyers coming out to look at our properties, and more accepted offers in higher price brackets.”

And though the number of foreign buyers has diminished, Mr. Rampf said that there are a number of Canadian passport holders from Hong Kong showing interest in the city, as they seek a more stable region in which to invest.

The safe, pleasant lifestyle Vancouver offers should continue to be a significant draw for buyers looking for a city in which to put down roots.



“Between the level of educational opportunities and the talent coming here, there are so many positive attributes to this city,” Mr. Rampf said. “There are going to be families moving here on a very regular basis. I see an optimistic future and the luxury market will stay strong.”
