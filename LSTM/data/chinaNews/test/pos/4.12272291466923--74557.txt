WAKi International Group starting from Malaysia, is pursuing its development opportunities along the “Belt and Road Initiative” countries in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in South East Asian countries to cooperate with the local diverse environment. At the time of exploring business opportunities for innovation opportunities, we adhere the tolerant attitude of “respecting differences and integrating with each other", thus successfully survive through many difficulties and storms. For example during the Asian financial turmoil in 1998, there was serious unrest in Indonesia, many foreign companies fled and evacuated; fortunately Chairman Teo Choo Guan always maintained the attitude of integration and tolerance, he was protected and sheltered by local employees during turmoil, hence he could take measures without fear and hesitation, and that strategy made him survive after the crisis, and managed to turn the crisis into opportunity and allow the company to develop faster and more macroscopically.

For WAKi International Chairman Mr. Teo Choo Guan to be invited to the Great Hall of the People to participate the Economic Summit, it has to do with more than 20 years of his experience. He is adopting a "sacrifice-conquer" communication method which make use of the crisis into a turning point for more opportunities, break through the status quo and change the future. This so-called "sacrifice-conquer" requires our own paying efforts as to touching ourselves and others. Consequently, we would “sacrifice together, experience it together, create the value together and enjoy the future together” and this is also the value for WAKi International Group to get rid of the traditional business model successfully, and now in the era of rapid high-tech, we could continue to maintain stable development. Besides that, Chairman Teo has won numerous awards in the past few years, including 2019 June 30 becoming the first Malaysian to win the World Peace Award in Sweden.
