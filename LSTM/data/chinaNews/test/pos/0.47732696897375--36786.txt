We quiz some long-term Beijingers on how they intend to spend this year's Chinese New Year and hopefully uncover some horror stories along the way. 过年 How, y'all?

As Jing-A Brewing's executive chef, Simone Thompson, who is originally from Australia's Gold Coast, sure knows her way around a kitchen. So when it comes to tips about handling the excess consumption of food and libations, and how to enjoy the CNY break to the fullest, we could think of no-one better to ask...

What does your average CNY entail? Where are you headed this year?

The main focus is to take a break. Last year, I headed to Cambodia to escape China and quickly realized that, during CNY, there is no real escape from China. I'm going to New Zealand this year, and I expect the same result, but with more wine.

Have you ever experienced a 'nightmare' CNY?

Yes. Every plane journey back to Beijing.

What’s your zodiac? Do you think you’re typical of that zodiac sign? Why or why not?

I'm a rabbit. Having just looked this up I found 'Modest,' 'Friendly,' and 'Sober' as key traits. I feel like I am two out of three of those.

Which dishes or drinks do you particularly look forward to enjoying every year?

I know I should say food… but it’s wine. It’s always wine.

Do you have any tips for avoiding the classic CNY excesses of eating and drinking?

I don’t understand the question.

Got any tips on how to deflect those awkward family questions?

Stay in the kitchen.

Is there anybody deserving of a fat hongbao from you this year?

My wonderful Head chefs at Jing-A – shout out to Tony and Jim (and the rest of the staff).

If there’s one thing you could change about CNY, what would it be?

Despite how ignorant this sounds, I wish there was a bigger gap between Christmas and CNY. That way my friends that live abroad wouldn’t be so weirded out by the indulgent holidays taken at the end of January.

What do you predict the Year of the Rat holds for you?

Probably more of the same. Enjoying the suspiciously convenient life of Beijing, working hard on opening more locations with Jing-A and having delightful dinner parties at my crib.
