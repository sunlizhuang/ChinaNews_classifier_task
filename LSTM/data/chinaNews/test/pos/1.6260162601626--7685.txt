Chinatown, that stretch of road along Spring Mountain from the Strip to Rainbow Boulevard, bustles with construction activity, ready to reveal new restaurants and bars to Las Vegas.

Shanghai Plaza, the 57,566-square-foot retail hub at the corner of Spring Mountain and Arville Road, promises a growing roster of confirmed tenants. Tai 2 Chinese Sauerkraut Fish, hit-California brand SomiSomi with Korean-inspired soft serve in taiyaki cones, and Korean dessert cafe Sul & Beans were recently announced.

Three dining options head to the Lotus apartment complex on Spring Mountain Road at 3463 Procyon St., including California taqueria The Taco Stand with its roster of Tijuana–style street food, and Food & Fare.

The new 33,000-square-foot Golden Spring Plaza at the corner of Spring Mountain and Duneville Street plans to bring Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar and its Louisiana-style Cajun seafood, Japan’s T-Swirl Crepe with 100 percent gluten-free rice flour batter, and Shigotonin, a teppanyaki from the operator of the former Tempura Express in Honolulu, as well as China-born Feng Cha, Imperial Seafood Buffet, and Saigon Baguette.

In the meantime, a new kaiseki restaurant arrives in Chinatown soon — Kaiseki Sanga from the Mon Restaurant Group — and Taiwan’s Tiger Sugar with its Instagram-worthy brown sugar boba is on the way.
