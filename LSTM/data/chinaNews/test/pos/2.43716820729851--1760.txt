International TV-manufacturing giants, including three from China, flexed their muscle at CES 2020 as bigger TV sets, higher contrast and more innovative technologies become the "new normal" for the industry.

With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, TVs are no longer just viewing devices but have increasingly become the central hub for consumers to control smart appliances at home.

Chinese electronics giant TCL on Monday introduced its new Vidrian Mini-LED technology, which would help create sharper contrast and brilliant luminance for LCD LED-TV picture performance. The technology will help improve the performance of TCL's 8K LCD panels.

Hisense, a Chinese multinational major appliance and electronics manufacturer, unveiled a wide array of television sets.

On Sunday, Shenzhen-based TV maker Skyworth announced its ambitions to enter the American television market by hosting its first-ever global product launch event in the US on the sidelines of CES.

According to the Consumer Technology Association, TVs are continuing their reign as the flagship technology in many US homes. Overall, TV manufacturers will ship 40.8 million units in 2020, driving $23.4 billion in revenue.

Leo Tang, chief brand officer of Skyworth, headquartered in Guangdong province, told China Daily that the company sees the US as a highly competitive market with major prospects, especially for high-end products.

Skyworth unveiled two new products — the W81 and W81 pro — wallpaper-thin OLED TVs, as well as the Q91, its first 8K TV available to consumers in the US. Its products will be supported by its Swaiot™ technology, which essentially allows users to link the TV and other smart appliances.

Tang said the company decided to reveal its first 8K (8,000-pixel resolution) product now because it believes 8K content and the industry chain have matured. The TVs will be available to American consumers starting in June, followed by sales in Europe and Southeast Asia.

Hisense's new L5 4K laser TV set features an ultra short throw projector.

"The L5 brings a big-screen cinematic experience home at an incredible price of $5,999," said David Gold, vice-president of consumer electronics at Hisense Americas.

The newest addition to Hisense's Android TV lineup, the H9G quantum series, features quantum dot for "true to life color", Gold said. The product will come with the addition of Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos image and sound technologies, as well as a built-in Google Assistant.

"Here in the US, sales for Hisense TVs increased more than 50 percent," said Lan Lin, executive vice-president of Hisense Group and chairman of Hisense International.

TCL, whose sales volume in North America has increased 31.7 percent year-on-year, also unveiled an array of QLED television sets for its premier X series and Cityline series.

The X915 model is the latest TCL QLED television featuring 8K quantum dot display technology. It also supports Dolby Vision HDR imaging technology.

"We are proud to announce that TCL has joined with the 8K Association to develop a new 8K association-certified program. TCL plans to launch TVs this year that will exceed the high standards established as part of the 8K Association Certified program," said Aaron Dew, director of product development at TCL North America.

In North America, TCL is partnering with Roku to launch the first 8K TCL Roku TV later this year, he added.

South Korean electronics super house LG showed off its rollable 65-inch OLED TV at its news conference Monday. LG also offered a 48-inch OLED TV as an option for the first time. Company officials touted how ThinQ, LG's own AI platform, simplifies people's lives by doing tasks such as picking up the best laundry cycles.

Leaders at Japan's Panasonic briefly spoke about an all-new flagship OLED TV for 2020.

South Korea's Samsung unveiled the company's Micro LED TV, called The Wall.
