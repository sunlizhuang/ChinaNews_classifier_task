SISB (Pracha Uthit) underscored its dedication and focus to Chinese language, culture and arts by hosting a showcase of traditional intangible Chinese arts, in collaboration with Thailand Maritime Silk Road Confucius Institute headed by Somdet Phra Maharatchamongkhonlamuni, President of the Council, and supported by Confucius Institute Headquarters in the Kingdom of Thailand.

The event, which was attended by more than 1,000 students, teachers and parents, provided various hands-on workshops where students could try their hand at traditional Chinese arts, such as clay moulding, wood carving, tie dyeing, and traditional Chinese printing methods.

Mr Kelvin Koh, Chief Executive Officer of SISB Public Company Limited, said: “We are delighted to be working with the Confucius Institute Headquarters in the Kingdom of Thailand and the Thailand Maritime Silk Road Confucius Institute on various initiatives for the development of Chinese teaching and Chinese culture. Chinese has always been a key component of SISB’s unique curriculum and it has become our strength as well.”

Besides the showcase of traditional Chinese arts, SISB Pracha Uthit was officially licensed as an examination centre for Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi (HSK) and Youth Chinese Test (YCT), international standardised exams that test and rate Chinese language proficiency for non-native Chinese speakers.

“Since our cooperation with SISB began in 2019, we have achieved record-high results in the history of Thailand Maritime Silk Road Confucius Institute, in terms of the number of test participants and test results,” said Ms Wang Shangxue, Chinese Dean of Thailand Maritime Silk Road Confucius Institute.

Since 2019, a total of 403 SISB students have sat the HSK and YCT tests, and these two benchmarks of Chinese language proficiency have provided our students with many opportunities for their future development.
