But with the tourism industry losing an estimated $1 billion a month from the Chinese tourist ban, there are growing calls for it to be lifted sooner rather than later as some businesses struggle to stay afloat.

China is Australia's number one tourism market, delivering 1.4 million visitors a year and contributing about $12 billion annually to the economy.

Mr Westaway said the tourism industry understood the government was dealing with a public health issue first and foremost, but the economic damage from the coronavirus – which has also hit the education industry hard – was becoming very serious.

He said Australia needed to get back on the front foot because countries around the world would be working hard to woo back Chinese tourists – including China, which would want to boost its own domestic tourism industry.

"The tourism industry is front and centre of this and we are copping the brunt," he said.

"Let's not kid ourselves, this is going to be a long haul. It will take time for the capacity to come back."

Federal Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham admitted the coronavirus had delivered a "very significant blow" for the tourism sector, coming on top of the summer of bushfires.

But he said the travel ban was also ensuring Australia was a safe destination for when it was eventually lifted.

"Australia has very well-established measures and safeguards to deal with the threat of viruses in terms of keeping firstly Australians safe and preventing the spread of such diseases in Australia," he said.

"These have in the past minimised the impact of other viruses on our tourism industry by giving people the confidence in the safety of visiting Australia."

Calls for 'rebuilding fund'

Senator Birmingham would not comment on whether the $76 million given to Tourism Australia – which has been used to get locals to holiday in Australia as well as spruik the regions to international visitors – would be expanded.

"We will work closely with our tourism industry partners to assess the impacts of this and how we may be recalibrate the promotion of Australia to minimise the impact of these actions on our tourism businesses," he said.

Many tourism operators are dealing with the double blow of bushfires and coronavirus, which has hit at the worst possible time around the bumper Chinese New Years period.

Southern Ocean Lodge owner James Baillie said his family was committed to rebuilding the popular Kangaroo Island tourism destination after it was destroyed by fire last month.

But he said the government may need to step in, not just by promoting destinations but by potentially providing a rebuilding fund.

Southern Ocean Lodge on Kangaroo Island was gutted by fires, but half of the island was not affected.

"We are passionate and driven to return Southern Ocean Lodge as an Australian tourism icon as quickly as possible," he said.

"The elephant in the room, not just for us, is insurance – what it will cost and whether we will be able to get full coverage. Government may need to step up, possibly in the form of a catastrophic insurance fund or other mechanism to facilitate reinvestment."
