President Donald Trump gave his State of the Union address Tuesday night. Here’s how some local and state lawmakers reacted:

U.S. SEN. ROB PORTMAN, R-Ohio

“Tonight President Trump outlined his plans to continue to grow our economy and strengthen our national security, building on three years of progress in improving the quality of life for the American people. As the president said tonight, over the last few years – through tax reform and regulatory relief, along with new trade agreements with our three biggest trading partners Canada, Mexico and China – we’ve given the American economy a real shot in the arm. We have more work to do, and I was pleased to hear the president talk about the need for more skills training and career and technical education. We have a great opportunity to pass the bipartisan JOBS Act this year, which would jumpstart skills training that is needed so badly. I was also pleased to hear the president talk about the need to rebuild our crumbling roads and bridges through a new infrastructure bill.

“President Trump talked a lot about how well the economy is doing. But I don’t measure the economy by the stock market. I measure it by people’s paychecks, the cost of healthcare, housing and education. And the reality is that for far too many people in this country, hard work isn’t paying off like it should. President Trump doesn’t understand that, and he’s used the White House to enrich people like himself.

“I thought this was one of the President’s best speeches to date. Its optimism is exactly what we need with so many shadows hanging over our heads. The bottom line is that Americans’ lives are measurably improved. Thanks to efforts from congressional Republicans in the previous Congress and the President, new trade deals, tax cuts, and regulatory reform have reinvigorated our economy.- Rep. Davidson represents Miami, Clark, Butler, part of Darke and Preble counties in Congress.

“Nancy Pelosi tearing up the speech while staring at the president of the United States was incredibly childish. it was almost elementary school like, like ‘I hate you this much I’m going to tear up your speech.’ It really shows the partisan tenor that is here.”

U.S. REP. JIM JORDAN, R-Urbana

U.S. REP JOYCE BEATTY, D-Columbus

“President Trump’s State of the Union Address was condescending, full of exaggerations and plenty of rhetoric. Trump’s remarks on education were heartbreaking, with so many public school systems desperately needing additional funding. His healthcare promises come at a time when he and Republicans are fighting in court right now to strip protections for pre-existing conditions; and it was President Obama who set in motion our economic recovery and current growth. Finally, he failed to offer any real solutions, but instead pandered and stoked fear.” - Rep. Beatty is a Dayton native and graduate of Central State University

U.S. REP STEVE CHABOT, R-Cincinnati

“I agree with President Trump that the state of our union is strong. In his first three years in office, President Trump has worked with Congress to enact criminal justice reform to help reintegrate non-violent offenders into society, to stop the importation of fentanyl into our country, and to help strengthen school security. Economically, he has reworked our trade relationships with Mexico and Canada, is in the process of negotiating more favorable terms with China and our allies in Europe, has worked with Congress to simplify the tax code, and tackled the out-of-control regulatory state. Those efforts have helped create a vibrant economy with the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years and the lowest unemployment rate ever for African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans.-Rep. Chabot represents Warren and part of Hamilton County in Congress

U.S. REP. TIM RYAN, D-Youngstown

While the stock market is trucking along for millionaires and billionaires, our economy is broken for every day, hardworking Americans. This President wants to point to the unemployment rate, but nothing will take away from the fact that wages have been stagnant for years, and it’s harder than ever for families to make ends meet — even as they work two or three jobs. President Trump didn’t say one word about how we are going to fix our broken pension system that’s swallowing money owed to hard-working people.

“Manufacturing jobs continue to be shipped overseas. Tuition costs are skyrocketing, and every day Americans are being forced to choose between bankruptcy and lifesaving medicine.
