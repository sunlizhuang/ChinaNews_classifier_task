ISLAMABAD, Jan.22 (China Economic Net) - Federal Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry said recently that technology business will be benefited through China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and Science and Technology is the part of CPEC.

Science and technology is a growing field in Pakistan and has played an important role in the country's development since its founding. Pakistan has a large pool of scientists, engineers, doctors, and technicians assuming an active role in this sector.

China on the other hand has dramatically expanded its technical workforce. From 2000 to 2014, the number of science and engineering graduates increased from 359,000 to 1.65 million, almost a five-fold increase. It is now turning out more trained people than the United States that saw an increase from 483,000 to 742,000 in the same period.

Since both China and Pakistan have been working on various science and technology projects therefore improved cooperation between these two countries will meet new glory in diverse fields including telecommunications, science and technology.

Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement, as well as pledged to ‘China Pakistan Joint Cotton Bio Tech Laboratory’ as part of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor was signed between both the countries. The joint lab was built after signing of MoU between Pakistan and China. This joint venture was aimed to strengthen agriculture and technology ties between the both countries.

The State Oceanic Administration and Pakistan’s Ministry of Science and Technology also established the ‘China-Pakistan Joint Marine Research Centre’.

In November 2018, Chinese Academy of Sciences(CAS) and Higher Education Commission(HEC)of Pakistan signed MOU to promote the construction of China-Pakistan Joint Research Centre on Earth Sciences. As the Chinese representative, IMHE will provide scientific support for the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, jointly respond to natural disasters and promote academic exchanges between China and Pakistan.

As a part of the CPEC agreement, Pakistan and China have also agreed to cooperate in space research. China-Pakistan space cooperation will help Pakistan in terms of satellite monitoring of natural disasters and agricultural production, land and resources surveying, and waste handling in a microgravity environment.

In 2018, China sent two Pakistan satellites into orbit. The PRSS-1, Pakistan's first optical remote sensing satellite, and the PakTES-1A, a smaller observation craft, were both lifted into space by China's Long March-2C (LM-2C) carrier rocket.

Construction began on the US $ 44 million 820 kilometer long Pakistan-China Fiber Optic Project, an optical fiber cable to enhance telecommunication in the Gilgit-Baltistan region, while offering Pakistan a fifth route by which to transmit telecommunication traffic. The project was completed and inaugurated in 2018.

China also build US $ 1.5 Billion National Science & Technology Park under CPEC in Islamabad. The park already has strong international links via participation in the CPEC, and a partnership with the China Pakistan Technology Transfer Centre which seeks to create innovation and investment from many companies located along the corridor.

Through the development of different industrial parks and information technology parks under CPEC, there will be more freedom of firms to locate their economic activities.

New technologies embedded in the projects, which China will be implementing in Pakistan would certainly help but it would be more prudent for Pakistan to ask for explicit Chinese assistance in this area.

Since the Chinese government is heavily involved in selecting the areas of concentration, the country therefore has made impressive progress in artificial intelligence, telecommunications, robotics, electric cars and renewable energy.

Some of these areas could be selected by Pakistan as areas of its own concentration as well and China’s help could be taken in increasing institutional capacity to train the youth of Pakistan.
