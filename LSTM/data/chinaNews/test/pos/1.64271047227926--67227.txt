According to Navneet Damani, Vice President, Motilal Oswal, gold prices held steady after climbing to a one-week peak in the previous session, as concerns about the coronavirus epidemic, which has claimed more than 1,000 lives in China, offset an uptick in equities.

Damani noted that there are steps taken to reduce the overall impact of the virus, although till the time the pace of deaths and affected people do not reduce, so won't the panic in the market. With the onset of the virus, less movement in the bond yields is also supporting gold prices.

The broader trend on the Comex could be $1,560-1,580, and on domestic front prices could hover in the range of Rs 40,100-40,650, said Damani.
