YANAGAWA, Fukuoka -- Accommodation and sightseeing facilities in this southwestern Japan city have been decorated with bright displays of hanging ornaments ahead of "Hinamatsuri," or the Doll Festival, on March 3.

People in the Fukuoka Prefecture city of Yanagawa traditionally hang decorative balls as well as fruit and animal figures as good-luck charms together with "hina" dolls to express their prayers for happiness and the healthy growth of girls. At the "Kanpo no Yado Yanagawa" hotel, 27 sets of colorful decorations and seven tiers of hina dolls were placed in the lobby to welcome visitors.

Various events related to the Doll Festival will be held at local sightseeing facilities and shopping streets when a local festival kicks off on Feb. 11. This year some facilities will hold events from Jan. 24 in accordance with the Chinese New Year, when many tourists visit.
