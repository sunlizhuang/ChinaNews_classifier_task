Chris Barron and Duane Lowry have a very spirited, but still grounded, discussion about Friday's USDA reports and its implications for price action during the next 120 days. If there is an Ag Pitch podcast discussing markets that you don't want to miss; and that you surely will want to listen to its end, this is it!

Also, Duane offers you a special offer near the end of today's podcast! We have potential for significant marketing decisions for both old-crop and 2020 production, and we may face these critical decisions during the next 90 days. China will sign Phase One Wednesday, which we also talk about in an opening manner. Yes, lots to listen to today.

As always, if you have any questions please contact Duane at duanel@netins.net, or Chris at cbarron@agviewsolutions.com. Enjoy!
