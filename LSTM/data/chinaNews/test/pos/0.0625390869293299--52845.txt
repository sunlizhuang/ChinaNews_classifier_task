The University of Oregon has suspended all official travel to China, in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

The UO has also put a temporary halt to its study-abroad programs in China. It made the announcement last week, after the US State Department issued a level 4 advisory not to travel to China because of the fast-spreading coronavirus. There were 7 U of O students in China last week, according to a University spokesperson. In a letter to the campus community, the UO says theyâ€™re coordinating with the students to help them leave China. The letter also reminds people to wash hands and take other precautions to avoid flu and other viruses.
