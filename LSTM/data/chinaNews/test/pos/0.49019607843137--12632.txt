Michelle Obama documentary streaming: Can you watch the full movie online? Is it legal?

To be sure you’re not watching copyrighted material, you should go direct to companies such as Netflix or Amazon Prime, according to FACT (Federation Against Copyright Theft). Adding further to these warnings CEO of FACT Kieron Sharp said: “There are now more ways than ever for consumers to watch movies and TV but not going to legitimate sources to watch new movies is not a grey area: it is against the law. “As well as being illegal, evidence shows that streaming pirated content is incredibly risky and can expose users to malware and inappropriate content. “Not only does that deny the best viewing experience, it’s just not worth taking the chance.”
