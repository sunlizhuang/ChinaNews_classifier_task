On Wednesday, January 15, 2020, the US and China have signed a partial trade deal — aimed at easing the 18-month trade conflict — between the world’s two biggest economies. President Trump and China’s vice premier Liu He attended a ceremony at the White House. Mr Trump said the agreement was a ‘momentous step towards a future of fair and reciprocal trade’ — between the US and China, in the video “US China Trade Deal – BBC News“, below:

President Trump signed a landmark trade agreement with China, heralding a period of detente in a trade war between the world’s two largest economies fueled by decades of complaints that Beijing was manipulating its currency and stealing trade secrets from American firms.
