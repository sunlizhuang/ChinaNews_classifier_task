The two sides should also speed up the implementation of the action plan on building a China-Laos community with a shared future, which will significantly accelerate Laos' socio-economic development, promote the trust and unity between the two countries and help to safeguard their common interests in international arena, he added.

The Lao foreign minister, for his part, while applauding the great efforts China has made to combat the epidemic, said his country will stand firmly with China in this regard. He believed that China will surely win the fight against the disease.

Saleumxay Kommasith said the Lao side has attached great importance to the consensus on forging a China-Laos community with a shared future reached between the leaders of the two countries and has held a high-level meeting on implementing the action plan recently.

Laos will give priority to the implementation of the action plan, broaden the pragmatic cooperation in all fields, push forward the construction of the China-Laos Railway to be completed as planned and advance the construction of the China-Laos Economic Corridor, the Lao foreign minister said.
