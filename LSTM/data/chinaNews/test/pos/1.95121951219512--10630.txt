Bruno said it wasn't any one thing that led to his decision. He mentioned that he didn't think he could commit to another four years of projects to move the university forward. He also mentioned that he hadn't has as much time with his family as he would have liked since he had been serving as president.

Bruno said he was proud of his accomplishments while serving as president of ULM, and he said he was confident the university was moving in the right direction.

"We've taken that first step. As the Chinese proverb says, 'The journey of 1,000 miles begins with the first step.' So I think we're in the early steps of that 1,000 miles. But it's got a very very bright future with some very good people," he said.

Bruno's proposed last day is June 30. In the meantime, a nationwide search will be held in order to find his replacement.
