Huawei’s Mate product line currently includes smartphones, tablets, laptops and other products. Today, according to a certificate found on the European Intellectual Property Office website, Huawei also has something called “MatePod” on the way. The Chinese phone maker did indeed trademark the name on the European certification platform.

Huawei MatePod Certified in Europe – High-End TWS Earphones Coming Soon?

As if the name didn’t already give it away, the certificate for the “MatePod” was applied in the category “headsets; earphones”. Which means we’re almost certainly talking about a pair of TWS earphones.

At present, Huawei’s FreeBuds, represent the company’s option in the quickly grown TWS (True Wireless Headphones) market. Huawei also trademarked a product called NovaBuds in late 2019, that product was never launched though. So, the newly found certificate could mean the brand has decided to enter the high-end segment of TWS earphones, following companies the likes of Apple with their premium AirPods Pro selling for $250.

Reports from China also suggest the Huawei MatePod might launch along with the Huawei P40 series. That said, it would make more sense for the Chinese brand to release them at the same time as the next Huawei Mate 40 series; thus in the second half of 2020.

What’s certain is that the “Mate” moniker means serious business. We’re talking about the best technology the market has to offer, even if that means increasing the price. So, if you’re looking for a real Apple AirPods Pro alternative, the Huawei MatePod are probably what you should be waiting for.
