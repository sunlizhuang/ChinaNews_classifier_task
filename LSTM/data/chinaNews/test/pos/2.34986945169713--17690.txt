Ruby Li and Lilian Liu, 8, learning to make sweet dumplings at a cooking lesson to celebrate the Chinese New Year and strengthen cultural ties.

Family recipes are proving to be a palatable link to the past as Manawatū's Chinese community celebrate their heritage.

Thirty people gathered around tables of pastry to learn how to make traditional Chinese sweet dumplings and ribbon biscuits on Wednesday as part of Chinese New Year celebrations.

Volunteers from the Manawatū Chinese Association ran the free, booked-out workshop, honouring the Year of the Rat by teaching participants about traditional Chinese culture and cooking.

Committee member Angel Kwan had been taught the recipes by senior members of the group in December so they could then continue to be passed down to younger generations.

DAVID UNWIN/STUFF Christina Leong, 17, and CC Zheng, 21, find the cooking lesson an enjoyable way to reconnect with their heritage.

"We wanted to share our happiness to the people, so they can have a go."

Kwan said it meant a lot for her, and her generation, to be able to pass down traditional recipes.

"I have children and I don't have anything I can teach them. But I can learn it from the seniors and I can pass it down to other people and my children."

CC Zheng, 21, has grown up in New Zealand. She said the workshop were a great way for her to reconnect with her heritage and to revisit values and traditions that may have been lost.

DAVID UNWIN/STUFF Care is taken to mold the dumplings into the correct shape.

"I think it is very humbling to know that we have a community here. People are very accepting and curious, some of the people here are not from a Chinese background."

Zheng said the Chinese New Year was about reconnecting with family and making more of an effort to get to know her culture.

Norelle Ward said her daughter Emileigh, 11, was learning Japanese at school, and was looking for other ways to keep learning about other cultures and traditions.

"It's about finding ways to experiment with other cultures that is respecful."

As part of Chinese New Year celebrations, the Happy Lunar Festival is on this Saturday in The Square, in Palmerston North, from 11am to 2pm. Features include performances, lantern making and food stalls.
