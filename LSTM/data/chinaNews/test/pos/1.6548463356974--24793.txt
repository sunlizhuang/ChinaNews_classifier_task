Vince Hill wasn’t going to just let anyone walk in and take over his longtime coffee shop in downtown Belmont.

Majid Amoorpour took the reins from Hill’s Caravan Coffee & Dessert Bar, located at 7 Main St., after working for Hill and slowly taking over Caravan’s baking operation since last year. He reopened the shop on Jan. 10 after a brief yet detail renovation including freshly painted walls and a new ceiling, countertop and display cases.

“Get his story and it will impress you as it did me,” Hill said.

Vince and Brenda Hill, who still own the building, leased the building to Amoorpour. Now named The Everyday Market, Amoorpour hopes to keep the same atmosphere as Caravan, while soon adding savory snacks, sandwiches, beer and wine to the market’s offerings.

At age 21, Amoorpour walked from restaurant to restaurant in search of a job to pay for art school. He eventually changed career paths, as he climbed the chain from dishwasher at a Chinese restaurant to working with Swedish chef Mats Persson.

He’s lived in and out of Charlotte since 1999, working under Michelin-recommended restaurants in England and Chicago, pastry chef for Charlotte’s now-closed Noble’s Restaurant and South Park’s Caf� Monte.

Amoorpour opened his first restaurant, Bistro La Bon, in 2010 in Charlotte’s Plaza Midwood neighborhood. Through Kris Reid, co-founder of the Piedmont Culinary Guild, Amoorpour heard about the Hill’s desire to retire.

“I’d never been to Belmont before then,” Amoorpour said. “The first time I came here, I was like… this is great. I just kind of fell in love with it.”

Amoorpour doesn’t want to intimidate customers with his culinary background. He just wants to continue building upon the Hill’s legacy created in their 17 years. In fact, Amoorpour kept Caravan’s employees, who are trained to continue crafting coffee and pastry creations.

“I can make good food without being fancy… I just translate it to something everybody can afford,” Amoorpour said. “I want to be a neighborhood joint. People we’ll be able to come in and hang out.”

Local foods play a big part in Amoorpour’s cooking. That’ll continue at The Everyday Market, as he plans to offer fruit and take-home meals from nearby food companies, such as Charlotte’s Pasta & Provisions.

Customers can also expect a bigger version of The Everyday Market in the year, as Amoorpour expands the bar and seating into Brenda Hill’s former cake shop.
