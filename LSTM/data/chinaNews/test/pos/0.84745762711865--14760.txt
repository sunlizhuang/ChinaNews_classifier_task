TRURO, N.S. —

Cumberland-Colchester MP Lenore Zann has been named to Parliament’s Special Committee on Canada-China Relations.

Zann’s top priority is securing the release of Canadian prisoners Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who have been detained by China for more than a year.

“We have two Canadians detained in China and they are at the forefront of my mind,” said Zann via text message Jan. 16. “We need to get them home safe and sound as quickly as possible. This will take great diplomatic effort on the part of our government.”

The job of the Special Committee on China-Canada Relations is examining and reviewing all aspects of relations between Ottawa and Beijing. These include diplomatic, economic, trade, security and other issues impacting ties between the countries.

However, Zann aims to keep human rights on the committee’s agenda, pointing to Beijing’s mass detention of Uyghur Muslims in western China.

“The mistreatment of Muslims is sadly a human rights concern in many countries around the world, not only in China,” said Zann. “It is of great concern to me and my colleagues.”

The special committee is made up of 12 MPs, including six Liberals, four Conservatives, one NDP and one Bloc Québécois member.

It was first formed on Dec. 10 last year. Zann formally joined the committee in Ottawa earlier this week.
