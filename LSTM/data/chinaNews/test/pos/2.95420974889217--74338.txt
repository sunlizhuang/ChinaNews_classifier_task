Hakkasan Mayfair is the only sequel since The Godfather Part II to improve on the original. The thrill of the first Hakkasan restaurant lay in the incongruity of its sultry glamour juxtaposed with its grimy setting in Hanway Place. The pleasure of this Mayfair follow-up, which celebrates its tenth birthday this year, resides in the fact that it feels completely at home in its luxe address.

Snobs carp that these days Hakkasan Hanway Place has become a bit bridge and tunnel. The only tunnel that Hakkasan Mayfair’s glossy clientele ever encounter, however, is the underpass at Hyde Park Corner en route from their London residences in Knightsbridge and Belgravia.

I love the mirror hanging above the staircase to the basement dining room, in which you catch your reflection shimmering in the dusky, blue-hued penumbra. Few other restaurants create such a sense of leaving the outside world behind, as if you were disappearing under water or passing from day to night.

The large dining room, throbbing with chatter and clatter, is divided by carved oriental screens, tables spot-lit in the gloaming by lights dangling above each table. Despite the insistent thrum of the nightclub beats, eavesdropping is easy; come in a group bigger than a couple and you’ll find yourself broadcasting your business to the whole restaurant.

The culinary approach refines all the familiar elements of the clichéd Anglo-Chinese menu with dazzling flashes of originality. The ribs are smoked with jasmine tea and the sweet and sour is made with Duke of Berkshire pork. Roast duck is flavoured with black truffle to enhance the savoury, soothing quality of juicy meat swaddled in fatty skin.
