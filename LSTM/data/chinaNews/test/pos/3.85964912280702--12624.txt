Presiding over, the Minister for Education, Science and Technology, Prof Joyce Ndalichako thanked the envoy for the support, saying: "There is a great input from Chinese constructors in realizing the new school's existence.

I laud the government, and organisations as well as private institutions in Arusha, which pulled together resources towards the construction of this school. "The government will support their initiative by adding two dormitories, one being for boys and girls. The State will also ensure that it gets upgraded to Advance Levels so that students from other parts of the country would also be enrolled here in future," said the Minister.

On his part, Arusha Regional Commissioner (RC), Mrisho Gambo pointed out that the assistance would motivate many students to enroll there, adding that community members should ensure they exploit the opportunity.
