Chinese tenor Yongzhao Yu launched his professional opera career three years ago in the role of Roldolfo in Puccini’s “La Boheme.”

This weekend, he recreates it with Arizona Opera.

For Yu, the opportunity to play Rodolfo again on Sunday, Feb. 2, is an opportunity to see the character from another dimension.

“Rodolfo is the first role which started my career, so it means a lot to me,” Yu said in an email interview last week, the day before the production opened in Phoenix. “Rodolfo is an optimistic young man. He aspires love even (as) he was always very poor. But the more I sing the more I feel his other character.”

Yu and Guatemalan tenor Mario Chang, who also sings the role of Rodolfo for the Arizona Opera’s production, are here as part of the Tucson Desert Song Festival, which runs through Feb. 16. Chang will take part in the Saturday, Feb. 1, show. His Arizona debut is one of several Yu will have this season including with Seattle Opera singing the role of Duke of Mantua in “Rigoletto.”

Yu also will return to New York’s Metropolitan Opera, where he is on the “cover” roster — the equivalent of an understudy in theater — for the Rodolfo role. It will be his second shot at getting on the Met’s storied stage.
