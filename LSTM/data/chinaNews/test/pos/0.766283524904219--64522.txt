PETALING JAYA: The hard work and tenacity of the Chinese government in dealing with the novel coronavirus has dispelled all doubts that the country will be unable to contain the epidemic, says MCA.

Its secretary-general Datuk Chong Sin Woon said the action taken by the Chinese government to quell the spread of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has gradually shown to be effective.

"The self-sacrificing volunteers and health workers deserve nothing but the highest of respect; we bid them all to stay safe in the war against coronavirus," he said in a statement on Monday (Feb 10).

He said that China responded by exhibiting a high level of transparency in terms of their progress and the sharing of information, with this quickly winning the country aid from all around the world as materials, medicines and volunteers poured in.

"We believe as long as the world stays united, and push aside nationality and ethnicity in this battle, we will no doubt break free of despotism of the coronavirus and return everyone to their everyday peaceful and healthy lives once more," said Chong.

He also noted the efforts of the National Disaster Management Agency (Nadma), that coordinated efforts to bring back 141 of our citizens trapped in Wuhan, and supplied 500,000 pairs of rubber gloves to China.

"Moreover, 10 Malaysian companies banded together and contributed another 18 million surgical gloves to the medical staff of Wuhan. It is tremendously heart-warming to witness our people's capacity to show love at a time of crisis," said Chong.
