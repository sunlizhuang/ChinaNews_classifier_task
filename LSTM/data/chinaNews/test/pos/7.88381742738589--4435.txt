DAKAR, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- As part of the "Joyful Spring Festival" celebrations for the upcoming Chinese New Year, a dance and music gala was held here on Thursday evening.

Organized by the Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism and Senegalese Ministry of Culture and Communication, the artists from China's northwestern province of Gansu put on a fabulous show for more than 700 people, including Chinese living in Senegal, Senegalese and foreign diplomats.

The artists not only showcased the charm of Silk Road with dances and musics of Dunhuang style, but also cooperated with Senegalese artists to perform a piece of traditional Senegalese music.

In his opening speech, Chinese Ambassador to Senegal Zhang Xun said bilateral relations have entered the best period in history, as China and Senegal are the co-chairs of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.

The two countries continue to deepen and enhance exchanges and cooperation in various fields, Zhang added.

He called on the Chinese and Senegalese people to work together in 2020 for further alignment of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative with the Plan for an Emerging Senegal.

For his part, Senegalese Minister of Culture and Communication Abdoulaye Diop decribed the cultural relations between China and Senegal as exemplary, saying that cultural exchanges will bring people together and deepen mutual respect.

He also reaffirmed that Senegal is willing to continue mutually beneficial cooperation with China.
