Newark, NJ, Feb. 03, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As per the report published by Fior Markets, the global automated test equipment market is expected to grow from USD 3.91 Billion in 2017 to USD 5.97 Billion by 2025 at a CAGR of 5.43% during the forecast period 2018-2025.

Reduced manufacturing time due to the high testing speed of ATE and the rise in demand for consumer electronics goods like laptops, tablets, smartphones, and others have fuelled the demand for ATE. Growing implementation system-on-chip which is owing to rising demand for consumer electronics also drives automated test equipment. Demand for ATE has been stimulated due to the miniaturization of devices.

Automatic test equipment or automated test equipment (ATE) is a computer-operated machine that conducts tests on devices, like electronics, hardware, software, semiconductors or avionics, to measure their performance and ability. These tests are known as the Device Under Test (DUT), Equipment Under Test (EUT) or Unit Under Test (UUT), which use various controlling methods and automated technology to rapidly generate outcomes related to efficiency of the device by evaluating DUT. Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) is also defined as any equipment used to perform assembly line type testing of produced items. Most commonly the term is used for the equipment that is used in testing integrated circuits and printed circuit boards, in the manufacturing process.

These tests can be simple or complex depending upon the nature of the equipment tested. It involves the use of wireless communication and radar as well as electronic component manufacturing. Thus, ATE helps to quickly identify the working capability of DUT which saves manufacturing costs and prevents a faulty device from entering the market.

The ability of automated test equipment systems to manufacture in less timing is a major factor driving the market. The adoption of new techniques requires new ATE which may act as a constraint for the market. However, growth in the automotive sector along with the rising demand of consumers might boost the market in the coming years.
