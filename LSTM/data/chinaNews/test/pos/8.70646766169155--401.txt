For the best herbal medicine, use natural and pollution-free ingredients.

The Maori ancestors were great navigators and explorers, they found the beautiful and plentiful New Zealand on the rough Pacific Ocean. Since the introduction of deer by the European settlers, New Zealand has become a large deer-raising country.

The unparalleled environmental conditions breed strong and active red deer herds, producing the highest quality deer products.

Deer has many hidden treasures, its medicinal values is believed by traditional Chinese herbology to be throughout the body. In particular, the use of deer velvet has a long history in oriental Asia. It is recognised as one of the most treasured Chinese herbal medicine for anti-aging and overall well-being.

The earliest silk scroll unearthed in the ancient tombs of the Western Han Dynasty in Hunan Province has recorded deer velvet as a health tonic. By the time of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Li Shizhen's famous "Compendium of Materia Medica" has provided more detailed analysis. In modern Chinese Pharmacopoeia and deer agencies in South Korea, Japan and New Zealand, scientific researches are conducted to further supported its benefits.
