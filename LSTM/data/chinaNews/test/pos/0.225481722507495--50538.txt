The country will still have a sizeable presence at the weeklong event with company officials already based in the country stepping in.Still, the last-minute decision has meant the cancellation of several vendor meetings, said people with knowledge of the matter. This follows China advising people not to embark on trips given the health emergency.Chang’an Automobile, which is exploring local manufacturing in India, had been expected to send a large team to study the Indian market more closely.A Great Wall Motors vendor meet on February 5 has been scrapped. “Till last night, the meeting with partners was open,” said one of the persons. “But the decision might have been taken on Monday. In China, the executives have been advised to work from home and not venture out. The absence is understandable, but Auto Expo will go on as per schedule.”The death toll from the outbreak stands at 362, with more than 17,459 infected by the virus, the Guardian reported on Monday.Chinese companies such as MG Motor, Great Wall, FAW Haima and BYD are taking part in the show for the first time, helping to bolster the biennial motor show’s profile at a time when major multinational carmakers such as Toyota, Honda Ford and Nissan have decided to give the expo a miss. The cars to be displayed were shipped weeks in advance, the people said.The stands of Great Wall, China’s largest SUV maker, and MG Motor will be well-staffed since they have a number of executives based in India, said the persons.
