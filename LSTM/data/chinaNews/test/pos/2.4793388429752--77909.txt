Firstly, let me start with a word of thanks to you. At this time every year, we publish our official sales figures – just as the car industry does. The magazine ABCs let you know which titles are doing well, and which aren’t. This year was a particularly good one for Auto Express in what is, let’s face it, a challenging market.

We proud to say that we’re still Britain’s biggest-selling weekly car magazine, and by a bigger margin than before. That’s down to you. We’re hugely grateful for your ongoing support and will continue to ensure we’re the best at what we do – for you. As always, please do keep the feedback coming.

This week’s cover star is from a new brand that sits under the Volvo umbrella. Only last week I was over in Sweden talking about, amongst other things, electrification. I spotted a few Polestar models being driven around and they look sensational. Now we’re able to bring you our first-drive verdict on the brand’s new Polestar 2 – a rival for Tesla’s big-selling Model 3.

After the launch of the hybrid Polestar 1, the new Swedish/Chinese brand has committed to being fully electric. And there will be plenty more new brands gracing the pages of Auto Express in the coming weeks and months, all with electrification at their core.
