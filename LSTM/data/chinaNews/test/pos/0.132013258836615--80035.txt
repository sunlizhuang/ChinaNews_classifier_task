Local resident’s husband detained in China

ALFRED — Shengchun “Sophie” Luo is enlisting the community’s help in bringing her husband home.

Sophie Luo said her husband, Ding Jiaxi, was among a group detained by Chinese police investigating a December gathering in Xiamen. He has been held since Dec. 26 by Chinese authorities cracking down on human rights activists, Sophie Luo said.

Sophie Luo detailed her husband’s plight Monday night at Alfred University’s Holmes Auditorium. Sophie Luo and her young family arrived in Alfred as she pursued her master’s degree in AU’s ceramic engineering department. The couple had another child in Alfred and Sophie Luo still resides in the village.

Jiaxi was a “young and ambitious commercial lawyer” when they moved to America, Sophie Luo said, but Jiaxi’s concerns soon shifted to human rights. He returned to China and became involved in the New Citizens’ Movement.

“Everything here impressed him so much,” recalled Sophie Luo, who obtained her master’s from AU in 2003. “When I look back, I realize that visiting Alfred has actually sowed the seeds of Jiaxi’s desire to pursue change in China. At the beginning of 2010, Jiaxi met some criminal lawyers who worked on the appeal cases of mistreated people, such as those whose houses were taken away by the government without decent compensation, those whose kids were not allowed to go to school due to their parents’ involvement in human rights activities, and those who worked for Chinese NGOs that struggled due to the tightening up by the government.”

Jiaxi and about 20 others participated in the December meeting. Sophie Luo said four fled to the United States, five entered hiding in China, and six were detained. Jiaxi was among four placed under secret detention. The group also included a professor, a senior finance manager, and a factory worker, Sophie Luo detailed.

Jiaxi has been detained before, but Sophie Luo said the Chinese authorities have completely disregarded the rule of law in this instance, marking a troubling trend for the nation.

“Comparing the two detentions of Jiaxi, I can see clearly the deterioration of human rights these last seven years,” Sophie Luo said. “When he was detained the first time, although we knew Jiaxi was completely innocent, we knew they were trying to impose a crime on him, they still did it according to legal procedure. They gave notice, they allowed a lawyer to meet him and went through a trial. These detentions are just like an abduction. The authorities are completely disregarding the legal system and doing whatever they want.”

Jiaxi’s disappearance has been declared an urgent action issue by Amnesty International, said Alfred University faculty member Rob Reginio, drawing applause from the crowd.

“The eyes of the world are now on this issue, which is really uplifting,” Reginio said. “(Jiaxi) courageously sacrificed for rights and privileges that we as Americans just take for granted — the ability to meet with like-minded friends and talk about politics. This is why Jiaxi is currently in secret detention. Those sorts of rights that go without thought in our minds are precious to the people of China.”

The Alfred community has rallied to Sophie Luo’s side. Much of the crowd at Monday’s event signed petitions urging Jiaxi’s release, including Alfred University President Mark Zupan. The petitions will be sent to American political leaders and Chinese officials, all of whom have been made aware of the matter.

“I love my husband,” Sophie Luo said. “Although we have been separated so many years, I have never stopped loving him. I know he is a wonderful person. He is full of love for his family, for his friends and everyone around him. I know very well that he didn’t do anything against anyone. His rights need to be ensured.”

Sophie Luo has also received support from her church family in Alfred, taking Jiaxi’s story to social media. She told the crowd they can help bring him home by circulating the petitions and spreading the news of his detention.

“If the erosion of human rights in China is not stopped, it will become a threat to the international society just like the coronavirus to international health,” Sophie Luo said. “Dear friends, we really must stop this deterioration of human rights in China, now.”

As for her own personal safety, Sophie Luo said America gives her hope.

“I feel safe. I believe I will apply to be an American citizen someday,” she said. “I’m proud of this country. I love this country.”
