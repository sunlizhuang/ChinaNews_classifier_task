AuMake said in that statement that the Broadway management team were experienced in managing ''significant disruptions in the travel industry'' after dealing with the SARS epidemic in 2003.

AuMake shares were 3.6 per cent lower at 8.1¢ on Tuesday afternoon, a record low. The $7 million placement last year to held fund the Broadway buy was struck at 16¢ per share. AuMake listed on the ASX in 2017 and had jumped as high as 79¢ in December, 2017 before steadily falling lower.

While AuMake generates most of its revenue from Chinese tourists arriving in Australia and looking for a one-stop shop to buy products such as health supplements, vitamins, infant formula, skincare products and honey, it has built up a growing online sales arm.

AuMake said in a quarterly update on January 23 that online sales now made up around 30 per cent of its revenues.

It also said that store visits by Chinese tourists to the Broadway outlets in the December quarter had risen by 120 per cent, with the group tapping into an expanded number of Chinese travel agents and tour operators.

The existing AuMake stores had produced a 22 per cent rise in same-store sales over the previous corresponding period. Total revenue for AuMake in the December quarter had more than doubled to $26 million.

The company also said that it had started doing business with Korean travel agents and anticipated that Korean tourist numbers to its stores would rise in 2020. It is also encouraging Japanese tourists into its stores.

Last year, AuMake signalled that about 50 per cent of the trade in the existing AuMake stores stemmed from inbound tourists, and 50 per cent from daigou traders who were buying large volumes of products to sell online in China.

Chinese tourists spend an average of $3500 on their trips to Australia, with about 25 per cent of it on skin care items, health products and gifts. Tourism industry data shows 1.4 million Chinese tourists come to Australia annually.
