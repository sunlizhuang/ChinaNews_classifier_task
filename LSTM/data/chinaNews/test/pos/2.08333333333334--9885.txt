WASHINGTON, Jan 15, 2020 (BSS/AFP) – President Donald Trump signed a long-awaited “phase one” trade deal with China on Wednesday, which includes a massive increase in exports to the Asian economic power.

China agreed to buy $200 billion more in US goods over two years than it did in 2017 before the trade war erupted, according to the agreement signed Wednesday.

That includes an additional $32 billion in American farm products and seafood, nearly $78 billion in manufactured goods like aircraft, machinery and steel, and $52 billion in energy products.
