'The idea was to spend a few weeks in Venice, both working and playing' (stock photo)

This day next week I'll be nearing journey's end. And what started as a bit of a wheeze of an idea many months ago will actually have come to pass.

The idea was to spend a few weeks in Venice, both working and playing. Nothing unusual there, for I've done it many times over the years, spending a month or six weeks at a time there in a city I know like the back of my hand, and in the place where my husband Gerry and I spent many, many happy days and weeks, from our very first visit in 1995 right up to our last sojourn there, just a few months before his death in the summer of 2015.

So when I first told friends I was planning to head off again for the month of March they looked at me quizzically, as if to say: "So what? Sure, you're always going there."
