OXFORD, Ohio – Test results found that two Miami University students who traveled to China over the January break did not have the novel coronavirus, and they have been released from a week's isolation, public health officials said Sunday.

"This is good news indeed," said Jennifer Bailor, Butler County health director, at a news conference called just hours after she and state health officials learned the results of the testing.

Had the result been positive, the cases would have been the first in Ohio. As of Sunday night, the United States has counted nine cases of the novel coronavirus that was first detected in early December. More than 300 people have died worldwide, and more than 14,000 have been sick from the new virus.

The immediate reaction among Miami students ranged from relief to shrugs.

“There was kind of more jokes about it because the Department of Health sent an email every day so it was kind of more annoying," said Frannie Thoman, a freshman who is a kinesiology major.

Miami University officials, with Bailor and state health director Dr. Amy Acton, announced Jan. 25. that the two students had been tested and isolated. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is the only facility that can do the testing right now.

The two students returned to Miami last weekend from a trip to China during the university’s January break. One student, a Chinese national, visited the university's Student Health Service on Jan 24, complaining of flu-like symptoms.

On Sunday, Bailor and Acton commended the students for responding quickly when they realized they weren't feeling well. "These students did everything right," Bailor said. "They took very, very prompt action in reporting their symptoms to the student health services just as soon as possible."

The student and his traveling companion told health officials about their travels. Health authorities tested them for the coronavirus and instructed them to stay home. Officials had food delivered to them.

Bailor declined to give many details about the students, citing the fact that Oxford is a small town and the legal need to keep their identities private. But she did say that one of the students "probably" traveled to Wuhan, the Chinese city that is the focus of the outbreak.

Many Miami students weren’t too concerned by the potential cases of coronavirus.

“People on the internet were acting like there was an epidemic at Miami that was just spreading from person to person like we were all coughing and sneezing and shooting blood out of our ears,” said Drew Cavanaugh, a freshman who is a games and simulation major. “We weren’t super worried.”

But other students constantly checked their emails and social media, hoping for an update on the results.

“When I get a health update, my heart drops, like is it–? And then (the email’s) just like ‘We’re just checking in,’ ” said Sophia Rosen, a freshman political science major.

“I was ‘Oh my God,’ especially with (sorority) rush going down and school’s just starting, I didn’t know if we were gonna be under lockdown or if they were gonna close the dining halls or stop classes, so it’s just really nice that we don’t have to worry about that,” Rosen said.

Katie Hands, a freshman with an undeclared major. said she was scared. "I mean, I didn’t really think that we would have it, but just the fact that it was said was scary.”

Acton spent much of the Tuesday news conference trying to calm fears on campus, especially after the Miami men’s and women’s basketball games were postponed due to the concerns about the illness.

“Only with that travel history (to China) or with a direct contact with someone under investigation are you truly at risk," Acton said Tuesday.

On Sunday, when releasing the test results, Acton again emphasized that the risk was low in Ohio for the incidence of the coronavirus.

Miami University has 17,327 undergraduate and 2,607 graduate students on its Oxford campus, which is about about 35 miles north of Cincinnati. Students from China are the university's largest population of international students with 2,334 enrolled.

The illness did not become a public health problem in China until after Miami dismissed classes for the fall semester, so university officials did not think to warn students before they left campus.

Health officials advised Miami students and faculty to take precautions that are customary in flu season, including washing hands with hot water and soap and coughing or sneezing into an elbow. Wearing masks was not necessary, although some students used them anyway.

Coronaviruses, named for the crown-like spikes on their surfaces, are common in animals; this one apparently jumped to humans sometime in December.

In Wuhan, the initial outbreak reportedly had a link to a large seafood and animal market but is now spreading person to person, according to the CDC. Chinese health authorities are struggling to gain control of the illness’ spread.

At least 305 deaths have been attributed to the illness worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Only 1% of the roughly 14,500 cases confirmed worldwide are outside China, the WHO said Sunday.

As of Friday, the CDC was investigating 241 people in 36 states – including the two Miami students – for possible cases of coronavirus. About 6% of the suspected American cases have returned positive results.
