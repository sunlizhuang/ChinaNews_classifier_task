AS you’re reading this column, written on Saturday, January 18, I will be out of town doing my job as presidential special envoy.

My staff and I at “Isumbong Mo Kay Tulfo” — along with five doctors and staff from the Chinese General Hospital and Medical Center — are about to embark on a medical and relief mission to San Pascual, Batangas.





We learned that the Taal Volcano evacuees at the San Pascual had been given the least attention, which is why we chose the place.

Ramon Tulfo, Good Samaritan Foundation has set aside P1 million to buy assorted canned goods, coffee, biscuits and rice, mats, underwear, toothbrushes, face towel, vitamin C in bottles and tablets, cough medicine, face masks, and feeding supply which we will cook for 278 families, or 1,000 individuals (more or less).

The foundation has received donations and pledges for the Taal Volcano evacuees and I would like to acknowledge them and their donations:

– Niño Lim, P100,000 cash

– Alex Tuscano, P200,000 cash

– James Kumar, 1,000 pieces of blankets and 1,000 hygiene kits

– Elo Escueta, P30,000

– Lt. Gen. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, policemen escorts

– Sammy Po, EQ diapers

– Ernesto Bravo, vitamin C and cough syrup

– Edward Cabangon, 1,300 blankets and 500 towels

– Tulfo’s “Angels,” 10 bags of donated clothes

– Pulan Magpantay, 2,000 boiled eggs

– Dr. James Dy, eight volunteer doctors and staff

– Glen Garces, P5,000

– “Isumbong Mo kay Tulfo” listeners, used clothes

– Joey Sarasola, P50,000 and 10-wheeler truck to load relief items

– Freddie Lao, P50,000

– Linda Alcantara Amon, used shoes and clothes

– Kristal Magnaye, used clothes

– SM Foundation, 1,000 slippers, 2,004 bottled water and bags of groceries

– San Miguel Corp., hundreds of boxes of canned goods

– Lucio Co, hundreds of boxes of canned goods

– Ramon Lee, P50,000

– Richard Skaggs, used clothings from the United States.

The rest of the relief goods that cannot be accommodated in Joey Sarasola’s donated 10-wheeler truck will be distributed to other Taal evacuees at a later date.

If you have donations, please contact Alin Ferrer or Minette Lopez of ”Isumbong Mo kay Tulfo” at 0927-348-1697 and 0928-969-9702.

Your donations will be duly receipted and acknowledged in this column and on my Facebook page.

Your donation, no matter how small, will mean the survival of the hundreds of thousands of people in Batangas, Cavite, Laguna and Tagaytay City who have escaped the raging volcano.

As the days progress, there will be more evacuees as Taal has not erupted in all its fury.

These are the times we should help our hapless brethren.

There are many other groups, individuals and organizations that are undertaking relief and medical missions for the Taal Volcano evacuees.

Needless to say, whatever help we give — money, goods and time — will come back to us a hundredfold.

Karma, good or bad, comes back to us when we least expect it.

That is the way of the universe.
