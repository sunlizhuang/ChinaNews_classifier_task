The Changchun IBP, which is based in Changchun City in Jilin Province, has placed an order for the installation of four secondary stage incubators with capacities of 200,000 eggs per week each. Shanghai IBP will receive seven NatureForm Phoenix single-stage secondary stage incubators, each with a capacity of 156,000 eggs per week.

The Shanghai IBP and the Changchun IBP were both founded in the 1940s and are renowned multi-award winning research and production facilities for a range of biological and pharmaceutical products to improve human health, including viral vaccines.

Hen’s eggs play a central role in producing flu vaccines. In the secondary stage incubators, hatching eggs are incubated for vaccine production, after inoculation with flu virus – by injection through the shell and membrane into the egg-white.

NatureForm and Royal Pas Reform – the world’s leading incubation partnership, providing complete hatchery solutions that are based on decades of research into the biological and physiological aspects of embryo development – have more than fifteen years’ experience in the vaccines market.

Steve Warren, CEO of NatureForm Hatchery Technologies, based in Jacksonville Florida, said: “NatureForm is very proud of our participation in these very important projects.

“Our advanced technologies, straightforward design, and expert technical guidance yield better vaccines and increased efficiency around the entire process – with the added benefit of our experience handling the regulatory and procedural paperwork associated with vaccine incubation projects.”

The projects are due to be shipped in late Q1 and Q2 2020.
