UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy on Thursday said that China will continue to support and facilitate the Libyan political settlement process, while noting that the current priority for the country is to achieve sustained ceasefire.

"As a permanent member of the Security Council, China will continue to support and facilitate the Libyan political settlement process, support Libyans' pursuit of peace and tranquility, and contribute to bringing back a peaceful and stable Libya," Wu Haitao, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, told the Security Council meeting on the situation in Libya.

Noting that the current priority is to achieve sustained ceasefire, the envoy said that parties to the Libyan conflict should proceed from the overall interests of their country and people, and aim for an immediate ceasefire to ease tensions, and return to the track of finding a solution through peaceful dialogue and consultation.

"Countries with influence should play an active role by exerting their influence, pushing the Libyan parties to bridge their differences and enhance mutual trust, and providing constructive assistance in bringing about a ceasefire and restoring political dialogue," he said. Enditem
