South Korean male citizens are required to enlist in the military between the ages of 18 and 28. In the past, Korean male citizens could delay their military service until the age of 30 (Korean age).

In August 2018, it was decided, however, the maximum age at which assistance could delay was lowered at the age of 28, which means male idols who are born on 1992 will turn 28 this year, and they will soon have to fulfil their national duty.

Due to the number of speculations, both 1991 and 1992 liners have to enlist in 2020, this list assumed from the records last year with idols that were not able to join last year.

Based on those enlistments, only celebrities born in 1991 are required and must enlist in 2020 around their birthdays. Many idols born 1991 have already decided to join earlier in 2019 just like Infinite Woohyun, U-KISS Hoon and Kiseop. With that, here are some of the remaining idols who must enlist in 2020:

EXO Suho, Chen, Chanyeol and Baekhyun

While Xiumin and D.O have announced that they will be joining the military last year, another four members have the chances to have their enlistment next year. Suho, born on May 22, 1991, will be 29 this year and has to enrol for recruitment as well as for Chen, Chanyeol, and Baekhyun, who will turn 28, though they can delay their service until 2021 if they will prefer.

The maknae line, Kai together with Seh should join until 2023, as Lay does not need to as he is Chinese.

F.T. Island's Jaejin

This group has often discussed wanting to enlist together. Since Lee Hong Ki and Lee Jaejin will be required to go to the military this year, Seunghyun and Minhwan's service might overlap their older members, depending on when they will be enlisted.

WINNER's Jinwoo and Lee Seunghoon

This year, Lee Seunghoon will be turning 28 years old in January, and to comply with the rule, he might also enlist. And on January 11, Lee Seunghoon is one of the eldest in the 92 liners which will celebrate on this day, despite being the second eldest member of WINNER.

Since older member Kim Jinwoo, their oldest member who was supposed to enter the military this year got delayed, so he has to join the military as well probably this year. WINNER also recently made a comeback with the song "Ah Yeah."

B1A4's Sandeul and Baro

Following CNU, who enlisted earlier last year, and Jinyoung, who recently announced his enlistment date, Sandeul and Baro will be the next B1A4 members who will go to the military. Recent news is that Sandeul made a solo comeback with the song "One Fine Day."

MONSTA X's Shownu

Although, the members of this group from Starship Entertainment are all relatively close in age, and Shownu being the eldest member of MONSTA X, will likely start the group's enlistment.
