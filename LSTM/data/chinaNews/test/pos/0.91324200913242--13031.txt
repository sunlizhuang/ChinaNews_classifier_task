The North Face Urban Exploration has just announced that its Spring/Summer 2020 collection, named "The Future City," will be released in five capsule collections.

This nickname is derived from the FUTURELIGHT technology that the company pioneered and launched last year. Incorporating the technology into more modern and city looks, the first unisex 10-piece capsule collection will include the classic Mountain Light jacket in an aptly named Capsule 01 - Mountain Light Reimagined drop occurring in two parts in both January and March.
