In the 13 years that Shen Yun has been performing, it has grown to encompass seven companies touring the world simultaneously.

Monty Mou, a principal dancer, attributes Shen Yun’s popularity to the inspiration and direction it takes from the moral and spiritual depth of China’s 5000-year-old traditional culture.

“It is divinely inspired, so everyone in the world can relate to it as well. Our faith and beliefs help us be successful and help us connect to our audience,” Monty said on his arrival in New Zealand.

Shen Yun’s classical dancers bring to its audience traditional and modern narratives with moral, ethical, and spiritual themes as well as folk dances from China’s many ethnic groups.

“We stress group, not individuality, says Monty. We do not vie for personal recognition. Also, we are not afraid to focus on topics that are happening in China today.”

Monty Mou was referring to the persecution which has been inflicted upon the spiritual practitioners of Falun Dafa, in China, for over 20 years. Falun Dafa is an ancient cultivation practice that stresses and upholds the values of truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance.

“A lot of the reviews show that people are thankful that they have been exposed to the moral and divine and … after watching the show say … it helps them become a better person and the world a better place,” Monty said.

Shen Yun’s East-West Orchestra

The dancers are accompanied by Shen Yun’s unique orchestra—a combination of Western and traditional Chinese instruments.

“Traditional Chinese believe that playing music helps to gain better health. The music confers positive energy and leaves the audience feeling uplifted,” she said

“Sometimes, the audience knows very little about Chinese culture. During the show, there is talk of the divine and the divine inspiration. They [the audience] discover that the Chinese culture is very special and very precious, and it brings back morality to humankind.”

“We can see the expressions on the audiences’ faces—that they are deeply moved by the scenes that are portrayed during the performance.

“I would certainly encourage people to come and see the performance as they will be amazed and blown away by the music, dance, backdrops, and the beautiful costumes—Shen Yun portrays hope,” Tiffany said.
