BERLIN, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- China played an important role in facilitating the final signing of the Paris Agreement, and will "100 percent" fulfill its promises on climate action, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said here on Friday in an interview with Reuters.

China is the largest developing country, and the process of industrialization has not yet been completed, Wang said, noting that it is necessary to speed up the development process so that the Chinese people can lead a better life.

Meanwhile, China, as a major country, is willing to shoulder its due international responsibilities and obligations, Wang said.

For a country with a population of 1.4 billion, fulfilling its promises on reducing emissions is the biggest contribution to the world and the human development, Wang said.

China has completed its annual emission reduction target per unit of GDP ahead of schedule over the past years, and it is now home to half of the world's new energy vehicles. Its installed capacity for renewable energy accounts for one third of the world's total amount, Wang said.

China joined the international community in combating climate change with solid actions, not with slogans, Wang noted.

He also said China insists on the new development concepts of innovation, coordination, green development, openness and sharing, and strives to realize sustainable and high-quality development.

China and Europe have complementary advantages on green development, and China is willing to strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation in this regard, he said.
