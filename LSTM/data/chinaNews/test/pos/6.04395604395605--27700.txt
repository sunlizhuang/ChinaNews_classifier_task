The rise of Gen.G: Benefit targets new consumer tribe with female gamer partnerships

The LVMH-owned colour cosmetics brand has teamed up with a host of gaming sensations for a new digital initiative

Benefit Cosmetics has bagged its first cross-industry collaboration with five of leading e-sports company Gen.G’s most popular female gamers.

The e-sports organisation works with top gaming teams across China, South Korea and the US, and was ranked by Forbes as the sixth most valuable e-sports company in 2019.

As part of initiative, gaming sensations Kristen Valnicek, Gina Darling, Nicki Taylor and Jayden Diaz will appear with host Eleanor Barnes to share their beauty routines and the realities of being a gamer.

Barnes will also create a custom ‘Game Face’ make-up look for each guest.

“After serving women for more than 40 years in the business, we at Benefit know how empowering make-up can be when women use it as a tool for expression, creativity and self love,” said Lisa Li, Benefit Cosmetics’ Director Global Digital Marketing.

“Women make up almost half of the audience watching and playing games.

“We are so excited to share these episodes with both the gaming and beauty communities through this work with Gen.G and these women who are leading the industry forward.”

The videos are available on Benefit’s Instagram and YouTube channels.

Valnicek added: "I'm thrilled that Gen.G and Benefit are working together to bring a sense of belonging and community within gaming for women.

“There are so many amazing women in the gaming community, and I am excited that through partnerships like this, women can take the spotlight and feel confident about their gameplay.”

Last year, online retailer Cult Beauty predicted beauty brands would look to gamers as a new tribe of influencer as part of its 2020 trend predictions.
