Chongqing has great manufacturing ability. As the Provisional Capital during the Chinese civil war, Chongqing is an old industrial city with the military industry as its main industry. It has a great deal of military enterprises headed by Chang’an, Jialing and Jianshe. These military enterprises had the greatest technical strength and the most advanced manufacturing abilities at that time, and became key national defense enterprises. It was these military enterprises which shouldered the industrial foundation of Chongqing. During the later military conversion into civilian enterprises period, the manufacturing technologies which used to be military secrets were given away, and begun to be used by civilian enterprises.

With the constant development and expansion of these enterprises, Chongqing became an important manufacturing base from an inconveniently located and resource lacking city of mountains. Three specially important conditions were formed: first is the formation of the typical Chongqing manufacturing culture, hard-working and tolerant of hardship; second, Chongqing doesn’t only master the manufacturing technologies, but also train a great batch of technical talents and skilled workers; third is the formation of the great and complete supplying chain which provides exceptionally favorable conditions for the birth and development of Chongqing’s private motorcycle makers, and distances itself from other regions in competitive advantages. Under such environment, it’s very easy to go into the motorcycle manufacturing industry. So Chongqing’s motorcycle industry was once unusually prosperous: with only one production line, and the one continuous line of production and sales system consisting of parts, workers and the market. The motorcycle manufacturing business became a fortune game of competing courage. This also contributed to the birth of many small motorcycle companies in Chongqing.

As a whole the CIMAMotor 2011 was a great experience for MOBILE WORLD, successfully organized by its kind and efficient management lead by Director, Mr. Wang Wei, and his team members. International Marketing Promotion Managers; Ms. Rebecca Shi, Ms. Apple Long, and Mr. Zhen Jie Liang (Jay) were the main pillars who dealt very well with affection to assist all members of the overseas media. In addition, the volunteers/translators provided by them like; Ms. Sunny and Ms. Soi extended remarkable assistance for visiting the exhibitors’ stalls and facilitating the professional discussions. Another distinguished feature of this event was the Magnificent Lunch hosted by Ms. Sunny at her beautiful Music Restaurant, which is unforgettable.
