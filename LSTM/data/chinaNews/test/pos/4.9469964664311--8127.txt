On Jan 12, the 15th BB Charity Carnival was held in Bukit Bintang in conjunction with the Chinese New Year celebrations. Deemed a success, the carnival saw 1,800 charity recipients receiving aid. The recipients are made up of single mothers, orphans, the elderly, former drug abusers, special needs individuals and those from the lower end of the income spectrum.

Officiated by Federal Territories Minister Khalid Abdul Samad, others that attended were members of the government and non-governmental organisations (NGO), along with religious leaders from Jabatan Agama Islam Wilayah Persekutuan (JAWI), the Ti-Ratana Buddhist Society, Malaysia Hindu Sanggam, the Archdiocese of Kuala Lumpur and the Federation Of Taoist Association Of Malaysia.

“I am grateful that many from governmental bodies, NGOs and media have supported this carnival. In 2020, we have succeeded in adding to the number of recipients, seeing an increase from 1,500 last year to 1,800. We wanted this event to help bring some joy to the less fortunate during Chinese New Year,” said KK Group Founder and Group Executive Chairman Datuk K.K. Chai.

Chai further remarked that the government’s attention to the B40 group is a good sign and strategies from other ministries should be strengthened to better focus on this particular income group. He also pointed out that both the government and NGOs should work hand-in-hand to help the aforementioned community, instead of leaving it to just the other party to handle.

In its pursuit and commitment to the aiding society in various aspects, the other projects that KK Super Mart is involved with includes a food bank project with JAWI and the Kasih Ibu Smart Selangor project with the Selangor government, among others.
