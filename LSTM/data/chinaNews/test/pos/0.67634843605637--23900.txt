Indian food is hands down one of the most wholesome cuisines out in the world. After all, it is made of the most ingredient out of all: Love.

However, experimentation with food is mostly a good idea and when Indian food comes in contact with unique Western flavours, the end result is a blessing for our taste buds.

Here are some unique Indo-Western food combinations that might sound unusual to you but taste better together.

1. Schezwan Dosa

Flavours from down South are infused with a taste of our neighbouring country. Even though this combination of two completely opposite dishes sounds bizarre to you, it makes for a wholesome meal. The chef either spreads the Schezwan sauce on the dosa's base or cook the noodles directly in it which then become the filling. A common dish nowadays, it might just leave behind the traditional dosa.





2. Nutella Parantha

If this parantha existed back in the '90s when we were growing up, none of us would have ever missed our breakfasts. An upgrade from the mixed fruit jam with parantha, this one is for the chocolate-lovers. It can easily be recognised as the Indian pancake with Nutella and since desis love their paranthas the most, it easily becomes the better version.

3. Chicken samosa

Even samosa isn't technically something that originated in India, it's more or less a solid part of the Indian cuisine. Traditionally filled with mashed potatoes and green peas, this snack is a favourite tea-time snack. To make things more exciting and 'meaty', chicken-filled samosas are available for non-vegetarians now.





4. Motichoor cheesecake

We all love laddoos and we all love cheesecakes. Combining the two desserts definitely sounds like a great idea for the sweet-tooth club. The softness of the cheese and the crunchy biscuit-base infused with motichoor is a perfect example of East meets West.

5. Chinese Bhel

Indians love their own version of Chinese food so much that they've invented brand new dishes on their own. Chinese bhel is chopsuey in disguise and the word 'bhel' makes it feel like it's ours to own. Deep-fried noodles are mixed with finely-chopped onions and other vegetables along with chilli sauce, ajinomoto and garlic paste. It is the perfect snack for people who love fiery flavours.

6. Vodka Gol Gappa

Add booze to anything and it automatically becomes a dish everyone wants to try out. Gol gappas or puchkas or pani puris or whatever they call it in your state, they are almost every Indian's favourite snack. Some like it spicy, some like it sweet but the invention of vodka gol gappas has all of us loving the combo. From mint-based vodka water to imli wali vodka, there's something in it for everyone.

7. Tofu Biryani

Since the country's favourite rice-based dish did not offer any vegan options, tofu came to the rescue. Infused with the usual biryani flavours, tofu biryani is the healthiest option there is when it comes to the Mughlai dish.

8. Kheer Sushi

No Indian festival is complete without kheer and these days, there is a cross between the Indian dessert and the Japanese dish, sushi. Also known as Kheer Japaani or Rice Kheer Sushi, this one is a sweet take on the Japanese staple.

9. Butter Chicken Doughnut

This definitely sounds like a dish that was invented by a drunk Punjabi in search of some munchies after a night of drinking. The combination might not sound too gastronomic to you but once you start eating this, your taste buds will thank whoever came up with this genius idea.

10. Makhani Pasta

Forget about the arrabiatas and alfredos, makhani pasta is what should be on every menu. Tingling our desi palette to satisfying our love for the Italian dish, this version of pasta is a God-send.

11. Manchurian Khakra

No Gujarati household is complete without some khakra and there are so many flavours out there now, it's almost hard to choose. However, this one takes the price since it adds a Chinese twist to the famous Gujju snack.
