CHINATOWN, Manhattan — Happy Year of the Rat!

New York City has one of the largest Asian American communities in the United States and we really know how to celebrate the Lunar New Year, even after a fire destroyed a beloved community center in the heart of Chinatown.

“Rain is good for Chinese people,” Margaret Chin, NYC Councilmember, told PIX11 News. “It means money and prosperity.” Chin added.

A little rain didn’t stop thousands from celebrating in Chinatown and Flushing the start of the lunar new year.

Spirits were high even though many are also mourning the loss of a vital community center, considered the heart of Chinatown at 70 Mulberry Street, which housed the Chinatown senior center and the Museum of Chinese in America.

At least 85,000 artifacts, some dating back to the 19th century, may have been destroyed in that fast-moving fire Thursday night.

“I just heard good news. I heard when the building is stable, we will be able to take archives out,” Chin added.

At a lunar new year celebration at the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, many worried about where the 400 seniors who eat lunch every week day at the Chinatown Senior Center will go come Monday morning.

For many it’s their only meal of the day.

“The Chinese-American Planning Council is working the Department of Aging and the operators of the senior center to find another place in the neighborhood,” Jenny Low, the director of the New York Council Office of Community Engagement, told PIX11 News.

A GoFund me page has been set up for the museum, which tells the story of the Chinese migration to the United States.

In less than a day, more than $32,000 has been raised, which brought the Assembly Member from this area close to tears.

“I think it’s incredible,” Yuh- Line Niou, the assemblywoman for lower Manhattan, told PIX11 News. “That’s our community speaking up for one another,” she added.
