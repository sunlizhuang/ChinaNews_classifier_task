The number of known coronavirus infections in Thailand nearly doubled today as six additional were confirmed by health officials.

Sukhum Sookpimai of the Public Health Ministry announced the six patients, which makes for 14 in the realm this month, the most outside of China since the first case abroad was detected in Bangkok earlier this month.

All six new patients were Chinese nationals, according to Sukhum. Among them was someone traveling from Chongqing while five others – aged 6 to 60 — were from Hubei province, where the city of Wuhan is located.

Five of the eight previous patients had already recovered and left the country, officials said late last week.

All the new patients are being treated at Bamrasnaradura Hospital in northwest metro Bangkok.
