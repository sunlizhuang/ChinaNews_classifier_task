TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Gerindra Party secretary-general Ahmad Muzani asserts that President Jokowi’s visit to Natuna today disproves the notion from people accusing the government of neglecting the Natuna border dispute with China.

“I might argue the visit to Natuna is to strengthen and lift people’s spirit, that the government has given major attention towards the Natuna issue,” said Muzani at the Home Affairs Ministry in Central Jakarta on Wednesday, January 8.

President Jokowi’s visit to the Riau Island in Natuna was accompanied by TNI Commander Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto, Presidential Chief of Staff Moeldoko, Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) Minister Arifin Tasrif, ATR’s Surya Chandra, and Presidential Spokesman Fadjroel Rahman.

Jokowi’s visit, said Muzani, is to assert Indonesia’s priority toward diplomacy in attempting to solve the issue with China, which Gerindra Party agrees with.

“Yes, international issues must, in the end, be resolved in a diplomatic manner. I think we must pursue persuasion in matters of politics and other things we face,” said the Gerindra member.

Previously reported, President Jokowi said the dispute in the Natuna Sea between Indonesia and China cannot be handled lightly and asserted that the Indonesian government will not back down from fighting China’s claims that overlaps the maritime border in Natuna. He maintained that Indonesia’s sovereignty is not a bargaining tool.
