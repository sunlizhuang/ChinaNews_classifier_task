CHINESE Ambassador Huang Xilian and Adm. Joel Sarsiban Garcia, commandant of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), have agreed to “enhance pragmatic cooperation” between the Philippines and China in the various Coast Guard fields.

The two met at the PCG headquarters to discuss the visit of the China Coast Guard (CCG) Vessel 5204 to the Philippines and the holding of the third Meeting of the Joint Coast Guard Committee between Manila and Beijing next week.





“The visit and meeting will be a good opportunity for both sides to demonstrate goodwill, deepen mutual understanding and trust, as well as enhance friendship and cooperation,” the Chinese envoy said.

He added that the visit and meeting would “inject new impetus into the healthy and steady development of China-Philippine relations, and contribute to the regional peace and stability.”

Admiral Garcia said the PCG “warmly” welcomed the first visit of CCG vessel to the Philippines and would like to take the opportunity of the third meeting to “deepen practical cooperation between the two parties in the fields of transnational crime, maritime search and rescue, environmental protection and emergency response.”

Ambassador Huang said the cooperation between the CCG and PCG had made “positive progress” over the past three years.

The two sides have established a hotline mechanism that has resulted in the expansion of the areas of cooperation.

Garcia said the Philippines would continue to work with China to “actively” promote “Coast Guard Diplomacy” in an effort to “enhance mutual trust and promote friendship through exchanges and cooperation.”
