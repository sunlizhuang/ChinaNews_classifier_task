Maritime Security Agency (Bakamla) chief Vice Adm. Achmad Taufiquerrochman will step down from his position in the near future after having officially entered retirement last year.

Achmad said his retirement had nothing to do with a recent skirmish involving Chinese fishers and coast guard vessels in Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the North Natuna Sea.

“I retired on Nov. 1, 2019, but was requested to stay at my post until the end of the year. Therefore, I think this is according to plan,” Achmad told The Jakarta Post on Friday.

Indonesian Military (TNI) Academy chief Vice Adm. Aan Kurnia is set to be the new Bakamla chief following Achmad’s departure.

Aan confirmed his appointment as Achmad’s successor but refused to comment on his priorities as the next chief.

Achmad said he had not received a date for the inauguration ceremony but stated he would not take on a strategic position after stepping down.

“I did not receive any position proposals. I just want to enjoy my retirement as I’ve served my country for 35 years,” he said.

Meanwhile, Bakamla secretary Rear Adm. Suprianto Irawan said the agency was currently planning on becoming a proper coast guard.

“How the design will shape up is up to the government,” he said.

He added that Bakamla needed an overhaul led by a four-star officer because the coast guard would integrate with other agencies including the customs agency, the Transportation Ministry’s Indonesian Coast and Sea Guard (KPLP) and other related agencies.

“Therefore, everyone will join forces in securing our seas, and not separately,” he said.

He also denied that there would be competition between the coast guard and the Indonesian Navy once the coast guard is led by a four-star officer that is equal to the Navy’s chief of staff.

“There won’t be any dualism. The Navy’s function is for defense and security, while the coast guard is only security so it’s different. Currently, we’ve been warned and hopefully [a Bakamla overhaul] will take place as quickly as possible,” he said. (mpr)
