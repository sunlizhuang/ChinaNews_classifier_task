A few weeks ago, two of Deep Ellum’s biggest players — Westdale Real Estate and StreetLights Residential — let the word out that they have another new project in the works.

Now details of the high-rise development called Canton Street Lofts have been filed with the Dallas Landmark Commission.

Westdale and StreetLights plan to build two new apartment buildings next door to the landmark Adam Hats building on Canton Street.

A four-story building would stretch along Canton at Crowdus Street. Behind that, the plan is to build a 17-story apartment tower next to the elevated highway behind the Adam Hats Building.

The Canton Street building is next door to the Adam Hats Building, which opened in 1914 and has been converted to apartments.

“It will be primarily clad in brick masonry with cast stone detailing, and partially clad with metal panels,” according to the Landmark Commission filing. “The overall design is intended to be a contemporary interpretation of the Adam Hats building design.

“A rooftop sign, inspired by the billboards on the historic structure, is also proposed,” according to the report. “The area between the Adam Hats building and this new construction is intended to be a courtyard for the tenants of the buildings.”

The more than century-old Adam Hats Building started out as a manufacturing plant for the Ford Motor Co.

One of Westdale’s first projects in Deep Ellum was to redevelop the former commercial building into 90 loft-style rental units.

The Canton Street Lofts would be the third joint project by Westdale and StreetLights Residential in Deep Ellum.

The two real estate firms built the 17-story Case Building apartments at Main and Hall streets near Baylor Medical Center.

And StreetLights teamed up with Westdale on the 8-acre Epic development at Elm Street and Good-Latimer Expressway. StreetLights is building a 26-story, 310-unit apartment tower called the Hamilton as part of the Epic project.
