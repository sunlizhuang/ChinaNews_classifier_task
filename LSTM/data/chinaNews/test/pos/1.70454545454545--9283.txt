On December 10, Redmi held the Redmi K30 series new product launch conference in Beijing. At this event, the company unveiled the Redmi K30 4G and 5G versions. However, the more powerful Redmi K30 Pro did not debut. Fortunately, the company said that the device will arrive in March this year. Now, there is current information that gives us a clue on what to expect from the Redmi K30 Pro.

Redmi K30 Pro – What We Know

The Redmi K30 Pro model will be basically the same as the Redmi K30 5G in terms of appearance and design. There will not be many changes and it may still use the dual-punch hole OLED display panel. The vertically-aligned quad-camera system on the rear of the K30 should also transfer over to the K30 Pro, including the circular mirror design surrounding it. This smartphone will come with a full-screen design, refresh rate up to 120Hz, and the resolution is FHD+.

As for other aspects, according to the previous information, this phone will arrive in March this year. The configuration includes the top-level Snapdragon 865 flagship chip with X55 baseband. With this configuration, it supports dual-mode 5G networks. In addition, Lu Weibing, the president of Xiaomi Group China and the general manager of the Redmi brand, spoke at the MediaTek 1000L chip launch. According to some media speculation, the K30 Pro may also be equipped with this MediaTek 1000L chip. There is no verification for this report.

One of the expectations for the Redmi K30 Pro is that it will come with a low price tag. However, this need means that this device cant get certain features. For instance, if it will use an OLED panel, we do not expect this device to also have a 120Hz display refresh rate. However, it’s totally possible the K30 Pro will join the OnePlus 8 in offering an OLED panel with a 120Hz display refresh rate.
