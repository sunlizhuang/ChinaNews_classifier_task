Following last year’s nationwide Chinese talent search in partnership with Wacom, Marvel has revealed its first Chinese New Year variant covers for 2020. Artist Jie Yuan will have three connecting variants across three Spider-Man titles, available February 12 at your local comic shop.

Yuan’s covers will feature on Symbiote Spider-Man: Alien Reality #3 (DEC190862), The Amazing Spider-Man #39 (DEC190865), and Gwen Stacy #1 (DEC190846). Characters from throughout the Spider-Verse are featured, including Peter Parker, Miles Morales, Jessica Drew, and Gwen Stacy, and Cindy Moon.

Final order cut-off for the Jie Yuan Chinese New Year connecting variants is Monday, January 20, so if you want to collect these covers, be sure to pre-order from your local shop ASAP. Marvel will reveal more covers from their talent search with Wacom in the coming weeks, so stay tuned for more collectible variants.
