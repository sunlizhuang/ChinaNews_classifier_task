The Kayoola electric buses are now on sale and will soon hit Ugandan roads, Kiira Motors Corporation (KMC) has revealed.

The buses were designed by Ugandan engineers from KMC after the government of Uganda signed a memorandum of understanding with a Chinese automobile company.

Without detailing the prices, the company’s Business Development Manager, Mr Allan Mr Muhumuza said they have already started taking orders from interested parties.

“Prices are determined on a case by case basis because buses are unique to the need of the buyer. Some may want a luxury bus with a toilet, executive seats, blinds, mood lights, while another will just want plastic seats, maximum capacity, etc. all I can say is the price will be competitive on the market,” Mr Muhumza said.

He was speaking at the fellowship of the Rotaract Club of Kampala South at Hotel Africana yesterday, where Kiira Motors Corporation was awarded for its innovativeness and value addition to the transport sector.

Mr Muhumza noted that the company is currently targeting the public transport sector, tourism, education, health, government agencies, and companies, among other consumers.

“Along the way we shall diversify our portfolio beyond buses to also have trucks, for haulage for instance in mining and construction. We will also have SUVs and utility vehicles,” he said.

Considering that electric vehicles are a new innovation in Uganda, Muhumza revealed that KMC is working out a plan to certify service centres across the country, such that consumers are covered in case of emergencies.
