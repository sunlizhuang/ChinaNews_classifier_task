Chinese New Year was still a week away when the Goh clan gathered at the family home in Banting, Selangor, last weekend.

They had all assembled for their yearly ritual of making kuih bahulu, a spongy egg cake which is one of the most popular treats during the festivities.

Housewife Goh Boon Huey, 61, was in charge of the hustle and bustle in her compound. She had been busy with preparations for the festive season. Her house had been springcleaned, and festive ornaments had been hung up to usher in the Year of the Rat.

To add to the festivities, she had gathered her family for their annual ritual of making kuih bahulu.

Joining the mother-of-three to help in the labour-intensive task were her sisters, Jenny Goh Huat Eng and Goh Luang Eng, and a host of relatives.

She was most happy to have her niece Mahiro Goh, 43, who took time off from work in Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, to celebrate the Lunar New Year with the family.

The sexagenarian views it as a time of bonding and fun among family.

“This time around, we have an international team to help to make the kuih bahulu. My niece, who works in Singapore, is also back to lend a helping hand. Everyone looks forward to coming together to make these traditional treats. Half the time is spent catching up, cracking jokes and munching on the fresh kuih bahulu along the way, ” she quipped.

It’s like a Chinese New Year gathering among Goh and her family. The house was bustling with activity as everyone gathered around to help lighten the load to make kuih bahulu.

Homemade popiah is specially prepared for the kuih bahulu makers.

To add to the festive spirit, Goh and her sisters prepared an array of mouth-watering delights for the family. There were several plates of homemade pork lorbak (deep fried pork rolls), smoked pork and chicken, popiah and nian gao (sweet and sticky rice cake).

“My late mother used to prepare these items each year during Chinese New Year. Although it is time-consuming to make these items from scratch, we continue to do it as it is part of our heritage.”

It is a laborious task to make kuih bahulu but Goh is happy her children and nieces are continuing the tradition.

“Although it is convenient to purchase off-the-shelf cookies, homemade goodies are always fresher and tastier. I am happy the younger generation is willing to learn and preserve this tradition, ” said Goh, who has been making kuih bahulu for over 50 years.

Goh hopes her young nieces and grandchildren will learn the art of making kuih bahulu, the traditional way.

Her niece, marketing executive Goh Su Ming, 25, is well aware of the effort involved in preparing these treats. Though it may be a lot of hard work, she doesn’t mind going the extra mile to preserve her grandmother’s recipes.

“It adds to a lively atmosphere nearing Chinese New Year. While I can buy these cookies online, they will never taste as good as the ones prepared by my family. There’s a lot of love and joy that goes into these family treats, ” said Su Ming.

Su Ming’s cousin Ginny Goh Hui Chen, has been organising the kuih bahulu-making sessions at their family home in Banting, Selangor, since 2000.

“This is my late grandmother’s recipe which has been passed down for generations. The recipe is about 80 years old. We have been doing it for years in remembrance of my grandmother, who passed away in 2006, ” said Ginny who runs a retail business in Kuala Lumpur.

Everyone gathered at Goh’s home at 9am. They aimed to prepare at least 40 jars of the mouth-watering morsels by 3pm.

“It’s a lot of hard work. The toughest part is sitting beside the hot charcoal stove. It gets very hot in the afternoon so we try to complete making as many kuih bahulu as possible by early afternoon, ” said Goh.

Kuih bahulu is one of the must haves during Chinese New Year.

Goh prepared the four charcoal stoves first thing in the morning. The temperature had to be just right to ensure the kuih bahulu doesn’t burn.

“If it isn’t hot enough, the kuih bahulu will take too long to cook. Sometimes, it won’t be spongy.”

At a corner, there were stacks of egg trays, several kgs of sugar, tins of margarine and wheat flour, ingredients needed to make the kuih bahulu.

Goh was in charge of mixing the batter in a large aluminium pail. It was a tedious process as Goh insisted on mixing the ingredients using a spurtle. For the batter, she mixed 40 eggs, 1kg margarine and sugar, and close to 1kg of flour.

The kuih bahulu batter is mixed by hand, using a wooden spurtle.

Her nieces and nephews, who were roped in to mix the batter, complained that it was tough work.

Ginny lamented, while wiping her forehead: “Making kuih bahulu is a challenging process. It takes such a long time to beat the batter to the right consistency. My hands are aching from the continuous mixing.”

Goh patiently reminded her niece that the sweet treats taste nicer when they are handmade.

“Stirring helps to add more air into the batter and increases the fluffiness. This is how your grandmother did it and we follow her method. It’s a lot of hard work and that’s why it tastes so nice, ” she told her nieces.

Once the batter was mixed to the right consistency, Ginny and her cousins spooned the batter into the hot moulds, which were then covered with a brass lid covered with hot charcoal, which helped speed up the cooking process.

“The bahulu has to be checked from time to time. It can burn quickly so one has to keep an eye on the hot molds, ” said Ginny, who has helped her grandmother prepare kuih bahulu since she was a little girl.

It takes skill to control the fire and to ensure the kuih bahulu isn't overcooked.

From time to time, Ginny and her helpers opened the moulds to check if the sponge cakes were ready. Once cooked to perfection, they were pried off the moulds with satay sticks. The delicious morsels were then cooled on wire racks.

They then greased the moulds and returned them to the stove to heat up for the next round of baking.

The younger ones were tasked with arranging the kuih bahulu in tins lined with parchment paper.

“This time, the load was lighter as 20 family members chipped in to help. Kuih bahulu is easy to eat but preparing them over a charcoal stove is tedious work, ” explained Ginny, who also helped her aunts prepare peanut cookies and pineapple tarts for the festive season.

After four hours, they accomplished their goal of making 40 containers of kuih bahulu. The sweet treats were divided among seven families. Some would be given away to neighbours and close relatives.

Su Ming was exhausted after the family cook-out. While it was been a long and tiring day, she enjoyed every moment of it and is already looking forward to next year’s kuih bahulu session.

“Next year, I want to learn to make Ah Po’s soft and fluffy popiah skin and the filling for spring rolls, which has ingredients like long beans, prawn fritters, omelette and cucumber.

“Hopefully, I can also help Aunty Boon Huey mix the batter and set the charcoal fire to the right temperature. These are part of my family traditions and I hope to preserve it for many more generations, ” said Su Ming.
