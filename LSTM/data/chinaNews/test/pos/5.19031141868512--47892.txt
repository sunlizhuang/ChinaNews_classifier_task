Sri Lanka Monday appealed to treat visiting Chinese nationals with respect, particularly in view of its contribution to end the three decade old conflict and its aid provided.

“We should show gratitude to the Chinese at times when they are facing difficult times due to the Coronavirus situation”, Health Minister Pavithra Wanniaarachchi told a news conference.

Her comments came after few incidents where Chinese nationals have not been entertained as some of the restaurants.

Ms Wanniaarachchi said that the people should remember that China is one of the countries that backed Sri Lanka at international forums when the government was fighting the war against the LTTE.

Chinese Ambassador in Sri Lanka Cheng Xueyuan while appreciating Sri Lanka’s support during the Coronavirus crisis said it was worrying that some taxis, hotels and restaurants are refusing Chinese citizens.

“ I believe the true friendship can and must stand the test of difficulties. We understand the concerns of Sri Lanka public but we at the same time hope that they could feel China’s responsible attitude and see the forceful and effective measures taken by China,” the Ambassador said in a statement.

“The epidemic shall be defeated in the end, and at that day when we look back, we hope what we could remember is the strong look in the supportive faces and the warmth in the encouraging hands, just as what Chinese people have done when Sri Lanka went through difficulties,”he said.

“ Again, my sincere thanks and best wishes to all Sri Lanka friends of Chinese government, embassy and Chinese people for your encouragement and support. We will never forget your kindness”, he added.
