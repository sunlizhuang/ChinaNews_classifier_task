The Welfare Officer of the Ghana Union of Traders Association (GUTA), Benjamin Yeboah, ahead of the State of the Nation Address (SONA) has stated that he expects the President to speak to the issue of importation from China especially with the outbreak of the Coronavirus disease in China.

According to him, the current outbreak in China has affected Ghanaian traders who import goods from China to Ghana.

In an interview on the Happy Morning Show aired on Happy 98.9FM, he said: “Most of our members import their goods from China. Now that there is Coronavirus, a lot of our members are unable to go to China. So we are looking up to the president to see if he can help us in any way, whether through financing or collaborations with other foreign ministries because now our members have to go to other parts of Europe for goods”.

In his opinion, another alternative the Government can tap into is the building of more factories under the One District, One Factory project .This, he says will reduce the number of traders who import goods outside the country.

The President will address the nation later today as he delivers the final State of the Nation Address (SONA) for his first term. GUTA has stated that it expects the President to speak on import duties or clearance of duties at the port, Nigeria’s closed border, the cost of borrowing from banks, besides importation to China amidst Coronavirus.

Join the trio, Samuel Eshun, Fati Shaibu-Ali and Raymond Nyamador on Happy Morning Show every weekday (Monday to Friday) 5:30am to 9:00am.
