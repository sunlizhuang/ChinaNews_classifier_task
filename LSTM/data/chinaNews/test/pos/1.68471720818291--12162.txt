3 – ​Same, but different: AOBiome aims to capture China market with Mother Dirt 'twin'

US-based microbiome company AOBiome is poised to tackle the Chinese market with AO+ Skincare, a new brand based​ on its own probiotic beauty brand, Mother Dirt.

Like Mother Dirt, AO+ Skincare products contain the hero ingredient, Ammonia Oxidizing Bacteria (AOB). AOBiome claims that AOB acts as the “peacekeeper” of skin microbiome health but gets wiped out with the daily use of personal care products like soaps and deodorants.

The AO+ Skincare brand was created for China and Hong Kong markets, where it launched around six months ago. It is currently distributing its products through its own online store and via e-commerce platform JD.com

The brand not only has a different name but an entirely different look.

Shanshan Liu, head of marketing for AOBiome Cosmetics, explained to CosmeticsDesign-Asia​ that the company had to change the name because Mother Dirt does not translate well into Mandarin and would not resonate well with Chinese consumers.

“China is very new for us, but we see a lot of potential. Many of our products are already in the Chinese market through the big international companies but we want to work directly with Chinese brands because we see a lot of potential there,” ​said Felipe Rodríguez Caneiro, Asia Pacific area manager, Virospack.

More specifically, the firm sees plenty of opportunity in the premium beauty space, added Joanna Milne, account manager, Virospack.

“We know that prices of European-made products are much higher but today Chinese companies are willing to pay for the service and the high quality. We do see many such companies are willing to pay a premium to have their product made in Europe. There’s a market here for it definitely.”​

5 – ​Colour craze: Intercos aims to strengthen position in China on the back of make-up boom

A spike in demand for colour cosmetics has created an opportunity for the Intercos Group to accelerate its business and further strengthen its position​ in the Chinese market.

In the past few years, the Italian cosmetics maker has observed a shift in market demand from skin care into colour cosmetics in China.

For the past two years, lipsticks have been the top make-up product. However, its appetite for colour is driving the popularity of eyeshadow palettes.
