Second batch of humanitarian aid

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said in a statement that the supplies were sent via Singapore Airlines flight SQ802.

On Wednesday (Feb. 19), Singapore’a Ambassador to China, Lui Tuck Yew, handed over the humanitarian assistance to People’s Liberation Army General Hospital Medical Service Department Deputy Head, SCOL Zhang Fu, in Beijing.

MFA added:

“The humanitarian assistance will help communities severely affected by the outbreak in China, and contribute to efforts to contain the virus.”

This follows an earlier dispatch of humanitarian assistance by the Singapore Government to Wuhan on Scoot Flight TR5120 on Feb. 8.

A collective effort by Singaporeans

On Feb. 7, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat explained to the Vice Premier of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China Han Zheng that the humanitarian assistance from the Singapore Government was part of a collective effort by Singaporeans to help the affected communities in China.

The assistance included fund-raising efforts by the Singapore Red Cross, with support from trade associations and chambers, companies, as well as local community organisations.

Singapore’s Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) also contributed over 2,000kg of medical supplies such as safety goggles, N95 masks and medical hand wash.

DPM Heng reaffirmed to Han Singapore’s confidence that China, Singapore and the rest of the international community will overcome the Covid-19 crisis through close cooperation.
