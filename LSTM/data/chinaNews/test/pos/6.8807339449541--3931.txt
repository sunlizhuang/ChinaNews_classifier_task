To help everyone start 2020 on a positive note, Eu Yan Sang has introduced new Chinese New Year hampers and a PSA video titled ‘Home Is Where The Love Is,’ to remind those celebrating to return home for reunion dinner because, as Eu Yan Sang director Eric Chiu puts it: “Our roots are wherever our home is.”

According to him, gifting has long been a part of Chinese culture, and the act of giving out hampers as gifts signifies the act of wishing good health and longevity. Eu Yan Sang’s hampers are filled with healthy products that are suitable for all ages, making them an excellent choice for the family.

Moving into a new decade, Eu Yan Sang, through its annual ‘Bucket of Gold’ community charity event, is continuing to inspire everyone – especially young adults – to work hard and achieve success in life. The charity event also champions the spirit of giving back to society and caring for those in need.

The beneficiary of this year’s ‘Bucket of Gold’ is the Lovely Disabled Home, a charity organisation which provides a barrier-free work environment for Malaysians aged above 18 with physical disabilities, intellectual disabilities and cerebral palsy. The home provides the support structure to empower its wards to join society and become self-sufficient.
