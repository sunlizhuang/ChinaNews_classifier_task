The Chinese American Association of Lexington (CAAL) is working with multiple Chinese American associations in Massachusetts including Weston, Winchester and Sharon to fund-raise for the people of Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus virus is having a significant social and economic impact.

The city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas in the Hubei province are being ravaged by the outbreak. Multiple cities in the province are locked down with no public transportation in and out of the city. Hospital are overcrowded; medical staff overwhelmed; protective gears for medical and preventive usage in dire supply.

The goal is to use the funds to purchase supplies including face masks, protective goggles, medical gloves and protective clothes and ship them to hospitals in Wuhan as soon as possible. Teams specialized in logistics and local volunteers have been mobilized to guarantee delivery of these goods.

The fundraising and the goods delivery process will be completely transparent. All of your donations will be used to benefit hospitals and residents in Wuhan.

Here is how to donate:

1. PayPal to CAAL using “Sending to friends and family” at donation@caal-ma.org or http://bit.ly/CAAL4WuHan and note “Wuhan”.

2. Mail your check to: Chinese American Association of Lexington, Inc. (CAAL), PO Box 453, Lexington, MA 02420. Add “Wuhan” on the memo line.

CAAL is an IRS recognized Sec. 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. CAAL’s EIN: 46-2998909. You can also apply for company matching if your company provides the charity matching benefits.
