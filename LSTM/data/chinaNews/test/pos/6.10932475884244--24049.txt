IPOH: In the quiet neighbourhood of Taman Ipoh Jaya here, Aminah Chan Abdullah, 71, always has her hands full when she prepares to usher in the Chinese New Year.

A former hairstylist, Aminah, a mother of two and doting grandmother to two young girls, looks forward to the celebration because she loves the fact that she can meet and catch up with family and friends.

“I embraced Islam close to 50 years ago when I married my husband, Sardar Ali, in Kampar, Perak, where both of us are from. I am blessed and thankful as he never stopped me from celebrating Chinese New Year. In fact, when he was still alive, he, too, looked forward to it as it was a time where we not only celebrated the festivities, but also got together with family and friends, who we otherwise did not see often because of work and family commitments.

“My late husband was a kind-hearted and loving man who was a true Malaysian, as apart from Hari Raya and Chinese New Year, we would also celebrate festivals like Christmas and Deepavali because we have relatives and friends of different beliefs and cultures.

“It is only natural for us to celebrate with them as it brings us closer together. These festive periods are the ideal reason to take time off from our busy schedules, which more often than not keep us apart,” said Aminah.

Where Chinese New Year is concerned, Aminah not only plays host to relatives from her side of the family, but also those from her late husband’s as well, along with neighbours and friends.

“Our immediate family is of Malay and Chinese descent, and it is ‘rojak’ where our extended family and relatives are concerned, as quite a few have married those of other races and backgrounds. This comes as no surprise, looking at the richness and diversity of Malaysian society,” Aminah pointed out.

During Chinese New Year, Aminah will usually be busy in the kitchen preparing all sorts of delicacies and delicious dishes, many of which she learnt from her late mother.

“I will prepare dishes which I serve only during this period. And being a Muslim, the food is halal and it should be to their delight as each year they (relatives and friends) keep coming back for more,” she quipped.

“So during this festive period, I will prepare and serve food such as salted and steamed chicken, lotus root soup, which many believe can bring good fortune, salted cucumber, stir-fried sengkuang, a special salad and more.

“But really, food aside, I do not mind the hard work to prepare for Chinese New Year. It is a special occasion that I look forward to as I am able to provide a good reason and venue for family and friends to congregate. Over a meal and snacks, we can mingle freely and spend quality time with one another, and this is what’s so precious,” she added.

Aminah’s eldest daughter, Rosie Sa, 43, an entrepreneur, who is also an immediate past president of the Kiwanis Club of Kuala Lumpur, echoed her sentiments.

“I am truly blessed. If not for her hard work, we would not be able to catch up with one another because most of us are busy with our own lives,” she said.

“My younger brother and I had a good upbringing. Our parents always taught us that coming together during Chinese New Year, Hari Raya and other festive periods is a must as they are a special time for bonding as well as reconnecting with one another.

“And most importantly, they instilled in us that we must appreciate everything and respect everyone’s culture and beliefs regardless of who they are.”
