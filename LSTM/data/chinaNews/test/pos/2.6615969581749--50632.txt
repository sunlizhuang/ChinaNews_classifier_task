Deputies with the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff’s Station recently helped reunite an international traveler with his lost wallet containing more than $1,000 at Six Flags Magic Mountain.

On Tuesday, Jan. 28, a man visiting Six Flags Magic Mountain from Beijing, China reportedly lost his wallet in the park, containing all of his credit cards and over $1,000 cash, according to Shirley Miller in an official post from the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff’s Station.

“(He) was scheduled to go back to China the next morning with his son, and was very concerned as he had no means to buy fuel or food,” Miller wrote.

The man proceeded to go to the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff’s Station’s sub-station located outside the park’s main entrance to explain his circumstances.

“Deputy Clark and Deputy Elliott listened carefully to the man, noting the areas where the wallet could have possibly been lost,” Miller wrote. “Engaging the assistance of a security officer in the park, the deputies went and checked different locations, making contact with various employees.”

Their efforts eventually paid off, as they located the man’s wallet on the ground near a fence underneath one of the large roller coasters.

“After the man was reunited with the wallet, he could not express his appreciation enough,” Miller wrote. “In a letter sent to the station, he stated, ‘I am proud of your excellent team and service that makes tourists from around world be fully confident and feel safe and comfortable in the USA.'”
