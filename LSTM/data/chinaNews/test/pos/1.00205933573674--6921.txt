In celebration of Lunar New Year, Starbucks Japan is launching a special line of drinkware that’s designed around different mythical symbols of good fortune and prosperity, as well as paying homage to the Year of the Rat.

Taking the helm is an ivory-shaded coffee tumbler featuring two maneki neko, or beckoning cats, which symbolize prosperity, as well as a little painting of Mount Fuji. According to Japanese tradition, seeing Mount Fuji in your first dream of the new year means good fortune. Then comes two mugs shaped in the form of Mount Fuji itself and the other featuring a cartoonish mouse, signifying the Year of the Rat, with the mug painted in red for good luck. Aside from these motifs, Starbucks has also tapped daruma, a traditional doll that would grant wishes. You can find him in the collection in the form of a Starbucks-green mug itself, or gracing the artwork on a tumbler and thermos flask. Finally, aside from drinkware, the coffee company has also created lifestyle items with various cartoon characters on them, such as a little pouch with maneki neko and a cute shiba-inu, or the Starbucks teddybear dressed in the form of a daruma.

For those interested in Starbucks Japan‘s latest Lunar New Year collection, you can either pick them up at local stores in the country, or online over at the Starbucks Japan website. Prices range from $13 USD for the mouse mug to $40 USD for the thermos flask.

For more Chinese New Year-related releases, Louis Vuitton has created special Chinese zodiac dials for its Tambour Horizon Monogram Eclipse.
