Canton, Holbrook, Randolph and Stoughton will get additional funds for streets as the state is increasing its funding for construction and transportation improvement projects by an additional $20 million, bringing this year's total to $220 million distributed to communities across the state.

Canton will get an additional $76,636, Holbrook $25,500, Randolph $70,050 and Stoughton $77,523 in so-called "Chapter 90" funding, managed by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation that reimburses cities and towns for approved capital improvement projects such as highway construction, preservation and roadway improvements. The state already allocated $200 million this fiscal year, but on Monday announced an additional $20 million which includes extra money for a dozen South Shore cities and towns.

The money was included in a supplemental budget signed by Gov. Charlie Baker in December.

“Municipal officials count on Chapter 90 funding each year for essential projects, and we appreciate the Legislature adopting our proposal for additional funding in the supplemental budget,” Lt. Governor Karyn Polito said in a statement. “This support will allow community leaders to take action immediately so that projects are ‘shovel ready’ for the spring construction season.”
