MUAR: For its annual Chinese New Year celebrations, SJKC Chung Hwa here usually invites students and teachers from neighbouring SK Jorak to join in the festivities. It was no different this year.

SK Jorak also took part in performances, with students showcasing their skills in Malay dance, adding colour to the celebrations.

This practice has been going on for as long as the two schools can remember, with everyone coming together in a show of racial integration and unity during the festive period.

Also present was the Deputy Auditor of the SJKC Chung Hwa school board, Tan Chen Sin, who presented angpows to students and guests.

With the theme "The Joy of Fostering Unity" in celebrating Chinese New Year 2020, SJKC Chung Hwa aims to promote camaraderie among students of various races in the community.
