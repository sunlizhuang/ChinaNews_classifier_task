GOMEL, 9 January (BelTA) â€“ In 2020, Gomel Oblast's trade unions are planning to sign a cooperation agreement with the Shanghai Municipality on the Trade Union, BelTA has learned from the press service of the Gomel regional association of trade unions.

A delegation of the Gomel regional association of trade unions will visit Shanghai, China, in February-March to sign the cooperation agreement.

The preliminary talks took place in July 2019 when a delegation of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions visited Gomel.

An online conference with representatives of the Bryansk Oblast trade union federation will take place in March to discuss the relevant matters of labor law and social benefits for workers.

The mission of the Gomel regional association of trade unions is to protect legitimate rights and interests of local workers. The organization also expands international ties.
