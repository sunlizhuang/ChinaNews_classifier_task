SUNY Canton receives military-friendly honor from G.I. Jobs Magazine

SUNY Canton is continuing its tradition of being among an elite group of schools that have earned a military-friendly endorsement from G.I. Jobs magazine.

The organization announced Feb. 11, 2020, the college has earned the designation for the ninth consecutive year, primarily due to its outstanding support services. Military and Veterans Student Services Director Patrick S. Massaro helps service members and their families connect with the resources available to help them achieve their academic goals.

“We also have a staff member who assists prospective students translate their military service into college credits based on American Council on Education guidelines,” Massaro said. “Others oversee the SUNY Canton Veterans Association, which provides a quality experience and supportive academic community.”

The Raymond G. Modell Veterans Lounge and Battle Buddy Center offers a space on campus where veterans and active duty members can socialize and build camaraderie. Modell, a 1962 graduate of the college and East Syracuse native, enrolled through the GI Bill after his Air Force service.

The college also became the first four-year SUNY institution to implement an application fee waiver policy for all active-duty, National Guard, reserve and veteran students. In addition, the SUNY Canton Career Ready Education and Success Training Center has partnered with Fort Drum to assist service members who are transitioning out of the military develop the skills needed to work in the solar energy industry. The program, called “Solar Ready Vets,” launched in 2016 and has trained more than 100 soldiers.

The college has earned endorsements from several other armed forces trade publications. This past fall, Military Times magazine identified SUNY Canton as a top school for veterans, service members and military families in its 2020 “Best for Vets” issue. Military Advanced Education & Transition magazine has also selected the college to be included in their annual education guide.

The 2020-21 G.I. Jobs list results will be published in the magazine’s May edition. The rankings can also be found online at militaryfriendly.com.
