Everyone should experience Venice, the romantic ‘City of Water’, at least once during their lifetime, and on this exclusive new cruise you’ll get to see it with TV cookery star Prue Leith.

You’ll have plenty of time to discover the Unesco World Heritage site – where gondolas replace cars and the canals are lined by elegant Renaissance palaces – on included excursions, and also visit the beautiful surrounding islands of Burano, Mazzorbo and Torcello.

You’ll go to the Rialto food market with Prue and enjoy a cooking demonstration, exclusive talk and gala dinner with her aboard this seven-night luxury Uniworld cruise.

SPECIAL GUEST You will be joined by Prue Leith Over an extraordinarily varied and successful 50-year career, Prue Leith, right, has worked as a Michelin-starred restaurateur, businesswoman, caterer, broadcaster, journalist, cookery writer and novelist. Having been a judge on the BBC’s The Great British Menu, Prue now brings her culinary experience to bear as a judge on The Great British Bake Off.
