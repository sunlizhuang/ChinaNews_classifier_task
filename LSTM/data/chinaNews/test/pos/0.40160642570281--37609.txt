A flight carrying British nationals from Wuhan airport in China to the UK will leave Wuhan at 5am local time on Friday.

It is expected to arrive back in the UK early on Friday morning, probably at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire before the passengers are taken to an NHS facility in the north-west for a quarantine period.

In a statement, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: "We are pleased to have confirmation from the Chinese authorities that the evacuation flight from Wuhan airport to the UK can depart at 5am local time on Friday 31 January.

"The safety and security of British nationals is our top priority. Our embassy in Beijing and consular teams remain in close contact with British nationals in the region to ensure they have the latest information they need."

A planned evacuation flight of UK nationals that was due to leave coronavirus-hit city of Wuhan was grounded on Thursday morning by the Chinese authorities because of a bureaucratic wrangle.

The plane was prevented from leaving China because "we haven't got the necessary clearances and we are working with the Chinese authorities on securing those", a UK Government spokesman said.

The Government anticipates flying out around 200 UK citizens who have been in Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province.
