India to invite Imran for SCO meeting in New Delhi

NEW DELHI: India is reportedly poised to invite Pakistani PM Imran Khan to an annual Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit – hosted in New Delhi this year – where the bloc’s leaders will sit down for a rare face-to-face encounter.

The SCO, the world’s largest multinational defence alliance, will convene for its yearly Heads of Government meeting in the Indian capital later this year, the first such gathering hosted by India, a relative newcomer to the organisation. Despite ongoing tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, however, New Delhi looks forward to welcoming Khan, and the ball is apparently now in Islamabad’s court, at least according to Indian officials cited by the Hindustan Times.

“According to protocol and convention, an invitation will be extended to the Pakistani Prime Minister,” an official familiar with the invitation procedure told the outlet.

After receiving observer status in 2005, both India and Pakistan joined the Shanghai Pact as full members in the summer of 2017, at a summit held in Astana. The SCO itself has its origins in a 2001 meeting in Shanghai, where the presidents of Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan codified the organisation.
