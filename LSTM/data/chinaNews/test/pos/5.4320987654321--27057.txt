GEORGE TOWN:Being a Muslim does not stop independent preacher Ben Ooi Chooi Beng, 38, from celebrating Chinese New Year with his family as joyously as he did before he embraced Islam three years ago.

Ben, as he is fondly known, and his Indonesian wife, Ema Ariani, 43, had never missed celebrating Chinese New Year with his family as it is a cultural celebration and not a religious one.

‘Although I am now a Muslim, I’m still Chinese.My relationship with my family has never been stronger.

‘I became a Muslim, not a Malay. During Chinese New Year, I would head over to my brother’s house in Bayan Lepas to celebrate with our other family members, including our parents,’he said at his brother’s house near here.

Ben said his father, Ooi Keat How, 76, and mother, Loh Nget Sun, 73, who are staying with him in Bukit Mertajam, were scheduled to attend the Chinese New Year Eve reunion dinner at his brother’s home and that they would later visit their relatives and friends.

The father of three said his parents never stopped him from converting, but encouraged him instead to become a better Muslim.

‘In addition to Chinese New Year, my family members, who are all Christians, celebrate Christmas but they know my limits as a Muslim, especially regarding halal food.

‘My brother would cook for all family members and buy only halal food for me and my family.

‘We would enjoy the meals together.

‘We hardly see each other due to work commitments, so the Chinese New Year celebration provides an opportunity for us get together with the family,’ said the youngest of three siblings.

Ben said he was happy and thankful to his family for accepting him. In fact his brother, Chooi Leong, 44, and sister, Kim Suan, 47, had provided him and his family a prayer room at their homes.

During Hari Raya Aidilfitri, Ben’s family would gather at his home to celebrate it together.

Ben has two sons, Gabriel Ooi Wei Sheng, 15, and Joshua Ooi Shan, 11, as well as 8-year-old daughter Angelina Ooi Wei Ting.

Meanwhile, patriach Ooi said when Ben told him his intention to convert to Islam, he just advised him to become a good Muslim and to obey Islamic rules.

‘We respect his decision and our relationship will never change or be broken.

‘As the saying goes, ‘blood is thicker than water’,’he said.
