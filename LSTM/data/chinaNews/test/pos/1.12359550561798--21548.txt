The Sue Lloyd-Roberts lecture series was established in honour of our alumna, an award-winning broadcast journalist whose uncompromising and courageous documentaries highlighted humanitarian issues across the world. Our Guest Speaker for the 2020 lecture is journalist and broadcaster, Carrie Gracie. Carrie was the BBC’s Beijing reporter in the early 1990s and served as China correspondent and Beijing bureau chief until 1999 when she returned to the UK to focus on presenting. For several years she anchored the morning slot on the BBC News Channel and hosted the weekly BBC World Service programme, ‘The Interview’. She continued to make documentaries about China for BBC TV and radio, winning prizes including a Peabody and an Emmy. From 2014, Carrie served as the BBC’s first China Editor, but she resigned the post in early 2018 in protest at unequal pay and has since returned to London as a news presenter while continuing to campaign for an equal, fair and transparent pay structure at the BBC.
