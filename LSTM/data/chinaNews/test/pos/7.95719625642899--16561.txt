PHNOM PENH, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- A troupe of artists from northwest China's Gansu province performed traditional Chinese dance, music, and martial arts here Tuesday evening to celebrate the Chinese New Year, which falls on Jan. 25.

Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister Hor Namhong, Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Wang Wentian, and Cambodian Princess Norodom Arun Rasmey were among about 2,000 spectators watching the show, which was held at the Diamond Island Grand Theatre.

Speaking in his speech during the opening ceremony of the cultural performance, Namhong said the Year of the Rat is believed to be the year of luck, love and fortune.

"On behalf of the Cambodian government, I wish China further development in all fields in the New Year," he said. "China's peaceful development has importantly contributed to safeguarding global peace and driving global economic growth."

The deputy prime minister was confident that cooperation between China and countries around the world will be closer in the new year, particularly under the framework of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

Ambassador Wang said the cultural performance was a good opportunity for Cambodian audience to better understand about Chinese culture and civilization.

"The performance will feature the richness of culture and traditions in China's Gansu province," he said at the opening ceremony. "I hope that this show will not only let you experience wonderful cultural performances, but also let you better know about the Chinese Spring Festival."

The two-and-a-half-hour show presented diverse artistic forms and each of the performances had drawn hearty rounds of applause from the audience.

"This is the first time that I watched such a vivid and amazing cultural performance. All artists are very talented," a 19-year-old spectator Sath Keonisa told Xinhua.

"I think such a show will contribute to strengthening cultural ties and promoting people-to-people bonds between the two countries," she said.

Another viewer Lim Nob, 21, said he longed to see more of such cultural performances.

"It was the best-ever performance I had seen. Such a performance gave an opportunity to Cambodian people to better understand the richness of Chinese culture," he said. Enditem
