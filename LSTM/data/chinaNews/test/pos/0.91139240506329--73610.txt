In this series, we take a look at the programmes and policies of the government aimed at reaching out to the last mile of development and welfare of all. Today, we take a look at the Soil Health Card Scheme launched by the government on the 19th for February 2015. The Soil Health Card scheme was launched with a view to address the decline of soil nutrients. The scheme provides for the analysis of soil composition by the State Governments once in every two years so that remedial steps can be taken to improve soil nutrients. Farmers can track their soil samples and also obtain their Soil Health Card report. In his Mann Ki Baat programme on 26th November, 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that he is very glad to see that farmers have come forward to implement the suggestions made in the soil health card. " मिट्टी की क्वालिटी में भी सुधार आया फ़र्टिलाइज़र के उपयोग कम होने के कारण आर्थिक बचत भी हुई। मुझे यह देखकर काफी खुशी है कि मेरे किसान भाई सॉइल हेल्थ कार्ड मृदा स्वास्थ्य कार्ड में दी गई सलाह पर अमल करने के लिए आगे आए हैं। और जैसे - जैसे परिणाम मिल रहे हैं उनका उत्साह भी बढ़ता जा रहा है।और अब किसान को भी लग रहा है कि अगर फसल की चिंता करनी है तो पहले धरती मां का ख्याल रखना होगा। और अगर हम धरती मां का ख्याल रखेंगे तो धरती मां हम सबका ख्याल रखेगी। " Our correspondent reports that this card has enabled the farmers to understand the soil health parameters and improve its productivity by judicious application of soil nutrients. "Under the scheme, a soil health card is given to farmers which carry crop-wise recommendations of nutrients and fertilizers required for the individual farms. The Soil Health Card provides information on soil nutrient status along with recommendation on appropriate dosage of nutrient for improving soil health and its fertility. The Card also promotes judicious use of fertilisers so that the cultivation cost can be reduced. It helps farmers to improve productivity by maintaining soil health. With Dipendra, Anand Kumar, AIR News, Delhi." <><><> The Soil Health Card scheme introduced by the Union Government nationwide forms part of the roadmap to double the farmers' income besides improving soil fertility. Our Chennai Correspondent gives an account of the scheme in the state of Tamil Nadu:- "In Tamil Nadu, officials say over 81.18 lakh soil health cards have been given to the farmers. The soil testing has been done free of cost, and the card has details about the nutrient and micro-nutrient levels. Mr Rajamani, a beneficiary from Kanchipuram district says it has helped to minimise fertilizers and at the same time get maximum yield. Earlier, we indiscriminately used fertilizers but now, through the Soil Health Card scheme, the officials test the soil and recommend the right kind of fertilizers and the right quantity that are required. It has helped us to get a good yield. Agriculture still remains the backbone of the nation’s rural economy. And the Soil Health Card scheme is helping in rejuvenating the farmlands and to infuse renewed hope in the lives of the farmers.
