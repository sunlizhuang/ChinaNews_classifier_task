Shenzhen CIMC-TianDa Airport Support Ltd, China's major provider of boarding bridges, has further expanded its global presence by securing an over 70 million yuan ($10 million) deal in the Philippines.

The Shenzhen, Guangdong province-based company in South China will supply 18 boarding bridges and related equipment to Clark International Airport in the Philippines, marking the biggest airport order in the Southeast Asian country.

The airport, which serves as a major aviation infrastructure in the Clark Special Economic Zone, is currently under renovation and is expected to come into service in the second half of 2020.

"Clark is of great political and economic significance to the Philippines. Obtaining the order will produce a demonstration effect," said Li Rongduo, general manager of CIMC-TianDa's international marketing center.

It is not the first cooperation between CIMC-TianDa and the Philippines. The company has been providing equipment for Manila Ninoy Aquino International Airport and Mactan-Cebu International Airport.

CIMC-TianDa now accounts for roughly 40 percent of the world's boarding bridge market, with its business covering more than 300 airports in over 70 countries and regions globally. More than 6,000 boarding bridges have been or are expected to be delivered.
