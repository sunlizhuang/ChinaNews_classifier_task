Plans for a new rehabilitation centre for alcoholics have been welcomed by business owners - but not everyone is happy.

The O'Connor Centre already runs similar facilities in East Staffordshire.

Now the latest venture will be in Hanley and will be solely for people with drink problems, not drug users.

A scheme has been lodged with Stoke-on-Trent City Council to open near Hanley bus station in Birch Terrace, close to the heart of the city centre.

The rehab centre will not be residential but patients will be able to visit and speak with healthcare professionals on site.

It will also have two parking spaces at its rear.

Traders have broadly welcomed the plans for a new business in the crumbling row.

He said: "I'd just be glad if they did something along here with some of these buildings. It's the first thing people see when they come to the city and it's a mess either side.

"These were lovely buildings years ago - the synagogue and what have you. I'm the only one left really. There were doctors, dentists and accountants."

Amy Shutt, practice manager of The Dental Centre, has also welcomed the proposals.

She said: "It's good because there's not much going on down here to be honest. Being a private practice, it may put patients off a little, but it's good. A lot of buildings aren't in use around here are they, it's just getting worse."

Yang Xiang, who owns the Chinese Medical and Skin Centre, has recently relocated from one property at the end of the block a few doors down. He said: "It's a good idea, why not."

But a 68-year-old shopper, from Meir Hay, who did not wish to be named, has concerns.

As she waited for the number 11 bus, she told StokeonTrentLive: "They throw everything here, don't they. It's not nice to have one of them is it? There's enough up Hanley walking the blinking streets. I wouldn't want one there.

"They'd be better off on a desert island - ship the lot of them. Nobody really wants one of them do they?"

The building has been described as 'scruffy' by Staffordshire Police. The force supports the plans, but has raised concerns over burglaries.

It has recommended security shutters and CCTV cameras be installed.

The building is already undergoing renovation and was formerly used as office space. If approved, the business hours will be from 8.30am to 4.30pm every day.

Stoke-on-Trent City Council is set to decide on the change of use plans in the coming weeks.

The O'Connor Centre has declined to comment while the application is pending.
