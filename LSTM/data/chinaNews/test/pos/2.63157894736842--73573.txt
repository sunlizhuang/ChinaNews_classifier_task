ALFRED — An informational meeting to increase awareness about Chinese human rights activist Ding Jiaxi, “Human Rights Emergency Meeting: A Family's Story, A Chinese Story. Free Ding Jiaxi” is scheduled for Monday at 5:30 p.m. in Holmes Auditorium, Harder Hall. Originally, it had been set to be held in Nevins Theater.

According to his wife, Alfred University alumna Shengchun “Sophie” Luo, Ding has been detained by Chinese authorities since late December and has been denied contact with his attorney and family members. She says her husband, a China-based human rights lawyer, was among a group rounded up by police after a gathering on Dec. 26, 2019, and is being held by Chinese authorities in a secret location. She will also discuss Ding Jiaxi’s part in the New Citizens’ Movement in China, which advocates for political change.

Sophie Luo earned a master’s degree in materials science and engineering from Alfred University in 2003. She still lives in Alfred and remains close to some members of the Alfred University community. At the meeting, Sophie Luo will tell her family’s story.

In addition to learning about Ding Jiaxi’s plight, and human rights issues in China, those attending the meeting will have an opportunity to sign a petition urging his release, and volunteer to help bring attention to his situation. Alfred University students already volunteering with efforts to free Ding Jiaxi will be present to discuss how the public can assist in their ongoing human rights activism.

Free pizza and soda will be available for attendees.
