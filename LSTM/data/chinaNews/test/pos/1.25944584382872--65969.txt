Pakistan’s complex foreign policy interests and aspirations are intertwined with its geographical proximity to several middle powers as well as aspiring superpower states with whom its relations are defined by strategic interests, or conflicts, to a large extent. Yet some of its regional ties are also based on commonalities of perceptions and mutual respect which led to forging long-term alliances such as those with China, Turkey and the Gulf states.

In a marked departure from the past, Prime Minister Imran Khan’s foreign policy is defined by mutual respect with all states irrespective of their importance. Over the last 18 months alone, his government has managed to not only maintain ties with traditional regional allies but also renew friendship with Washington DC, Tehran and Kuala Lumpur. This is a worthwhile feat, given how the state has historically faced difficulties because of being tied to certain blocs.

On an interesting note, a unique ‘Engage Africa’ conference was also held in Nairobi recently where Pakistan-Africa trade ties were explored in pursuance of a policy jointly adopted in November 2019 by the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Commerce. Credit for that, primarily, goes to Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Secretary Commerce Sardar Ahmad Nawaz Sukhera.

The intense diplomacy of the last 18 months has, however, taken its toll in terms of not enough attention being paid to the working of the Foreign Office itself. While Foreign Minister Qureshi and Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood are both decent men who are working hard to pursue the country’s foreign policy interests, they are no match to the Machiavellian games being played within the Foreign Office. This has led to undeserving pretenders, who know how to wear their patriotism on the sleeves and are able to sell the mantras in vogue as their own, to get top diplomatic assignments. Sadly, such conspirators are running the roost while some of the most capable diplomats have been pushed to the side-lines.

While it’s true that a bulk of career diplomats are striving to represent the state in the best possible manner, there are some glaring exceptions where those who work for self-interests alone have conspired to manage some of the most important stations abroad in violation of all norms of seniority, merit and rules.

Foreign Minister Qureshi, despite being one of the most experienced ministers in the Khan government, has unfortunately been unable to stem this tide of mediocrity that is stealthily climbing the ever-glorious heights of the Foreign Office’s assignments abroad.

In some ways, this reminds one of the bureaucratic manipulations portrayed in the classic 1980s British satirical shows ‘Yes Minister’ and ‘Yes Prime Minister’.

One way out of this sad state of affairs would be for the prime minister to appoint a Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs as has been the case in the past. The SAPM could fill in the gap created by the foreign minister’s hectic schedule of foreign engagements and allow for a more focused supervision of the internal working of the Foreign Office to ensure merit and best possible representation of Pakistan abroad.

The ideal candidate for such an appointment would be the former envoy to the US, the UK and the UN, Dr. Maleeha Lodhi, who is a widely respected diplomat with the distinction of being envoy to most important stations abroad longer than any career diplomat in Pakistan’s history. While she would understand the requirements of representation abroad better than anybody else presently, her not being from the Foreign Service of Pakistan (FSP) cadre would mean that she would not have the constraints of having any past favourites and could be totally impartial.

For many, Dr. Lodhi’s sudden departure in September 2019, despite her very accomplished tenure, was shocking but not entirely unexpected, given that her successor had been trying to lobby in the power corridors since long to land the coveted post in New York City.

Nobody would argue that Dr. Lodhi still has a lot to give to the nation, and as SAPM on Foreign Affairs she would be most valuable in ensuring that Pakistan’s foreign policy apparatus abroad is run by the most capable as well as the most suitable. Foreign Minister Qureshi would be well advised to suggest this appointment to the prime minister that could go a long way in pursuance of his ambitious foreign policy agenda, which requires employing the best available talent to its most productive use.

In such testing times when New Delhi’s fascism is gaining an upper hand against minorities, including the people of Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IoJ&K), Dr. Lodhi would be the ideal person to counter its deceptive policies on a much larger scale in international forums and key world capitals.
