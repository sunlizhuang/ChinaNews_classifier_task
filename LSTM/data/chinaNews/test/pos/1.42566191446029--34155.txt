Starlux Airlines Taipei to Penang

Starlux Airlines on 23 January commenced service from Taipei to Da Nang (Vietnam), Macau, and Penang (Malaysia). The Taiwanese new entrant, which says it wants to be the “Emirates of Taipei”, has launched services with a fleet of A321neos, with orders for 17 A350s from 2022. The carrier’s 188-seat A321neos feature eight lie-flat business class seats and 180 economy.

Its initial routes, all leisure destinations, are interesting given its repeated statements about luxury and its lie-flat beds. In the week starting 29 January, its existing routes have been one and four other competitors:

Taipei – Da Nang: 36 weekly frequencies in all; four competitors; Starlux has a 14-weekly service

Taipei – Macau: 106 weekly frequencies; three competitors; Starlux’s 21-weekly service is the least

Taipei – Penang: 14 weekly frequencies; one competitor; Starlux has a daily service

Cebu next route to launch from S20; Japan likely regional target

Cebu will be Starlux’ next route, launching on 06 April according to OAG Schedules Analyser. It will be intriguing to see how the carrier’s business model will fare against well-established China Airlines and EVA Air and Taipei’s growing penetration by low-cost carriers.
