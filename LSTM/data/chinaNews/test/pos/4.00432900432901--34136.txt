Behind the numbers, Kantar has identified seven macro-trends that will reshape the retail landscape in the first half of the new decade. To unlock growth retailers will need to remain relevant by constantly seeking ways to redefine commerce and creating seamless experiences across diverse channels. They’ll also need to establish more meaningful connections with consumers through effective use of data-driven insights. With consumers placing greater emphasis on sustainability, brands will also need to demonstrate they’re aligned with consumers’ values in authentic ways.

1. Asia is inspiring global retailers: With mobile-first, data-powered models, Asia’s digital retail landscape is inspiring global retailers to roll out new channel-less, online2offline initiatives. Growth potential is not limited to China, with India and Indonesia offering new opportunities, thanks to the spread of giants such as Alibaba, and innovative incumbent players such as Flipkart and on-demand retail models like Grab.

2. Cross-border – Opening up the world through unified practices: Cross-border trade is becoming a big topic for market regulators, with 2020 bringing more unified practices, particularly for ecommerce. While Alibaba and Amazon bring simplification, cross-border will disrupt pricing corridors, inventory management, and create grey areas in legislative frameworks.

3. Margins – Balancing growth with profitability calls for evolution in retail economics: Established retailers are under increasing pressure toadopt new financial models to allow for more resources and relevance, calling for a structural retail evolution. Margin continues to be a priority, but it is to be achieved through innovation, differentiation and new partnerships.

4. Visibility – Standing out from the crowd requires new mindsets and skillsets: The proliferation of touchpoints, inception moments and evolving retail economy makes it harder for brands to ensure visibility and show up in a consistent manner where the consumer expects to find them. Stores will evolve to reflect shopper desire for both simplification and engagement.

5. Accessibility – Exploiting everywhere being a sales and marketing opportunity: Retail seeks to inspire loyalty by creating solutions and building ecosystems that are in sync with new consumer lifestyles. As these evolve to create seamless online-offline connections, they enable better decision-making, boost speed, and automate shopping.

6. Purpose – Resonating with consumers’ values in genuine ways: Retail is no more just about business but about vision. Shoppers, especially centennials, want to push for social change and find purpose. A demand from consumers and a requirement by investors influence relationships with suppliers, communications with shoppers, and trade execution.

7. Relevance – Embracing algorithmic retail to connect with consumers: Algorithmic retailing will infuse activities at every channel, creating constant connection with shoppers. For brands, this is a great opportunity to leverage retailer platforms to activate new purchasing moments, both physical and digital.

Malcolm Pinkerton, vice president retail IQ, commented: “As we progress into this new decade omnichannel will fast become mainstream, with emerging markets setting the pace of change. Designing for missions and occasions, not channels and touchpoints, will define the winners. Recognising ‘everywhere’ is now a sales and marketing opportunity and that being accessible at each one, will be essential to unlocking growth.”

Derya Guvenc, principal analyst, Retail I, commented: “Retailer business models will come under intense pressure to transform, as the need for agility and innovation intensifies to accommodate consumer expectations. To adapt, brands should drive for total value chain approach to category planning and assortment management for ‘total customer growth’. While efficiency and profitability are high on the agenda, enhancing sustainability credentials must be a near-term priority for brands if they’re to remain on consumers’ preference list.”
