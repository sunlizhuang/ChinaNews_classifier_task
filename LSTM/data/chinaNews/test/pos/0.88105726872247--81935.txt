It’s been called many things from “A Bastion of Discovery” to “The Future of Film” to “The Cure”. I set down with the co-founders of the Cinequest Film & Creativity Festival to find out what they call it. The answers were quite divergent.

“I call it a lot of sleepless nights.”—Cinequest Co-founder & President Kathleen J. Powell

Powell’s partner holds a more lofty view:

“Cinequest is a qualitative organization, focusing on impact to an individual or a community — rippling to the world. Cinequest’s uniqueness stems from being always ahead of the curve in the giving of opportunity, the democratization of voice and the disruption of outdated systems. It’s a celebration of Maverick originality, a laboratory of new ideas, and an enabler of creativity, all rolled into one.” — Cinequest Co-founder & CEO Halfdan Hussey

Whatever you want to call it, one thing’s for sure, the Cinequest Film & Creativity Festival is happening March 3 – 15 in San Jose and Redwood City, California. And there’s a lot happening:

Let’s talk film. There’s 140 World and U.S. Premiere movies. How do you sort through them to find what you want? They’ve devised a system they call “Cinequesters”, emotive categories including Laughs, Inspiration, Life, Thrills, Innovation, and Celebration (which means parties with films—more on that later).

I couldn’t get the program director to give me his top picks (as he said with a grin “Cinequest must love all their children equally”), but I did get an anonymous programmer to give some staff picks including:

Move over film, VR, I mean AR, is the new rage at Cinequest. They exist in the Silicon Valley and have been known as the place to discover new media technologies. From digital film making to delivery, you would have experienced much of the firsts at Cinequest past…and some great experiments like three screen cinema as well. Their new bag (fourth year of it) is a Virtual and Augmented reality showcase running in parallel with the film festival. Here’s a few highlights:

DINO MUNDI | XR Experience | Travel to an ancient time when dinosaurs ruled our young planet where you’ll walk and be transported through 3 different worlds of dinosaurs. An experience which will engage all your senses. Country: USA & Brazil (North American Premiere)

WARPED | VR Cinema | Director(s): Bryan Robbins | Piloting a spacecraft around a space station to investigate a signal disturbance, you’re suddenly greeted by unfriendly visitors. Country: USA (World Premiere)

The Maverick theme’s been with them from day one. After all, these folks have Steve Wozniak and Marty Cooper on their leadership council so they know what doing something wild and crazy means. The founders speak of the Maverick as being the best of the spirit of the innovator and the artist and tell the story of the word’s origin: “Samuel L. Maverick was a rancher whose calves were the only unbranded ones.” They have given their Maverick Spirit Award to Nicolas Cage, Rosario Dawson, J.J. Abrams, Harrison Ford, and Elle Fanning. This year it goes to Hong Chau, Ruth Weiss, and Jesse Eisenberg.

I guess that’s not enough folks… They’ve started adding in more performance art. They call them Creativity Experiences. Some are stand alone and some are added value performances before movies.

And like all great celebrations (and this is their 30th anniversary), they’ve got plenty of parties to boot. The Opening Celebration includes Matt Donaher’s standup before the unveiling of John Pinette: You Go Now. The After Party includes a DJ showdown and more at The Glass House. The Closing Event focusses on Eisenberg’s new film Resistance and a party at Corinthian Ballroom. In between they have a full lineup of happy-hour meetups called Soirees in various San Jose venues plus the new Chan Zuckerberg Institute facility in Redwood City. They have a series of nightly Socials in San Jose and a great “cheap-date” concept called Redwood City Meet The Artists Parties which gets you a film, booze, and music for $20.

I asked co-founder Powell if she was going to get any sleep during the festival. “Unlikely,” she replied. For the good of Cinequest and those who enjoy it, I do hope she finds time to rest after March 15.
