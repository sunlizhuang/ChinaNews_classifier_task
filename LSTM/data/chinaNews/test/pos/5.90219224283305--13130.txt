Ms. Fouzia Saeed, Director General PNCA, Mr. Li Yanxuan, Deputy Director China Cultural Center in Pakistan and 500-plus diverse audience attended the gala.

Chinese Happy New Year or the Spring Festival is the grandest festival in China, with a 7-day long holiday. During this period, the iconic red lanterns, loud fireworks, massive banquets and parades, add color and exuberance to the celebrations.

Unlike the universal New Year observed on January 1st, Chinese New Year does not have a fixed date. In 2020 Chinese New Year festival falls on January 25. It is the Year of the Rat according to the Chinese zodiac, which features a 12-year cycle with each year represented by a specific animal. People born in the Years of the Rat including 1936, 1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996, and 2008 will experience their Zodiac Year of Birth (Ben Ming Nian). “Rats are clever, quick thinkers; successful, but content with living a quiet and peaceful life.”

On the occasion of Chinese New Year, every house is decorated with the most favored color, the bright Red – red lanterns, Chinese knots, Spring Festival couplets, ‘Fu’ character pictures, and red window paper-cuts.

All Chinese people visit their family home for a reunion dinner with the whole family. New clothes are also believed to bring good luck and start over fresh. People will add new red clothing to their Spring Festival wardrobe too.

The essential course on all Chinese menus for a reunion dinner will be steamed or braised whole fish, representing a surplus every year. Various kinds of meat, vegetable, and seafood are made into dishes with auspicious meanings. Dumplings are indispensable for northerners, while rice cakes for southerners. The night is spent enjoying this feast along with cheerful family talk and laughter.
