Taiwan’s president Tsai Ing-wen has written to Pope Francis describing China’s aggression and persecution of religion as “obstacles to peace,” and detailing the Communist regime’s “abuses of power.”

“The crux of the issue is that China refuses to relinquish its desire to dominate Taiwan. It continues to undermine Taiwan’s democracy, freedom, and human rights with threats of military force and the implementation of disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks, and diplomatic maneuvers,” Tsai wrote in a letter to the Pope published by her office on January 21.

Tsai sent the letter in response to Pope Francis’ message for the 2020 World Day of Peace, the Pope’s annual letter sent to all foreign ministers around the world to mark the new year.

This year, the Pope’s letter entitled: “Peace as a Journey of Hope: Dialogue, Reconciliation and Ecological Conversion,” called on “the conscience of humanity” to rise up in the face of “every desire for dominance and destruction.” [FULL STORY]
