The Department of Health must hasten the procedures in tracking the airline passengers who might have had contact with the male Chinese national who tested positive for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease (2019-nCoV ARD) infection and later died of pneumonia.

DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III admitted during the Senate Committee on Health hearing on Tuesday that so far, they have traced only 17 percent, or 58 of 331 individuals, of the passengers who were in the same flights as the 44-year-old deceased and his 38-year-old female companion, who is also infected.

They country’s only two positive cases so far arrived in the Philippines from Wuhan via Hong Kong on 21 January and visited Cebu and Dumaguete.

One of them died on 1 February.

In a statement released by spokesperson Cielo Villaluna, PAL confirmed it has “released to the Department of Health, through the Bureau of Quarantine, the full unredacted manifest of our 25 January 2020 flight PR2542 from Dumaguete to Manila , which includes the contact details of the passengers on the flight. We are also assisting the BOQ in the call-out of the passengers. We will always do our part to cooperate fully with the responsible authorities when it concerns the health and safety of the general public.”

PAL has contacted 74 passengers on the flight, 21 of them having sat close to the couple.

The couple arrived in Cebu from Hong Kong on 21 January via Cebu Pacific flight 5J 241. They then boarded another Cebu Pacific flight (DG 6519) from Cebu to Dumaguete and Philippine Airlines (PR 2542) from Dumaguete to Manila.

Duque said “heads will roll” due to the slow action of some health officials.

Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go, Health committee chair, said Duque has the right to do so.

“That is his prerogative po kung gusto niyang tanggalin ang mga tao niya. Bilang committee chair naman po ay nakatutok kami rito sa Senado,” Go said.

Go also agreed with Duque’s statement that the coordination between government agencies should be improved.

“Dapat ayusin ninyo ‘yung sistema ninyo, coordination, kaya nga meron kayong Inter-Agency Task Force para pag-usapan at gumawa kayo ng solusyon sa bawat problemang darating sa atin,” Go said.

The senator said he is open to calling another public hearing on the 2019 nCov ARD if necessary.

“Kung kakailanganin po, magpapatawag ako, para mawala ‘yung pangamba ng mga Pilipino,” Go said.
