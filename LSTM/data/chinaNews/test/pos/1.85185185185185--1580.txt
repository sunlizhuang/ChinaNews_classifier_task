(ONN) – In northeast Ohio, a community is considering becoming a so-called “second amendment sanctuary.”

In Canton, community members are discussing the possibility of turning Stark County into a “second amendment sanctuary.”

This refers to a local government that does not follow state or federal gun laws that prohibit or impede the second amendment.

Residents gathered recently to start the conversation and discuss how they will convince county commissioners to pass the resolution.

It has been confirmed that the group plans to start a petition with a goal of 126,000 valid signatures before they take their idea to the board.
