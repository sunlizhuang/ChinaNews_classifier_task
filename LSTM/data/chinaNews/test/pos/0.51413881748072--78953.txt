Mr Macdonald is being tried, along with former Labor minister Eddie Obeid and his son Moses, for allegedly conspiring over a coal mining licence in the Bylong Valley in Mudgee in 2009.

The crown alleges that the Obeid family stood to gain $60 million from a compromised tender process, and that then-NSW mining minister Mr Macdonald leaked inside information to the Obeids about the deal.

All three men have pleaded not guilty, and the case continues.

Mr Albanese said by the end of the lunch in 2006, there was a "general agreement" that Mr Macdonald would be allowed to contest to election, but that he would resign around halfway through the parliamentary term.

Former NSW Labor leader Luke Foley, who convened the meeting in his capacity as then assistant general secretary of the party's state branch, told the court earlier in the morning that Mr Macdonald had sought to maximise his tenure.

Mr Foley said he opposed Mr Macdonald's preselection on the grounds that "he had a good run" since his election to the NSW upper house in 1988, but that he recognised the older powerbroker enjoyed the support of the premier and " a couple of serious unions".

"I think we all understood that [Mr Macdonald] had a pretty strong hand," Mr Foley said, adding that the former minister had also brought up the cost of his daughter's high school education as another reason for wanting to remain in the parliament.

The meeting at Noble House, a Chinese restaurant in the Sydney CBD, was attended by Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union general secretary Paul Bastian, and former senators George Campbell and Doug Cameron, as well as Mr Albanese, Mr Foley and Mr Macdonald.

Mr Bastian had initially been scheduled to appear before the court on Thursday, but the Crown withdrew him as a witness.

Justice Elizabeth Fullerton questioned whether Mr Bastian and Mr Albanese still needed to be called to take the stand, after Mr Foley's "very clear" evidence on the 2006 meeting.

During his 12-minute appearance before the NSW Supreme Court, Mr Albanese said there was one argument from Mr Macdonald in favour of his own preselection that he did not buy.

"Someone attending the Olympics wasn't seen by me, certainly, as a reason for why someone should be preselected," Mr Albanese said.
