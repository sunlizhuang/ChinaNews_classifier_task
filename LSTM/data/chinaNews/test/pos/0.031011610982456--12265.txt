China’s president, on a visit to Myanmar, took in the sights with a tour of the Buddhist temples in Bagan and vowed to pour investment into the country even as the United Nations criticised the local government for violation of human rights.

That was 19 years ago and the visitor was Jiang Zemin.

On Friday, when President Xi Jinping arrives in Myanmar for the first state visit since 2001, he may well gaze upon the same temples his predecessor saw, he will repeat plans for investment in the neighbouring country, and again Myanmar faces condemnation over human rights abuses. What’s changed, though, is China and its ambitions.

In between the two visits, China leapfrogged Thailand to become Myanmar’s biggest trading partner and eventually unseated Japan as the world’s second-largest economy after the US. With that economic clout, Beijing asserted itself in international affairs – China now has more embassies around the world than any other country – only to bang heads with the West, especially the US, as its influence spread.

Closer to home China has exercised claims over regions of the South China Sea, causing disputes with Asian neighbours from Vietnam to the Philippines and Indonesia.

Myanmar is different. The two countries share a 2,200km land border, China’s longest after Russia and Mongolia, and have 70 years of diplomatic relations, the longest held by the People’s Republic of China. All of which presents a particular opportunity for Xi and Beijing’s broader ambitions when he arrives in the capital Naypyidaw for his first state visit of 2020.

Oil and gas pipelines

The opportunities are in more pipelines to expand alternative land routes for the Middle East oil and gas China now imports by tanker to keep its economy running, as well as access to other resources in Myanmar itself, including energy. With an eye on the economic benefits, Beijing has always taken a hands-off approach to Myanmar politics.

That may also prove useful in China’s dealing with the Association of South East Asian Nations, or Asean, which Myanmar is a member of and also includes nations in dispute with Beijing over the South China Sea.

When Jiang visited, he said Myanmar’s military junta government “must be allowed to choose its own development path”.

That was after world condemnation of a bloody crackdown by the military in 1988 on protesters demanding democratic reforms. The military government in 2010 began loosening its control and allowing some political freedoms, leading to installation of a government led by former opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

While the country is now less isolated, the Myanmar military has once again been accused of attacks on civilians, in this case the Rohingya Muslim ethnic group in August 2017, which caused the Rohingya to flee across the border into Bangladesh where as many as 700,000 live in refugee camps.

The United Nations has labelled the attacks on the Rohingya as acts of genocidal intent, while UN secretary general Antonio Guterres has said the Rohingya lacked the most basic of human rights in Myanmar.

Myanmar’s government has rejected the UN charges and China has said the issue was a domestic affair to be dealt with by the government.

China’s support of Myanmar’s opening and its stance on the Rohingya issue will be crucial for Suu Kyi before a general election in November as the West withdraws or imposes sanctions on the country, said Fan Hongwei, a professor at Xiamen University’s Research School of Southeast Asian Studies.

‘A friend in need’

Xi’s trip was to cement fraternal ties, China’s ambassador to Myanmar Chen Hai told state news agency Xinhua in an interview this week.

China has been Myanmar’s closest ally for two decades, offering economic and military aid during Jiang’s visit in 2001 amid Western sanctions after the military’s crackdown, said Yun Sun, a senior fellow at the Stimson Centre in Washington. Relations took a step back during Myanmar’s political reform, but now China has repaired its ties and regained its influence.
