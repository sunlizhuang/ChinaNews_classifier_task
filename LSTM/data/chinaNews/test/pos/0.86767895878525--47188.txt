The UK nationals put in to quarantine with suspected coronavirus have revealed what it's like living at the Arrowe Park Hospital.

The 83 British nationals arrived at the hospital on the Wirral on Friday night where they will remain for 14 days to prevent the spread of the deadly respiratory illness.

While there they will be allowed to contact family and have been given "a bag of essentials", according to one man staying at the NHS facility.

Footage sent to 5 news producer Eleanor Gregory shows the patients talking about the bag of essentials they were given on arrival.

Speaking from inside the hospital, patient Matt Raw said: "There's a bag here containing various essentials we might need, underwear and things people might not have had time to pack.

"It's a perfectly nice room, we've got all the essentials we need. We do have a concierge here who is attending to our absolute every need. It's like staying in a hotel.

"Imagine the best hotel you've ever stayed in and the best service you could ever possibly imagine - these guys at the NHS wipe the floor with the lot of them.

"Anything we've asked for, TVs, hair dryers they go out and obtain them for us in a flash."

Children also staying at the hospital have been given dolls, Xbox consoles and Playstations which will occupy them during their two-week stay.

The Brits who arrived were seen to be given hand sanitizer and mouth masks for protection.

Patients were also given boxed bacon alongside a selection of cereals for their breakfast.

It included patients being delivered Rice Krispies, Kellogg's Corn Flakes, bananas, and bacon.

In a statement on Saturday a Public Health Wales spokesman confirmed a small number of patients were being tested but said there were "currently no confirmed cases" of the disease in Wales.

Dr Giri Shankar, professional lead consultant for health protection at Public Health Wales, said: “For reasons of patient confidentiality Public Health Wales is not able to comment on individual cases.

“We can confirm that all Welsh residents that meet the current testing criteria are being offered testing.

“We are not disclosing the number of individuals tested in Wales because they are so low they run the risk of being patient-identifiable.
