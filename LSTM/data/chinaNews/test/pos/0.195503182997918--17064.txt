Northwest Ohio financial holding company set to merger with Youngstown-based Home Savings after receiving regulatory approvals.

DEFIANCE Regulatory agencies have approved a plan for First Defiance Financial Group to merge with the Youngstown-based parent company of Home Savings Bank.

The combined operations will have more than 70 branches in four states, including one Stark County location, a Home Savings office at 6141 Whipple Ave. NW in Jackson Township.

First Defiance Financial and United Community Financial Corp. — holding company for Home Savings — announced their planned merger in September. It's expected that the deal will close before the end of the month.

Before completing the merger, First Defiance, which is unitary thrift holding company, will convert to a bank holding company with financial holding company status. First Federal Bank will convert from a federal savings association to become an Ohio-chartered commercial bank.

The combined operation will be based in Defiance.

The company will rebrand its bank branches, although a new name hasn't been announced. Customer account conversion will be completed.

Plans call for a 13-member board of directors that will include Canton businessman Louis M. Altman; Gary Small, president and chief executive officer of United Community; and Richard J. Schiraldi, United Community chairman.

Homes Savings Bank was founded in 1889 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of United Community. It has 32 branches in Ohio and one in Pennsylvania, along with residential home mortgage centers in Ohio, West Virginia, western Pennsylvania, northern Kentucky and eastern Indiana.

Home Savings entered the Stark County market in 2016 when it bought Ohio Legacy Corp., parent of Premier Bank & Trust. Ohio Legacy formed in 2000 when investors from Stark and Wayne counties decided to create local bank.

First Defiance is holding company for First Federal Bank of the Midwest and First Insurance Group. It has 44 bank branches in northwest and central Ohio, southeastern Michigan and northeastern Indiana, while First Insurance has nine officers in northwest Ohio.
