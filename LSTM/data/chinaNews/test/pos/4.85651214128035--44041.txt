VACAVILLE — The “Rat Pack” was on hand Friday at the McBride Senior Center to celebrate the Chinese New Year, the Year of the Rat.

Charlene Hall, who worked at Fisher House on Travis Air Force Base, picked up the tab for a dozen guests and added to the festivities with decorated gift bags holding black mouse ears reading “Rat 20,” a small stuffed rat animal and goodies she purchased.

Marge Tye was one of the lucky guests at the table.

“She does this every year,” Tye said of Hall. “We look forward to it.”

Hall mailed out invitations to friends that included former David Grant employees, Fisher House volunteers and few members of the widows group that meets at the McBride Senior Center.

The way to get an invite, Hall said, was “to be my friend.”

“It’s a get together with friends,” Hall said. “We don’t get to see each other that often.”

It’s also the perfect opportunity to “bring out the inner child,” she said.

Hall is prepared to host another table when Cinco de Mayo rolls around.

“I’ve already got my tickets,” she said.

Approximately 150 people attended the annual event Friday, said Audrey Calder, who oversees the operation of the center for the city of Vacaville.

Partygoers came from all over Solano County.

Calder, in her welcome, asked guests to keep the residents of China in their thoughts and prayers. The country is dealing with the outbreak of a potentially deadly coronavirus.

Also enjoying the festivities were freshmen and sophomore students of Stephanie Chou, a special education teacher in the Fairfield-Suisun School District. They arrived early to help set up the room.

“It’s an opportunity to see the world outside,” Chou said. “And, to learn social skills.”

A few tables away were the young adults Spring Howerter works with each weekday. They create a variety of gifts that are sold in the This & That Gift Shop inside the McBride Senior Center. The shop, operated by students, is open from 9 a.m. to noon weekdays.

Sophia Brace was one of them. She wore a sparkly red dress with touches of gold in honor of the Chinese New Year. Fried rice was on her mind as the food was served.

Lonza Reed was thinking of orange chicken. He is also in Howerter’s program, which makes everything from lanyards to floral arrangements.

Both enjoyed opening their fortune cookies. Reed’s advised him his greatest fear would become his greatest strength. Brace’s spoke of her laughter being a light in the world.

Howerter felt her fortune, “You Are A Leader,” was spot on. She’s attending school in hopes of working as a school principal in the future.
