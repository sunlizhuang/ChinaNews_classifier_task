Moss Side school kids have sent a kind message to their Chinese friends ahead of the Lantern Festival.

Year 5 pupils at St Mary's Church of England Primary are showing their support for the Chinese community ahead of a poignant moment in the Chinese calendar.

The Lantern Festival, known as Yuan Xiao, traditionally marks the end of Chinese New Year and celebrates family, reunions and society.

It is often returned to as the 'true' Chinese Valentine's Day and takes place on Saturday.

Many will not be able to travel to see loved ones in China, and at a time when Coronavirus is dominating the headlines, the Year 5 class wanted to offer their support – and their own version of a Valentine’s message showing love and appreciation.

Ten-year-old Grace wrote: "We are really sorry you cannot travel to visit your family. But you need to remember that you have family in Manchester and it is us. We want to help you as much as we can and welcome you here....All the rights we have here you can have too because you're in Manchester."

There are plans for the work will be translated as an act of solidarity, and to be sent to a linked primary school in Wuhan.

Headteacher Jenny McGarry, said: “A large part of our teaching is about being a global citizen. And as part of that it means we think about all nationalities and making sure people feel included in daily life.

“We also know that China couldn’t celebrate New Year in its normal style while there are concerns over Coronavirus – so, our children decided to help with that.”

Coun Luthfur Rahman, Manchester City Council’s Executive Member with responsibility for the Skills for Life, said: “So often children will see the heart of an issue more clearly than anyone else.

"That clarity makes this message of support even more poignant – I hope all our Chinese community and especially students who are a long way from their families sense that empathy.”
