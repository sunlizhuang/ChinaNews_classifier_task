An unidentified Chinese man has been praised on social networks after a video showed him handing out free face masks to passengers arriving at Suvarnabhumi airport - his personal contribution to the fight against the Wuhan virus.

Fourteen cases of infection have already been detected in Thailand - all people arriving from infected areas in China.

The clip, posted by Facebook user Graipass Chaleechai on Tuesday, shows the man, wearing a face mask and holding a sign in Chinese, handing out face masks to people at the airport on Tuesday night.

The Facebook user quoted the man as saying “I do for China, for friends’’ when he spoke to him. The Chinese man declined to give his name.

The unknown man drew praise for his actions after the clip was shared online.

On Tuesday, health permanent secretary Sukhum Kanchanapimai said another six Chinese nationals entering Thailand were found to be infected with the Wuhan coronavirus, bringing a total number of cases detected in the country to 14.

Five of them were family members travelling from China’s Hubei province, Dr Sukhum said. Health officials had tested them all twice, and confirmed they were positive for the novel coronavirus, he added.
