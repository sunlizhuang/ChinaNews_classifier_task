KALAMAZOO, MI (WKZO AM/FM) -- The Chinese Association of Greater Kalamazoo (CAGK), in collaboration with The Confucius Institute at Western Michigan University (CIWMU), is preparing to celebrate the 2020 Chinese New Year.

The celebration comes in the form of the 39th Annual Chinese New Year Gala. 2020 marks the Year of the Rat.

Each year, the Chinese New Year Gala holds several different types of art and performance displays to celebrate Chinese heritage. The organization says the Gala this year will include Lion Dance, traditional Chinese song and dance, contemporary Chinese music, and more.

Additionally, some streets in the downtown area and some area businesses will join the celebration thanks to the Kalamazoo Chinese Academy and the Downtown Kalamazoo Partnership.

“The Kalamazoo atmosphere is exciting this year with a lot to see and do in relation to the Chinese New Year, KCA board member Christopher Hodshire said. "It clearly is something our community should continue to embrace as it appears to become bigger and better each and every year.”

The Chinese New Year Gala will take place on Saturday, January 25, beginning at 7:00 PM at Chenery Auditorium. Chenery Auditorium is located at 714 South Westnedge Avenue in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

Ticket prices are $14 for Non-members $14, $8 for members, $8 for children 12 and under, and free for children 4 and under.

Ticket can be purchased in person from Pacific Rim Foods, the Kalamazoo Chinese Academy, and the Kalamazoo Chinese Christian Church. Tickets can also be purchased on the day of the event at the Chenery Auditorium.
