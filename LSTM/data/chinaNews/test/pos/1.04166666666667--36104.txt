MASHONALAND West province is looking at ways of leveraging on twinning arrangements it entered into with provinces in Zambia, Namibia and China.

The twinning arrangements have already started yielding results with Kavango East region in Namibia offering the province 40 hectares of land for farming.

Kavango East region governor Dr Samuel Mbambo visited the province in 2017 before Mashonaland West Minister of State Mary Mliswa-Chikoka reciprocated to consummate the twinning agreement.

The hot semi-arid region has relatively higher rainfall (579mm annually) than other regions in Namibia, making it suitable for wheat, maize production and agro-forestry.

This comes as Southern Province in Zambia has set its sights on Mashonaland West province’s horticultural produce, providing a vast market of about 2 million people.

On its part, Mashonaland West province is eyeing Southern Province’s cattle sector. The Southern Province has vast cattle ranches.

In her address to Mashonaland West’s provincial heads, managers of parastatals and local authorities in Chinhoyi yesterday, Minister Mliswa-Chikoka said the province should fully explore the twinning arrangements.

“We signed twinning agreements with Jiansu Province in China, Southern Province in Zambia and Kavango East regions in Namibia. All those MoUs must leave our province in a better place. The positive outcomes of these twinning agreements are too numerous to mention.

“For instance, Kavango East has given us 40ha of land to showcase farming. Zambia’s Southern Province is eyeing our horticultural produce while Mash West has its eyes on Zambian cattle,” she said.

She implored the technical committee to come up with innovative ways of benefiting from the agreements.

Minister Mliswa-Chikoka challenged Government workers and local authorities in the province to pull out all the stops and ensure the realisation of Vision 2030.

“Think outside the box. This whole song of resources must end. We need you to start thinking with precision. Am I really serving the people and doing my job over and beyond the call of duty?

“This year, we need to keep our eyes on the ball. Efficiency and effectiveness. We must have our fingers on the pulse. Be like me . . . be nosy. Do not let anything escape your attention. Have WhatsApp groups. Follow-up with your teams,” Minister Mliswa-Chikoka implored the Government and local authority heads.
