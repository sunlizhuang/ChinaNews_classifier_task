It comes after it was revealed Phillips, son of Princess Anne, had appeared in two adverts for a state-owned dairy firm in China - adding to the row over what Harry and Meghan might do next as they seek "financial independence".

It has now emerged that Lady Spencer has also been plugging milk in China.

Endorsing Satine Jersey milk, Earl Spencer's daughter posed in an emerald dress with a cup of tea for a photoshoot at the British Museum.

The 29-year-old model, a first cousin to Princes William and Harry, told Chinese journalists: "The day of the Royal Family usually begins with a cup of milk or a cup of tea."

The Daily Mail reported that Lady Kitty, who is not a member of the royal family, has been plugging the brand Satine, which is sold by Chinese food giant Yili Group.

A press release issued by the milk company referred to her royal connections, saying: "Kitty Spencer, niece of the late Princess Diana, made an authentic English breakfast tea with Jersey milk and shared the story of Jersey milk and the British Royal Family."

It competes against Jersey Cattle Fresh Milk, the product backed by Phillips.

ROYAL LINKS

Phillips, son of Princess Anne, can be seen in an advertisement for the product smiling at the camera and holding a glass of milk.

The 42-year-old appears in front of a large stately home, with the caption reading "British Royal Family member Peter Phillips".

He grew up on his mother’s large estate in Gloucestershire, and boasts of being brought up on Jersey milk from a herd at the property.

Phillips and his Canadian wife Autumn Kelly also raked-in the cash by selling their wedding in 2008 to Hello! Magazine.

He has never had HRH status, and has been scrutinised in the past for how he made his money along with sister Zara.

Last year it was reported that he held meetings to discuss launching a horse-racing private members club in Hong Kong.

The 30-second advert shows Longleat House in Wiltshire in the background complete with a replica of a royal carriage, according to the Daily Mail.

In his advert, which could see him making tens of thousands of pounds, Mr Phillips says: "Bright Dairies has got a fantastic reputation all over China and outside of China as well, for producing high quality dairy products."

QUEEN GRANDSON PLUGGING MILK

Donning a black bow tie and dinner jacket, he is seen peering out of a high window, before a butler approaches him with a bottle of milk on a silver platter.

He then tells viewers: "As children, we used to spend a lot of time down at the dairy. There was a herd of Jersey cattle at Windsor and we were brought up on it.

"And it was always much fuller of flavour, much creamier, than other milks that we had growing up. That has something to do with the way the cows are bred."

The British Museum received a fee for hosting the photoshoot, which it said was "commercially sensitive".

A spokesman said: "The British Museum started its brand licensing programme back in 2016 and has an international programme, with select licensee partners in China, the UK, Europe and North America.

"The press release details the collaboration on this particular product and the role of the British Museum, whereby the design of the packaging for a specific product was inspired by objects in the British Museum’s collection."

There has been no comment from Lady Kitty's agent, from Mr Phillips or from Buckingham Palace.
