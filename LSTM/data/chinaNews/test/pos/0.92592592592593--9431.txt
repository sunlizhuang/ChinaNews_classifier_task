Almost two months after the Lexus UX 300e’s world debut in China, the automaker has released details about the European-spec model.

Lexus’ first battery-electric vehicle will arrive in mainland European markets in the second half of 2020 and in United Kingdom in January 2021. The Lexus UX 300e is powered by a front-mounted electric motor delivering 150 kW (201 HP / 204 PS) and 300 Nm (221 lb-ft) of peak torque.

It ensures a brisk 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) time of 7.5 seconds and a top speed of 160 km/h (99.5 mph). The motor draws electricity from a 54.3 kWh lithium-ion battery located beneath the cabin floor for a lower center of gravity and optimum weight distribution.

Lexus targets a driving range of more than 300 km (186 miles) according to the WLTP test cycle as well as a recharging time of 7 hours using a 6.6 kW on-board charger. Replenishing a depleted battery to 80 percent of its capacity should take 50 minutes using a 50 kW DC fast charging solution.

Lexus says the all-electric UX 300e has been developed for “excellent on-road performance” thanks to a low center of gravity and optimum front/rear weight distribution. The GA-C platform has been further optimized with additional bracing and enhanced shock absorber damping force to match the dynamic changes that come with electrification.

At the same time, Lexus made sure the UX 300e had “one of the quietest cabins in its class” by using additional insulation and suppressing external noises such as wind or gravel that become easier to notice in an EV.

The Lexus UX 300e will offer Lexus Safety System+ as standard, as well as “the latest in connected car technology.” The LexusLink app will allow drivers to check battery charge and driving range or remotely control the climate of the car using their smartphones.
