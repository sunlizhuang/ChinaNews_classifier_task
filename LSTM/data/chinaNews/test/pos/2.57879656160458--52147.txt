SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- San Francisco Mayor London Breed Monday hosted celebrations of the Chinese New Year at City Hall and highlighted her city's global ties.

The event, sponsored by Chinese Chamber of Commerce in San Francisco and Asian Pacific American Heritage Foundation, is an annual tradition hosted for many years by the mayor and other elected officials, supervisors, community leaders and law enforcement officers, to promote the city's cultural diversity.

Calling the celebration "a time-honored tradition" observed in the city on "a momentous occasion," Breed said the attendance of the event by Chinese Consul General in San Francisco Wang Donghua, and consuls general of other countries including the Philippines, Vietnam and South Korea, represented a "partnership that exists between San Francisco and countries throughout the world."

She noted that San Francisco is going to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the sister city relations between the city and China's Shanghai in the Year of the Rat, which began on Jan. 25, 2020.

For his part, Wang underscored the importance of maintaining the friendship between China and the United States, citing the phase-one trade deal signed by the two countries last month to address their differences.

"It's the right direction to normalize the trade and economic cooperation between our two countries," he said.

He pledged to work with San Francisco to bolster its ties with Shanghai and make their partnership a model of cooperation between China and other jurisdictions in the U.S.

Regarding the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, Wang said there should be no reason to overreact or panic.

"We have been communicating and collaborating with the United States and other countries in an open, transparent, and responsible manner," he said.

"By working together more closely, China and the United States can make a great difference in our common efforts to combat the virus," Wang said.

Monday's celebrations featured vivacious performances of traditional Chinese musical instruments, as well as singing and dancing by Chinese American children, and art groups from the Filipino and South Korean communities.
