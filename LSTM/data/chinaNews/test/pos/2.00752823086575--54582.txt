As day one of the Delhi Auto Expo kicks off, petrolheads across the country have been treated to a series of incredible reveals - from new innovations in the EV sector to stunning new concept designs and performance-focused rides aplenty. With new rides being announced to the public every hour, we took a look at the first day’s announcements - here’s what we think you should keep an eye out for.

A magnificent sneak-peek at the future of the XUV series, the Funster concept aims to showcase the flashiest work from the design minds at Mahindra. Powered by four electric motors with a combined output of 308bhp, the Funster is pretty damn quick with a claimed 0-100 kmph time of 5 seconds - living up to its name. Hopefully we’ll see some of these design elements in the upcoming next-gen XUV500 - from the slick wheel arches and headlamps to a truly futuristic front grille.

With roughly 245bhp, 340Nm of torque and a Rs 36 lakh price tag, the RS245 is a performance-oriented variant of the Skoda Octavia that’s sure to bring a smile on your face. The numbers speak for themselves - Skoda claims that the model can fly from 0-100kmph in 6.6 seconds and easily do 250kmph - though you’ll have to be just as quick to grab the keys for these. The brand plans to run the RS245 at a limited run in India, with just 200 cars, so if you’re looking for one of the best four-door rides in the country, you’ll have to pick up the pace.

Tata Sierra Concept

Remember the good old Tata Sierra? The iconic 3-door SUV was a mainstay during the ‘90s until it was finally replaced by the Tata Safari - but it’s returned with an all-electric comeback. The new concept showcased by Tata is based off the ALFA ARC platform - the very same structure that helped the Tata Altroz score 5 stars on the NCAP safety tests earlier this January.

Maruti-Suzuki Futuro-e Concept

The days of critics slamming Indian designers is decidedly past us with this incredible new concept from Maruti Suzuki. Designed and created as a homegrown effort, the vehicle features an interesting marriage between the ruggedness of an SUV and the sleek, sporty rooflines of a coupe - complete with futuristic swivel-seats and a centre console that looks like something you’d find in Tony Stark’s workshop.

The Maruti Suzuki Ignis and KUV100 better watch out - there’s a new player in town. With considerable ground clearance, skid plates and knobby tyres, the HBX seems to be a rugged little compact SUV with a focus on grabbing buyers who like to wander a bit off the beaten path. It’s expected to come with the same, tiny 1.2L petrol engine found in the Tata Tiago though. So let’s hope Tata’s engineers try to push it to perform as well as it looks.

Mercedes-Benz AMG GT 63 S

Just when you thought things couldn’t get cooler for the AMG 63 model, Mercedes-Benz has gone ahead to craft the most brutal, powerful and screamingly fast AMG model available in India. Not only does it look absolutely gorgeous - the biturbo V8 engine packs 639bhp and can drive this beast from 0-100kmph in 3.2 seconds - that’s around the same as the Ferrari 458 Italia.

Great Wall Haval Concept H

Another frontrunner of the Chinese auto invasion, Baoding-based Great Wall Motors aimed high at the Auto Expo with a teaser of its upcoming Haval model - the Concept H. The Haval features aggressive styling with its fang-shaped indicators and sharp lines - coupled with a host of futuristic features such as a hybrid system, driver-focused HUD, facial recognition and a 5G connectivity suite.
