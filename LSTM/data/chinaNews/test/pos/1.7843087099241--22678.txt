Nationwide, more than 2,000 people had been screened for the virus as of Thursday, and 63 patients in 22 states were being investigated Friday because of possible signs of the virus, according to the CDC. Local officials refused to say how many of those patients are in Chicago or in Illinois, but they are trying to identify others who traveled to Wuhan before the two confirmed cases. Still, Arwady and other public health officials said the risk to the general public remains low despite the confirmation of the case.
