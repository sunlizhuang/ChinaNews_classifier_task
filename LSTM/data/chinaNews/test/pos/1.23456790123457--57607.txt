A spokesperson of the cross-Strait affairs office of central China's Hubei Province on Wednesday said compatriots willing to return to Taiwan will receive further assistance.

Xing Junzhi, also deputy director of the provincial office, called on Taiwan authorities to fully consider the feeling of the compatriots in Hubei and their demands and strengthen cross-Strait cooperation to facilitate their travel as soon as possible.

Xing made the remarks after learning that Taiwan authorities refused pending charter planes that are scheduled to send more Taiwan compatriots back to the island on Wednesday and Thursday, citing limited admission capacity.

On Monday, the first batch of 247 compatriots returned to Taiwan from Wuhan aboard a China Eastern Airlines flight.

Currently, about 900 Taiwan compatriots in Hubei applied for transportation assistance and are waiting to return to Taiwan, according to Xing, adding that some of them had traveled to Wuhan for the flight from remote regions.
