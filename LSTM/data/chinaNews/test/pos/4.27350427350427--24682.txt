Chinese New Year holiday! For this very easy stroll we will travel to Yanqing County to visit the valley where we’ll find an ancient interconnected series of cave dwellings. This trip is suitable for children (no pushchairs, though) – it’s very easy, and the sight of the cave dwellings is sure to spark the imagination.

After visiting the caves we'll get an early dinner out in the country before heading for the Longqingxia Ice Festival, where we'll see all the amazing ice sculptures and lanterns – perhaps not quite as amazing as the Harbin Festival, but definitely not as cold!

Cost: ¥500 / ¥450 for members / ¥250 for under 12s)

Please make your booking through our website, and we'll email you all the information you'll need for a fun day out, including contact details for your guide and information about where to meet. Reservations are essential, and making a booking is quick and easy.
