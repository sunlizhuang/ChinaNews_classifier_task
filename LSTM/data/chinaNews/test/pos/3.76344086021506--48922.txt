The Reds negotiated a mammoth 10 games in 32 days at the start of 2020, and have not notched a league goal since in-form forward Marcus Rashford picked up a back injury.

It was clear that reinforcements were needed and, in Nigerian striker Ighalo, we have brought in a character with Premier League experience, a physical style that adds versatility to the attack and, above all, cast-iron levels of personal commitment.

Most fans will remember the 30-year-old from his spell at Watford between 2014 and 2017, where he notched 39 goals in 99 appearances, picking up the Premier League Player of the Month award in December 2015.

But where has the man from Lagos been since? And what has he been up to? Most importantly, what can we expect from Ighalo when he first steps onto the field in a United shirt?
