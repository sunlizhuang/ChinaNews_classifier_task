HOUSTON, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- A reception was held Thursday to celebrate a Chinese photograph and calligraphy exhibition in Houston, the fourth largest city of the United States.

The exhibition, named "Flower and Bird Collection," consists of 35 photographs with ancient Chinese poems carefully chosen to represent the artistic conception of the pictures. The poems were written in traditional Chinese calligraphy together with English translation. The photographer, calligrapher, translator and the person who selected the poems are all from Shenzhen, China.

Jointly hosted by the Houston Public Library and Houston Shenzhen Sister City Association, the exhibition started in December 2019 and will continue until March 1 in the library.

Audrey Duan, president of the Houston Shenzhen Sister City Association, said that the combination of photos, ancient poems and calligraphy is a "culture meal" of all colors and fragrances.

Zheng Wen, Chinese consul for cultural affairs in Houston, said at the reception that the exhibition is a window to Chinese people and culture.

"I hope there will be more and more such events to build a strong link between Shenzhen and Houston, especially on culture," he said.

Laurie Covington, deputy assistant director of the Houston Public Library, said it is an honor for the library to host such an exhibition, presenting the Chinese culture to the diversified city of Houston.

"Houston Public Library is honored to host this exhibition in gratitude of the rich diversity of our city," she said, adding "we look forward to sharing these works of Chinese poetry, photography, painting, culture with all our communities across the city of Houston."

At the reception, the Houston Shenzhen Sister City Association also donated books about Shenzhen to the Houston Public Library.

Shenzhen and Houston established a sister city relationship in 1986. Since then, various economic, educational, social and cultural activities and exchanges have helped strengthen their friendship.
