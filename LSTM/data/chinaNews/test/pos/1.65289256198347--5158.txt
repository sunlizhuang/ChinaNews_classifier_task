China has officially declared Kiribati as a tourist destination for Chinese citizens.

Director of the Department of North American and Oceania Affairs of Chinese Foreign Ministry, Lu Kang, told the Global Times newspaper he had heard that Kiribati is very attractive because it owns the best diving areas in the world.

Kang added, it is also the world’s only nation whose territory lies within all four of the earth’s hemispheres.

China and Kiribati reached an important consensus during President Maamau’s recent visit to China.

The leaders of the two countries will encourage more Chinese citizens to visit Kiribati and other Pacific island countries.
