KUALA LUMPUR: No novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) case has been detected in Ipoh, Perak as viral on the social media, said Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah.

He said the viral message, which claimed that a student, who had returned to Malaysia from Wuhan, China, had been admitted to the Raja Permaisuri Bainun Hospital in Ipoh after being tested positive for 2019-nCoV, was not true.

The IMR lab test showed negative result for 2019-nCoV, he added.

"I would like to advise netizens on social media not to spread false or unverified news," he said in a post today on his Facebook page. â€“ BERNAMA
