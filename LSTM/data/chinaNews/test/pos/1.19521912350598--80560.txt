"The human connection is what people crave. Loneliness is a funny thing – I've had people call just to say hello."

Singaporeans have long prided themselves on their clean, safe and well-run city. It's part of the social compact – the government keeps things nice and everyone plays by the rules. It is an open market but one that is very carefully managed and this has never been more apparent than in the last few weeks.

Every day the Ministry of Health issues extraordinarily detailed summaries of the state of play: how many cases and which clusters they are linked to. So far Singapore has recorded no deaths; 50 confirmed cases are in hospital and 34 people recovered.

Contacts are also tracked and quarantined and by mid this week, the government had identified 2593 close contacts.

This level of tracking is possible partly because those Singaporeans who are still on the streets, as well as submitting to temperature testing that has now become routine, also provide mobile numbers and proof of ID several times a day – even to just use an ATM.

The operators of buildings where people gather – office blocks, shopping malls – are obliged to have isolation rooms set aside. If your temperature reading on entry is above 37.5 degrees, you will be quietly but firmly escorted to this room. There, your temperature will be taken again. If it is still above 37.5 degrees, an ambulance will be called.

Schools have changed roll-call procedures. Now, it's not enough to just be present, students also have to attest to the fact their parent took their temperature before they arrived and it was normal. If not, they will be sent home.

Last weekend, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore took the extraordinary step of suspending all public masses "until there is greater clarity on the way forward". The Church had considered mandatory compulsory taking of temperature but concluded that precaution may "not entirely help prevent the spread of this infection".

Sajni Gill runs several food retail businesses in the city. Business has dropped off a cliff at one of these, CandyLicious, that was a favourite of Chinese tourists before Singapore barred entry to all Chinese nationals. To keep from cutting jobs altogether, some store staff are now taking one day of unpaid leave a week.

Like many, Ms Gill is keen for life to get back to normal. But she has no complaints about the government's actions.

"We know the government will keep us safe. This is what I tell my friends who have decided to take their family off to live in Europe or the UK until the crisis is over. I tell them,'you would be better off here'."
