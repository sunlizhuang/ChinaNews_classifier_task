This coming 25 January 2020 marks the start of another year, and whether Chinese or Filipino, families celebrate this important event which is considered as a special non-working holiday. One of the most important things to do is to prepare one’s home for the upcoming year of the Metal Rat. And to welcome into our home a fresh new chi (energy) and good luck, here are some of the relevant things we need to do.

Spring cleaning

This will start on the 11th of January. Try to look at every nook or corner of your home including cupboards, refrigerator, drawers and the top of your cabinets to sweep dust and remove the stale energy of the past year. This is a also a good time to throw out old newspapers, magazines, plastic ware that are disposable and other things that are never to be used again. While cleaning, keep a lookout for parts of your homes that need repairs, such as broken cabinet covers or leaking faucets. It is important to know that any leaking faucet means “loss of money” or “unnecessary expenses to occur.”

After completing the repairs and cleaning your home, the next move is to rearrange your furniture, tables, chairs and other house fixtures. Damaged sofa sets should be replaced or repaired.

Another important thing to remember is that your dining table represents the Rice Bowl of the family; it should always be in good condition.

Now we move to our resting place, the bedroom. The condition of your bed plays an important role in how the year will turn out for you. There are things that will affect your new year. If your bed is broken or damaged, this will bring obstacles in your life. If the bed frame is broken, relationships may be affected, especially that of the husband and wife. Better fix it ahead.

Another important aspect is the cutlery, as well as the plates, cups and bowls used as serving dishes. Be sure that these have no cracks on the side. There is a saying that any bad thing that happened in the preceding year will be left behind if you throw broken or cracked items away. Remember that using damaged plates or broken drinking glass and utensils is not good. This will affect your progress and your wealth.

Be sure to clean your cupboards, clothes drawers and even shoe racks. Try to consider giving or donating old clothes that you have not worn for so many years. Cleaning your cabinet and drawer does not only remove bad luck, it also allows for new things to come into your life.

Cleaning your home altar

Dust your altar on the 15, 19 or until 24 of January in preparation for the Chinese New Year.

Replenishing your kitchen

The kitchen is the most important part of your home; this is the place where the food is prepared and cooked which keeps the family intact. You must ensure that it is well stocked with food supplies. Clean your rice urn or banga (where you keep the stock of rice) and fill at least 3/4 full of rice. Then prepare all the food you will serve during the Chinese New Year.

Remember that you cannot use any sharp object such as knife; it will cut your luck.
