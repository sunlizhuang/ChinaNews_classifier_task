Wolf Creek Public Schools has postponed its student exchange trip to China due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Students from grades 8 to 12 from nine schools were to visit Guangdong povince in March.

“It is unfortunate that we have had to postpone this tremendous learning opportunity for Wolf Creek students, but the safety of students and staff is paramount. The impact of the coronavirus in China is serious, and we have to take the appropriate steps to ensure student safety,” said division superintendent Jayson Lovell.

The district says it monitored the situation closely over the past week, gathering information from the World Health Organization and the federal government.

Wolf Creek Public Schools said it plans to continue its partnership with Liwan Education Bureau with the hope of offering another learning opportunity for student travel to China in the future.

“We have developed an international friendship with colleagues, and between Wolf Creek families and families in China. Our thoughts are with them and all those affected by the virus,” said Lovell.
