Donald Trump has said he is "looking forward" to striking a new trade deal with Britain as he branded Boris Johnson a "wonderful" prime minister.

Addressing the World Economic Forum today in Davos, he said: "We look forward to negotiating a tremendous new deal with the UK.

"They have a wonderful new prime minister who very much wants to make a deal, as they say."

Downing Street will be hoping to secure a fresh agreement with the United States following Brexit and the US president's comments allude to such a plan being a possibility.

Britain is set to depart from the European Union, allowing it to diverge in trade agreements from the bloc, on January 31.

Previously, the UK and US have said "extensive preparations" have been made. The nations are free to negotiate upon Britain's departure from the bloc and the timing of the US presidential election means that a deal in the summer of 2020 could be Mr Trump's goal.

His praise of Mr Johnson was not his only moment of being gregarious with comments towards a fellow leader - as he also spoke of his "love" for China's Xi Jinping.

"Xi is for China, I'm for the United States. Other than that we love each other," he said.

Touting his desire for fresh trade deals including that being negotiated with China he claimed to have stood up to "predatory practices" from the nation.

Despite stating tariffs placed on China would likely remain in place as negotiations continue he added: "Our relationship with China right now has probably never been better".

The US president used the majority of his speech to trumpet his work in office - hitting out at his predecessor who he accused of leaving "wreckage".

"Today I'm proud to declare the United States is in the midst of an economic boom, the likes of which the world has never seen before," he told the audience in Switzerland.

He went on to declare: "The American dream is back bigger, better and stronger than ever before."

The US leader also touted the nation as an example to other countries, while he called on nations to "free" citizens from "the crushing weight of bureaucracy".

He claimed his agenda decisions are all focused on "improving the lives" of workers.

Elsewhere in his speech he appeared to hit out at climate change activists, as teen protester Greta Thunberg looked on, stating that: "To embrace the possibilities of tomorrow we must reject reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse."

"They are the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers... and they want to see us do badly but we don't let that happen."

The White House has not named any of the business leaders the US president is set to meet with during his time in Davos.

However, he is scheduled to hold talks Tuesday and Wednesday with the leaders of Iraq, Pakistan, Switzerland and Iraq's self-governing Kurdish region, as well as the forum's founder.

He will also have his first meeting with the new European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.
