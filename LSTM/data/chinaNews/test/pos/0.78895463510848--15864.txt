Huawei's sensational P30 Pro is now on sale at a much more attractive price. This flagship phone has been reduced by all the big retailers meaning you can now pop one in your pocket for under £700. That's quite a drop from when it first went on sale with early adopters being forced to pay £899 to own one.

As a quick reminder, the P30 Pro is packed with features that include a 6.5-inch OLED curved display, quad rear camera and a huge 4,200mAh battery. There’s also a fast processor tucked under the glass and aluminium body and you'll find the clever reverse wireless charging feature which can refill other devices when placed on top of the P30 Pro.

Huawei P30 Pro price drop

READ MORE Huawei is paying fans to get a Mate 30 Pro: is a UK release imminent? This is clearly a good price for this phone but is now a really bad time to buy one? Huawei recently revealed it will be holding a major event in March with the firm's CEO Richard Yu confirming this release date ahead of any official invitations being sent to journalists. The Chinese firm will use this keynote in Paris to release its P40 Pro and if all the rumours are true it could totally eclipse the current P30 Pro. It's thought this new flagship will almost certainly get a faster processor, improved display and bigger battery but the most exciting change could come to its camera. We’d already heard the device is expected to boast a new rectangular camera system which could allow users to shoot images with an incredible 10x optical zoom.
