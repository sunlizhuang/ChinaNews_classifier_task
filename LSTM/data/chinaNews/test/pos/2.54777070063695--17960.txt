Chinese New Year which, is also known as the Spring Festival, officially begins on 25 January 2020 and celebrations end on 4 February. The date is calculated according to the traditional Chinese Lunar calendar and it is therefore also known as the Lunar New Year.

The Spring Festival was originally a ceremonial day on which to pray to gods for a good planting and harvest season. People also honoured their ancestors on the day.

Even though China has moved to the Gregorian calendar, days like the Winter Solstice are still celebrated and many people still calculate their birthdays and ages according to the lunar calendar.

According to the Chinese zodiac, each year in a repeating 12-year cycle is represented by an animal and its associated attributes. The Rat is the first animal in the zodiac and 2020 is a Rat year. It is predicted to be a lucky year and Rat years represent new beginnings, diligence, kindness and generosity. Previous Rat years were 1912, 1924, 1936, 1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996, 2008.

The most fireworks in the world are set off during Chinese New Year’s celebrations. The firecrackers are supposed to scare off monsters and bad luck, as well as welcome in the new year and good luck.

Many Chinese cities have banned fireworks for safety reasons and air pollution concerns, with more than 500 cities imposing restrictions, but people ignore them. Beijing, which had banned fireworks for 13 years, lifted the ban in 2006 due to public pressure.

The most important part of Chinese New Year is being with your family. Everyone is expected to go home for the New Year’s Eve dinner. As most elderly parents live in rural villages while their children work in the cities, this has resulted in one of the largest annual mass human migrations in the world with millions of people travelling great distances to reunite with their families.

Having children and passing down the family name are important aspects of Chinese culture, so desperate singles resort to hiring fake boyfriends or girlfriends to take home. Young people who can’t or don’t want to go home, rent themselves out.

As no showering, cleaning or throwing out garbage is allowed on New Year’s Day to make sure you don’t wash away the incoming good luck, there’s a day before the Spring Festival that is dedicated to cleaning when old bad luck can be swept away to make space for the new good luck.

You are also not allowed to cut your hair; use scissors, knives and other sharp things; argue, swear or say unlucky words like “death” and “sickness”; or break things.

In many cultures children receive gifts on holidays, but in addition to gifts, Chinese children receive lucky money in red envelopes called red packets or pockets. This money is meant to help transfer good fortune from the elders to the children. They can also be given between bosses and employees, co-workers and friends. Everything is decorated in red for Chinese New Year as it symbolizes good luck and joy.

The Chinese Lantern Festival marks the last day of the Chinese New Year celebrations and the first full moon of the new year. It falls on the fifteenth day of the first month of the lunar calendar, usually in February or early March on the Gregorian calendar. This year it falls on 8 February, but preparations begin on the 5th. It is celebrated across the world with lantern displays.
