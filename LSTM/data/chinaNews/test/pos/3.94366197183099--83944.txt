Pōneke's Mermaidens have announced a multi-stage outdoor extravaganza for March, celebrating eight years together as a group. The team of Gussie Larkin, Lily West and Abe Hollingsworth's cheekily titled Mermgrown Festival offers a thrillingly diverse alternative to its namesake Homegrown in the lineup department, boasting a stacked bill of should-be-household-names including Kane Strang (solo), Womb, Big Flip the Massive, Ana Te Kōtiro, Motte, Ludus and even more. There'll also be an art market, stylish merch to cop, and lots of delish food and drinks to enjoy – head along to the first instalment of Mermgrown this March, with 40% of profits being donated to Wellington Rape Crisis...

Press release:

Mermgrown is a one-day outdoor festival dreamt up by Mermaidens to celebrate 8 years playing together! This is our last gig for a while, so we've invited some good friends to join the party.

From Kane Strang, who we shared the stage with at Chick's Hotel for one of our first gigs - to WOMB, who bravely let us take over their parents garage to jam in when we were a lil baby band.

40% of profits will be donated to Wellington Rape Crisis.
