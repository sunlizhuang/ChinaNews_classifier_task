Seafood exports from Norway to China are steadily growing. In 2019, the volume of exports reached 168,503 tons, a year-on-year increase of 13 percent, according to the Norwegian Seafood Council.

TROMSO, Norway, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- Responding to growing demand from upmarket customers in China, and also in light of the approaching traditional Chinese Spring Festival, the Norwegian Seafood Council (NSC) is ready to boost export to the Asian country and enhance communication with Chinese customers, the NSC's China Director Victoria Braathen told Xinhua on Wednesday.

The NSC is the approval authority for Norway's seafood exporters, and it also acts as an advisor for the country's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries.

"China is a traditional market for seafood. In fact, we have already taken diverse measures during the holiday season to promote our products," Braathen said.

"Through investments and long-term partnerships, Norway has a solid reputation as a seafood nation in China," she said.

Seafood exports from Norway to China are steadily growing. In 2019, the volume of exports reached 168,503 tons, a year-on-year increase of 13 percent, according to the NSC.

The value of annual seafood exports to China was 5.2 billion Norwegian krone (1 Norwegian krone = 0.10 U.S. dollar) a year-on-year increase of 40 percent, confirming China as the largest growth market for Norwegian seafood last year, the figures showed.

Since 2014, when the whitefish industry sector and the NSC launched a marketing strategy for Norwegian cod in China, cod consumption there has increased by 500 percent, a new study conducted by the NSC showed.

Last year saw an increasing presence of Norwegian Arctic cod on the Chinese market. Sales increased by 14 percent in volume and 24 percent in value year-on-year.

"While China has traditionally been, and still is, a market for processing and exporting cod, the five-fold growth shows the potential for further development in consumption of Norwegian cod in China," Braathen said.

According to the new study, Chinese consumers' increasing focus on health and nutrition offers new opportunities. The study shows that Chinese consumers consider cod a healthy product, and that there is a marked demand there for Norwegian cod.

The study also reveals that about 50 percent of Norwegian cod exported to China ends up in restaurants, 25 percent in supermarkets, and 25 percent is sold online.

"Annual figures for 2019 show the growing appetite for Norwegian seafood in China. In the new year we will further expand our approach in the China market and we look forward to further strengthening communication with Chinese consumers," Braathen said.■
