Whatever your idea of romance - casually sharing a cheesy fondue or gazing into each other's eyes in an intimate restaurant - there's something for everyone on Valentine's Day.

And it isn't just one day any more with some Nottingham restaurants extending celebrations over several days.

If you've yet to book, you'd better be sharpish as tables are filling up fast.

Paris Bar & Restaurant

It doesn't get any more romantic than Paris - but if you can't afford to whisk your loved one away on a romantic trip to the City of Love, the Nottingham restaurant is the next best thing, kind of.

There's limited availability and the night is almost fully booked but there are still tables available early evening. Reserve a table for two and indulge in a specially crafted four-course evening menu for £39.95 per person with dishes of honey roast duck leg, smoked haddock and rump of lamb.

There's space at lunchtime too when the usual à la carte menu will be served.

Location: High Pavement, Lace Market

Delilah Fine Foods

For an evening of casual, romantic dining, Delilah fits the bill. Lovebirds will begin with a complimentary glass of prosecco in the lovely surroundings of the Grade II listed building.

Sharing platters with cheese, charcuterie and antipasti are on the special Valentine's menu. Or get gooey over a melted cheese fondue with bread and crudités.

An array of seductive sweet treats will round off the evening, amongst them a warmed chocolate and raspberry brownie, Portuguese custard tart, and affogato.

The cosy, intimate surroundings of the recently-opened tapas restaurant make it the ideal setting for a romantic soirée. Head down the steps, below street level, to the rustic-style eatery that feels cut off from the rest of the world.

Pretend you're in Barcelona while savouring a mouth-watering menu of authentic Spanish tapas such as meatballs and tiger king prawns with garlic and white wine and drinking Rioja.

Cosmo

It's not intimate and it's not candlelit but the all-you-can-eat buffet restaurant has gone all out with a grand romantic gesture. This year couples can share a heart-shaped pizza. There's nothing to stop you having one each but leave space for the Chinese, Indian, Japanese and other global cuisine. And don't forget the chocolate fountain.

The special wood-fired pizzas are already on sale and will be available until February 14. Choose from margherita, pepperoni or vegetable.

Marco Pierre White Steakhouse Bar & Grill

Celebrity chef Marco Pierre White has put in place a special £60-a-head menu at the Nottingham restaurant for a Valentine's celebration spanning February 13 to 17.

The three-course menu features delectable sharing dishes including fritto misto to start, 28-day aged Chateaubriand, and a trio of desserts.

There's a little added treat in the way of 2-4-1 on French Martini cocktails.

Location: Wollaton Street, Nottingham

Turtle Bay

The Caribbean restaurant is injecting some light-hearted fun into Valentine's Day by inviting everyone to celebrate One Love on February 14.

Anyone heading to Turtle Bay can enjoy dinner with bottomless drinks and non-stop reggae beats - the perfect antidote to candle-lit cringe.

The evening will celebrate love in all its forms, not just the romantic kind, so let your hair down with anyone you adore... best pal, boyfriend, girlfriend, gran or the whole squad.

For £35 per person tuck into jerk chicken, goat curry or veggie and vegan dishes such the Vegan MotherClucker burger plus unlimited drinks from the tropical rum cocktail collection.

Location: The Cornerhouse, Trinity Square, Nottingham
