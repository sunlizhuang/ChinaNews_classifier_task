Dr. Alan Meltzer Speaks on Dental Implants at the Dentium World Symposium Their design also optimizes the bone-to-implant contact for more predictable and safer immediate loading of single and full arch restorations.

Dr. Alan Meltzer, a board-certified periodontist in Voorhees Township, NJ, recently spoke on the latest advancements in dental implants at the Dentium World Symposium in Guangzhou, China. Dr. Meltzer routinely travels to lecture at events and symposiums around the world in addition to offering periodontal and dental implant solutions at his practice, Advanced Oral Specialty Group. With over 35 years of experience, Dr. Meltzer has placed over 25,000 dental implants and completed over 1,000 full mouth dental implant cases.

The two-day Dentium World Symposium, held in November, had over 1,500 clinicians in attendance and focused on new techniques and digital innovation in implantology for predictable and effective dental implant treatment. Dr. Meltzer’s lecture, titled “The Use of the SuperLine Implant in Challenging Situations: Full Arch and Single Tooth Immediate Restorations”, discussed the advantages of using advanced techniques and technologies in complex implant cases to improve long-term results.

The unique double-thread, tapered SuperLine dental implants improve initial stability after surgical placement in the bone. Their design also optimizes the bone-to-implant contact for more predictable and safer immediate loading of single and full arch restorations. These dental implants can offer better performance and long-term results for more challenging cases, improving recovery, implant strength and stability, and overall success of treatment.

Dr. Alan Meltzer and his associate, board-certified periodontist, Dr. Mina Ebrahimi, are experienced in comprehensive dental implant treatment for patients with challenging situations who require such solutions as SuperLine implant systems. The two periodontists offer the full scope of periodontal treatments and implant dentistry, including gum disease treatment, periodontal plastic surgery, same-day dental implants, and full mouth dental implant solutions. In their state-of-the-art facility in Voorhees Township, NJ, the periodontists use cutting-edge technology, including dental lasers, CBCT scanning, Navident guided surgery, and anesthesia options to provide virtually painless, predictable, and long-lasting treatments.
