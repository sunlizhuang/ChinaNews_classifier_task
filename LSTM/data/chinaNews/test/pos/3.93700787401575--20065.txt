In Shanghai Noon, Chinese martial arts legend Jackie Chan plays bumbling Chon Wang, who works as an Imperial guard in the Forbidden City. When Princess Pei Pei is taken hostage, Wang pursues her captors to the wild frontier land of Nevada, where he meets good-natured thief and occasional cowboy Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). Action, adventure and hilarity ensue in the hit film that spawned an equally successful sequel, Shanghai Knights , also available on STARZPLAY.

Join the Chinese New Year celebrations and explore China’s rich culture and history with a wide range of content that goes from the historical to the fantastical, only on STARZPLAY, the leading SVOD service in the MENA region.

Delve into the world of the fantastical with legendary director Yimou Zhang with The Great Wall. Set in ancient China, the film follows a group of European mercenaries who encounter a secret army that maintains and defends the Great Wall of China against a horde of monstrous creatures. The all-star cast is led by Matt Damon, Jing Tian and Willem Dafoe.

And from director Xiao Feng comes the historical epic The Bombing. Set during World War II, five different Chinese people fight their way through Japanese Air Force attacks to protect an important military machine in Chongqing, 1940. The Chinese-produced blockbuster stars Bruce Willis, Ye Lieu and Seung-heon Song.

And because STARZPLAY is the go-to choice for viewers of all ages, children can join in the Chinese New Year’s celebration by being introduced to one of China’s national, and most famous, animals: the giant panda, with the Disney Nature’s documentary Born in China, which makes for perfect viewing for the entire family.

And speaking of pandas, everyone’s favourite cuddly (and unlikely) hero, Po, is there with another round of funny adventures in the animated hit Kung Fu Panda 3, where he must face two hugely epic, but different threats: one supernatural and the other a little closer to home. And if one movie is not enough to get your Po dose, don’t miss out on his continuing adventures in the animated series Legends of Awesomeness, with both seasons currently available on STARZPLAY in English and Arabic.

Available in 20 countries across the Middle East, North Africa and Pakistan, with more than 10,000 hours of content including premium movies, exclusive and Arabic series, STARZPLAY has also secured its place as the number one player in the MENA region.
