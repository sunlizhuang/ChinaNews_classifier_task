She added: "The Prime Minister and President agreed on the importance of the UK-China relationship and resolved to work together across a range of issues including strengthening the economic partnership, to benefit the people of both China and the UK."

Earlier this month, the BBC reported that China had expressed concern to Boris Johnson's father that the prime minister had not sent a personal message of support to Beijing over the outbreak of coronavirus.
