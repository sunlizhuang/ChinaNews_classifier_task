She has won an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and was the world's highest-paid actress in 2017.

And Emma Stone has now been chosen to front Louis Vuitton's new Spring/Summer 2020 womenswear campaign, working with the brand for a third time.

The star, 31, was shot by Collier Schorr in London’s legendary Park Lane Hotel, modelling creative director Nicolas Ghesquière's new clothes, inspired by the Belle Époque era - the 'Golden Age of France' which lasted from 1871 until 1914.

The La La Land actress was photographed alongside Chinese actress Zhong Chuxi and a cast of models.

Emma dons a beige dress with bib detailing at the neck, a pinstriped pair of trousers with an eye-catching jacket and a punk style dress playfully layered over a floral shirt.

As well as the key looks from the upcoming season, the campaign focuses on the latest handbags, including the new Vanity in Monogram and the latest variations for the Dauphine.

The images reflect Collier Schorr’s approach to photography as a 'medium poised between reality and fiction,' Louis Vuitton said.

Emma also appeared in an LV handbag ad in May last year, in March 2018 she also appeared in a campaign shot by the same photographer, Craig McDean.

Schorr had already photographed the Louis Vuitton Spring/Summer 2019 in her trademark style and reprises the idea of a cast of diverse characters caught as they interact in the rooms and corridors of a landmark hotel.

The campaign will debut in the February issues of international magazines.
