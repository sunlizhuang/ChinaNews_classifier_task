Foxconn Technology Group and Heraeus, two leading global technology groups, signed a Memorandum of Understanding for a strategic cooperation. Both companies are committed to shaping the future of 5G technology together.

Foxconn and Heraeus aim to jointly develop new market potential in the field of 5G telecommunications and collaborate to test solutions in order to accelerate the development process. A first area of cooperation will be the shielding of electromagnetic interference (EMI)—a key technology for 5G mobile phones.

“Foxconn and Heraeus share the same vision of bettering people’s lives with advancement and application of technologies,” said Max Chu, Chief Procurement Officer at Foxconn. “We aim to leverage each company’s expertise, innovative ability and constant striving for improvement.”

“With 5G technology we are entering a new era of connectivity,” said Frank Stietz, President of Business Area Electronics at Heraeus. “Strong partnerships like this will help us to jointly develop innovative solutions needed by manufacturers in the upcoming years.”

Prior to the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding, Foxconn and Heraeus have cooperated in jointly exhibiting selected technologies at China International Import Exhibition (CIIE) in Shanghai, China this year.
