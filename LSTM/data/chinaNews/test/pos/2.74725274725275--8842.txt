The new “bottomless brunch” at Mott 32 in Las Vegas is truly dim sum and then some. The wild $58-per-person Sunday brunch, which started on January 12 at the high-end Chinese restaurant inside The Palazzo, begins with an assortment of rarefied dim sum, including excellent har gow made with king prawns and garlic chives. Deeply black bamboo-charcoal buns are sugar-coated and filled with barbecue Iberico pork, and there are South Australian scallop dumplings topped with caviar and gold leaf.

Next comes your choice of unlimited signature items that include seafood, meat, soup, rice, noodles, vegetables, and desserts. Standout options include sesame prawn toast and an ultra-luxurious preparation of barbecue Iberico pork that features shaved black truffles along with scrambled eggs. So, yes, Vegas now has a restaurant with all-you-can-eat Iberico pork and truffles.

This experience is a lot more civilized than a buffet. There’s no need to shove people who are asking too many questions and holding up the line at a carving station. You don’t have to start running when you see a hotel pan filled with premium seafood. You order from your server. You have up to two hours to eat as much as you want. For $35, you can add a “free-flow beverage package” with specialty cocktails, Moët and Chandon Champagne, and a mocktail.
