After nearly two years of trade tiff, the United States and China finally signed the phase one trade agreement on Jan 15 at Washington. Per the deal, the United States will roll back some tariffs and China will in return boost its purchase of U.S. goods and services.

This deal is a boon for American farmers as they are among the hardest hit by the trade war.

China to Purchase Additional Farm Products

The U.S.-China phase one deal includes China’s commitment to buy agricultural products, airplanes, pharmaceuticals, and oil and gas over the next two years, worth at least an additional $200 billion. This is markedly better than China’s baseline purchase of $186 billion in 2017 and would surely spur demand for American farm goods.

Moreover, China is also making changes to its agricultural policy and removing certain health standards that it had introduced to block a variety of American agricultural produce. Additionally, Chinese administration is relaxing licensing, inspection and registration rules that were trade barricades for America. These changes should provide easy access to meat, poultry, pet food, seafood, animal feed, baby formula, dairy and biotech products in the Chinese market.

Looking back, when the trade war started in 2018, agricultural exports to China dropped by about $21 billion. Even after slight easing in 2019, export levels remained far below the 2017 level of $19.5 billion. Now, with the agreement in play, China will have to purchase an additional $12.5 billion and $19.5 billion, respectively, of U.S. agricultural products from the 2017 baseline in 2020 and 2021.

Moreover, as negotiators from both countries continue talks to reach a second phase deal, the Chinese market should open up further and help exports grow.
