Zhang Peng (C) works at the security checkpoint of Shijiazhuang Railway Station in Shijiazhuang, north China's Hebei Province, January 21, 2020. The Spring Festival is the biggest occasion for family reunion across China, but for the family of 6-year-old Zhang Anzhe, reunion opportunities are rare. Zhang's father Zhang Peng is a policeman working at the Shijiazhuang Railway Station police office while his mother Li Qi is a chief conductor on trains between Shijiazhuang and Wuhan. Both parents were so busy during the Spring Festival travel rush period. They have to make use of every bit of time to meet. On Tuesday, they found a chance as Zhang and his father went to the rail platform to meet the mother, right before departure of the train. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the acquaintance of Zhang Anzhe's parents. The father gave a gift to the mother and the family had a precious three-minute reunion.[Xinhua]
