The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday extended thanks to Vietnam and other countries for providing support for China to combat the novel coronavirus epidemic that has hit Wuhan and many nations around the world.

Global Times, a daily tabloid newspaper under the Chinese Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper, reported on the gratitude the same day.

“The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday expressed gratitude to countries, including Russia, Vietnam and those in Africa, for showing their firm support to the Chinese government in combating the novel coronavirus pneumonia and providing medical aid to the epicenter Wuhan,” the Global Times said.

Medical gloves, masks and protective outfits donated by the Vietnamese government arrived in Wuhan on Monday, the newspaper quoted Geng Shuang, spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as saying.

“Our heartfelt thanks go to all those who provided us with sincere support and help,” Geng said.

Vietnam had sent medical supplies and equipment worth US$500,000 to China on a Vietnam Airlines plane earlier on Monday.

On this occasion, the Vietnam Red Cross Society also donated medical supplies worth $100,000 to China.

In related news, Vietnam’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday that ten Vietnamese citizens had been brought back home from Wuhan.

The 30 citizens touched down at Van Don International Airport in Quang Ninh Province, located in northern Vietnam, at 5:04 am on Monday.

They were healthy upon entering Vietnam but they have been taken to quarantine places to monitor their health in the next 14 days, which is the incubation period of the new coronavius, as per regulations on medical care to curb the spread of the pathogen.

The plane has been disinfected and will be grounded for 24 hours to prevent any possible contagion, the ministry noted.

The novel coronavirus first hit Wuhan in Hubei in December 2019.

China’s National Health Commission said on Monday the death toll rose to 908 and there were 3,062 new confirmed infections across mainland China as of Sunday, bringing the total number so far to 40,171, according to Reuters.

The virus has spread to at least 27 countries and territories, infecting over 330 people.

Vietnam has confirmed 14 cases so far, six of whom have been discharged free of the virus from the hospital.
