Asia Society Northern California members and guests gathered in a packed room at the Computer History Museum on January 15, 2020, for a full day conference on The Future of the U.S. and China: Collaboration & Competition.



The program included a series of five panels comprised of 18 speakers who traveled to the Bay Area from Shanghai, Beijing, New York, Washington, Detroit, Los Angeles and San Diego. Speakers included business leaders from the U.S. and China, social entrepreneurs, academics, and a representative from the U.S. Department of State. Panel discussions focused on AI, technology, the economy, trade, scientific exchange and how the U.S. and China will need to pursue a policy framework for a path forward.



China has emerged as a formidable competitor to the United States, not only in trade of U.S. goods and services, but also in the world of artificial intelligence. Fadi Chehadé, Chairman of Chehadé and Company, noted "more firewalls in China will go up in the upcoming years, reducing the flow of goods, ideas, and services." And Anja Manuel, Principal at RiceHadleyGates LLC said "[The U.S.] is building a wall in a space where technology is airborne."



Speakers also addressed fundamental matters, such as the outlook for the U.S.-China bilateral relationship in the upcoming years. Yuen Yuen Ang, Associate Professor from the University of Michigan noted that "China's industrial policy is big, but not strong" - a critique of the lack of innovation in China with concepts such as One Belt, One Road. Other discussions touched on the advantages and disadvantages of decoupling and engagement, the development of autonomous vehicles in the U.S. and China, and intellectual property rights.
