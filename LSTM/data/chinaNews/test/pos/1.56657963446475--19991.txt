Company boasts 25 million users despite only launching 18 months ago

The fastest growing smart phone brand in the world, Realme, has landed in the UAE with ambitious plans to compete with the heavyweights of the industry.

The tech trendy brand, which boasts the motto ‘Dare to leap’, only launched 18 months ago but has already made it into the top seven smartphone brands worldwide, with 25 million users since the company was formed in May 2018.

Josef Wang, president of Realme Middle East and Africa, told Arabian Business: “The big players for the Middle Eastern market, especially the UAE market, I think everyone knows that Apple, Samsung and Huawei are doing very good in this market. But since Realme is officially launched here we also have the confidence to join the competition and gain the heart from the young customers and gain the market volume.”

Realme smartphones are already available in India, South-East Asia, Europe and the Chinese mainland.

The company has launched three products, the Realme X2 Pro – 64MP Quad Camera Full-Speed Flagship (AED1,999); Realme 5 Pro – 48MP Quad Camera SpeedMaster (from AED699); and Realme C2 – Entry-Level King with mega display and mega battery (from AED399).

Wang, who said Realme is the first to bring the combination of 64MP Quad Camera plus 50W SuperVOOC, plus the 90Hz Ultra Smooth Screen to the UAE, added: “For the Realme products we are more focused on the performance, we want to give every young customer the best of tech and performance in a certain price range. That’s our key strategy for the product.

“We are also focused on the design, to deliver a young-focused design, to give more engagement with young customers.”

Realme will also provide after sales assistance for customers, with nine service centres set to open in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Al Ain, Fujairah and Sharjah.

Currently the smartphone is available online at Amazon.com and selected independent retail stores. While Wang revealed further plans to bring further technology to the region including wearable tech, air pods and televisions.

“We don’t have an exclusive store right now, but we are planning for it. Let’s see how fast we can achieve the first Realme store in the Middle East,” he said.

Realme will launch in Saudi Arabia and Iraq later this month.
