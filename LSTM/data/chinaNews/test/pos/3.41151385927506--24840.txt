Giving a rare glimpse into their family life, Vogue Australia's cover star Elsa Pataky has opened up about how she and Chris Hemsworth have chosen to raise their children.

Starring on the cover for the first time with their three kids — India Rose, seven, and twin boys Sasha and Tristan, five — the image is a rare occurrence for the usually private couple.

Pataky, 43, revealed that the effect of the paparazzi on their family was one of the main reasons why she and Hemsworth, 36, decided to leave Hollywood and make Byron Bay their home.

"My daughter started to get scared of photos, actually. So we realised this is not a way to live, because you just become enclosed in a house. I love nature and I love to be outside, and I wanted my kids to have that freedom, so we decided to leave."

The actress admitted that the change in scenery had a big impact on her lifestyle.

"My goal was always, when I have kids, to be in a place that's not the city. I want them to grow up in nature, because I crave that."

She added, "But that step did take me away from one of my big passions in life: acting, and it was a big change. But I changed my life to be a mum, which I think is just the most amazing thing in the world."

She continued, "I wanted to pick my kids up, I wanted to take them to school, I wanted to be part of the school and be involved in what they do."

Despite leaving Hollywood and putting her acting career on the back burner, the Fast Five star told the magazine that she is content and living out her dreams.

"My dream was always to have a farm and horses. When we were trying to find a property, I had to have a place where I could have horses and my kids could be with them and enjoy that, too."

She added, "I feel privileged. If life has given you great things, just enjoy it as much as you can, because you never know what's going to happen next. So at least in those moments of having what I want, I try to make the best of it."
