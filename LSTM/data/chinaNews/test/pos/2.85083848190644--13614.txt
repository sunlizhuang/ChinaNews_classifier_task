In his speech, Zhang Xu said that China and Brunei will implement the important consensus reached by leaders of both sides, jointly run the China-Brunei Year of Tourism 2020, implement the Asia Tourism Promotion Plan, create a new pattern of tourism cooperation, and promote friendship between the two countries.

"With today's event, and with the two countries' strong network initiatives, coupled with Brunei-China Year of Tourism 2020, both countries could further enhance cooperation to increase two-way tourist visits and promote greater people-to-people exchanges between our two countries", Haji Ali said.

The opening event of China-Brunei Year of Tourism 2020 also showcased a variety of cultural performances from the two countries.

According to statistics from Brunei government, China has become one of the top source markets for tourist arrivals for Brunei with a recorded number of 43,000 tourist arrivals (July 2019). In 2018, Brunei saw an increase of 21.1 percent with 65,563 tourist arrivals from China in comparison to 2017 with Chinese tourist arrivals of 54,125.
