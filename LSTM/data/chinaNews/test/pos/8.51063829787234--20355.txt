From the organisers: "Given the coronavirus epidemic, all types of public programs and events on celebration of the Lunar New Year have been cancelled in China. In many European cities, the local Chinese communities have made the same decision.

We, the Chinese community in Hungary, feel obliged to follow suit, so we have decided to postpone the Lunar New Year Festival (scheduled on 1-2 February in Budapest’s Chinatown) until further notice.



We feel deeply sorry for the change in a short notice. And we thank you for your understanding in advance."
