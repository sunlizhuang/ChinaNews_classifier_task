The Straits Times reported that Zhao approached Li to take on a supporting role in the show and he agreed as he thought it was a good part. Li plays Zhang Jingzhong, the father of the male lead, played by Chinese actor Zhang Zhehan.

The show also stars former Taiwanese boyband member Riley Wang and Chinese actress Zhang Ruohan.

Li and Zhao met through friends and have now known each other for over a decade. She reportedly became a big fan of Li’s after watching his earlier shows when she was younger.

The 55-year-old Li rose to fame playing roles in local shows such as The Great Conspiracy, A Mother’s Love and The Unbeatables series. He is signed with Zhao’s management agency, which manages his acting gigs in China.
