Four Indians could not board the second flight after they reported high temperatures, Misri told news agency PTI.

Air India’s jumbo flight made two flights to Wuhan city; first flight brought back 324 people. The plane reached Delhi around 7.30 am on February 1 with the passengers and five doctors from Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital and one paramedical staff on board. The passengers including 3 minors and 211 students underwent thorough medical examination, because of risk of infected people exposing the fellow passengers and flight staff to the CoV.

Six Indians could not board the first flight as they were stopped by the Chinese immigration officials after they reported high temperature.They may be quarantined to undergo tests to determine whether they have symptoms of the coronavirus, officials said.

Twenty-five others stayed back on their accord, Misri said, adding that there may still be about 100 Indians who remained in Hubei province for which Wuhan is the provincial capital.

Ahead of the evacuation operation, the Indian Embassy had informed the Indians that they have to undergo health tests before the flight and undergo 14-day quarantine after reaching India in special camps.

The Indians who were evacuated from Wuhan have been quarantined in a specially prepared facility in Manesar near Delhi, the Indian Army, which has mounted a full-fledged operation for this purpose, said.
