The Women's Federation of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region presented a revised version of the book series titled Beautiful Women â€” Happy Families to local women, which aims to promote family education and improve women's awareness of health in Shule County, Kashgar Prefecture, in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, on January 3.

Amanguli Kasimu was grateful to receive such good and practical books targeting women and said she will recommend the books to her relatives and friends.

Miriguli Abaji said she was filled with unspeakable happiness by reading with children and starting the new year by reading good books.

The original version of the book series, written in both the Uygur and the Chinese languages, was compiled by the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) based on its investigation and research in Xinjiang.

In 2019, the series was revised by the women's federation of the autonomous region with the support of the ACWF and other departments in Xinjiang.

At present, 230,000 volumes have been distributed to grassroots women's organizations and women from different ethnic groups in 14 prefectures and cities throughout the region.

Hairiguli, a villager in Yingjisha County, said that in addition to the Uygur and Chinese languages, another highlight of the upgraded version is the illustrations, which help her better understand the information about women's health.

The Kashgar Women's Federation distributed the books in industrial parks, women's entrepreneurship demonstration bases, reading corners and publication racks at restaurants.

Reading classes and workshops were held in Hotan Prefecture for local women to share the benefits of personal development they had gained from reading, which encouraged women from different ethnic groups to spend more time with books.

Wang Lixia, Secretary of the Leading Party Members' Group of the Women's Federation of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said that the federation will continue to organize diverse activities to encourage more women to read and apply the knowledge gained to their daily lives, thus enhancing their health awareness and improving their lifestyles.
