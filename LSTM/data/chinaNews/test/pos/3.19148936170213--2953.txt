January 6, 2020: December is a good time for Chilean cherries to hit the market. The strong sunlight and fertile volcanic soil of South America provide the perfect conditions for producing exquisite, flavorful and plump cherries with a pleasing color and sweetness. On Christmas Day, a large quantity of Chilean cherries completed their long journey from South America to arrive at the Port of Nansha.

On Dec. 25, Christmas Day in the West, the Nansha Harbor Area of the Port of Nansha saw the arrival of the container ship Lloyd Don Giovanni, the very first cherry express service from Evergreen. The unloading, customs clearance, release and transportation to Jiangnan Fruit Wholesale Market were completed within only 2.5 hours, bringing the freshest Chilean cherries to eager Chinese consumers. This sets the record for the fastest and most cost-effective cherry express service in South China.

To expedite customs clearance and maintain the highest levels of freshness and firmness, Nansha customs applied a special customs clearance mode designed for very delicate fruits such as cherries and permitted advance declaration of the shipment.

The shipment comprised 23 containers of cherries in total, of which six containers (26%) were inspected. For a closer look at the speed of the clearance process, let us examine the timeline:
