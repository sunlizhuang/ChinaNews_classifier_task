CANTON – There’s a new sergeant in town.

Canton Police Officer Ryan Cole recently was promoted as the department’s newest sergeant.

Cole will take over from Sergeant Andrew Dow, whose last official day was Monday, Jan. 20.

Canton Town Clerk Sally Noble swore in Cole as sergeant at the Canton village board meeting Tuesday, Jan. 21.

“It was a delight to interview Ryan,” said Village Trustee Beth Bullock Larrabee prior to the swearing in ceremony. “He has been with the Canton PD for the last 5 years. He is a narcotics investigator. He has been deputized into the St. Lawrence County Drug Task Force. He’s a field training officer and he’s a firearms instructor and he also instructs at the academy at SUNY Canton.”

“One of the things I really appreciated, when he was interviewing, is that he wants to lead by example,” Larrabee said to the board. “He has a really great work ethic. And I’m really excited for him to be a mentor and leader within the department.”

“I would second what Beth said,” said Trustee Anna Sorensen. “He’s very qualified. He comes highly recommended. And he brings a good perspective towards policing our community.”

The board approved the promotion unanimously.

“I just want to say thank you very much to Sgt. Andrew Dow and everything he did in his little over 20 year career,” said Police Chief James Santimaw after the ceremony. “And also thank you to the police committee and the board for approving Sgt. Cole. He’s going to make everyone proud. He’s a really good officer and he’s going to do great things.”

Santimaw told North Country This Week that Dow completed his 20 years with the Canton PD and retired to spend more time with his family and pursue other outside interests. “He was a valuable member of the Canton Police Department who will be missed and never forgotten by those who knew him best,” Santimaw said.
