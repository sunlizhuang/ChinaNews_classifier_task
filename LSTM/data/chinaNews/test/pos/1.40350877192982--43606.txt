KOTA KINABALU: The Sabah government will continue to collaborate with China to facilitate the return of their citizens, says Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal.

The Chief Minister said although the state government had imposed a temporary suspension on all flights from China to Sabah, this was only to stop new arrivals to the state.

"Well, if there is a flight from China or any aircraft, they can come to pick up their people. We won't stop that.

"And vice versa, if there are Malaysians from Sabah in China, who want to return home using a flight from China, we allow that.

"We do not expect them (Sabahans) to stay there if they are allowed to go home," he told reporters after the Putatan division Parti Warisan Sabah Chinese New Year open house at Tanjung Aru town here on Saturday (Feb 1).

He also clarified that Chinese tourists who were already in Sabah and in good health could stay on, provided their visas were still valid.

Earlier in his speech, Shafie said his deputy chief minister, Datuk Christina Liew, would continue to engage with the Chinese government via the necessary channels.

Liew, who is also state Tourism, Culture and Environment Minister, said Sabah Tourism Board was currently liasing with the China Consulate General in Kota Kinabalu, as well as Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), to ease the return of Chinese nationals from the state, estimated to be in the thousands.

She said Beijing had sent an aircraft to Kota Kinabalu to bring over 100 Chinese tourists home on Friday evening. She said they did not foresee any major problems in flying back the rest of the Chinese tourists in stages.
