Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump Friday amid Canada’s push to ratify the new North American trade deal.

Canada is the only country that has yet to approve the trade agreement after President Trump signed the agreement into U.S. law earlier this week. Earlier this week, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland introduced legislation that would implement the deal, officially known as the United-States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement.

In a readout, the Prime Minister’s Office said Trudeau and President Trump discussed the the ratification process in Canada and the United States.

As well, the PM spoke to his U.S. counterpart about the ongoing detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in China.

The detentions of these two Canadians over a year ago were seen as an act of diplomatic hostage-taking for Canada’s arrest of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou. Trudeau has looked to the U.S. for support on securing the release of these two Canadians throughout their detention.

“The Prime Minister thanked the President for the continuing support of the United States in this regard,” the readout said.

It also said two leaders discussed the coronavirus global health emergency and measures being taken by both countries to protect citizens.

Since emerging in Wuhan, China in late December, the novel coronavirus has spread to 19 countries including Canada and the U.S., and has infected about 9,800 patients, according to Chinese and World Health Organization data.
