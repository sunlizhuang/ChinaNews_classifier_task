With the start of a new Lunar New Year on Jan. 25, the Lethbridge Chinese community will be celebrating the new lunar new year on Feb. 1, at the Coast Hotel Convention Centre, with a gala dinner and variety show.

The Southern Alberta Chinese Association, a non-profit society, will host the gala from 5:30 p.m. until 9:30 p.m., with a traditional opening of the Lion Dance.

The Lunar New Year is the Year of the Rat, and in Chinese culture, rats are seen as a sign of wealth and surplus. Because of their reproductive rate, in earlier years married couples pray to them for children. Those born in the Year of the Rat are believed to be clever, quick thinkers and successful, but they are also content to live a quiet and peaceful life.

Tickets for the Southern Alberta Chinese Associationâ€™s New Year Gala on Feb. 1, are $30 for adults, $20 for ages 4-10 and under four are free. To RSVP for the gala, email Jan Gong at jgong22@yahoo.com.
