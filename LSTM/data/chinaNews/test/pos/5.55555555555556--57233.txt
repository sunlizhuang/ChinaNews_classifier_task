The Foreign Trade Center (CCEX) of Lima's Chamber of Commerce stated that they expected China will approve the import of new Peruvian agricultural products in 2020. “The agricultural products that China could approve include pomegranate, Brazil nut, frozen fruit (avocado, mango, and cranberry), bananas, and fresh fruit. This would allow us to expand our export basket and meet the demand of that important market,” said Monica Chavez, the manager of the CCEX.

Peru, through the National Agricultural Health Service (Senasa), has managed this access with the Chinese authorities, with which it has signed a Free Trade Agreement.

In the case of pomegranate, Peru has signed a memorandum of understanding with the competent authorities in China to initiate the entry procedure. "In this case, the objective of the agreement between both markets is to validate the cold treatment that is still under negotiation," said Chavez.

The authorities of Senasa and the General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China (GACC) signed an agreement of sanitary collaboration, which would allow the entry of Brazil nuts, frozen fruit (avocado, mango, and blueberry), bananas, and fresh fruit to the Chinese market.

It should be noted that China is a potential market with more than 1.3 billion consumers. By the end of December 2019, non-traditional agricultural-exports to that destination amounted to 192 million dollars, i.e. 14.93% more than in the previous year, thereby generating a 3.05% share of the non-traditional agricultural sector.
