Growing up I cringed at Asian representation in film and television. More often than not we were cast as nerds, martial artists or second to the plot. We had little depth to our characters, which continuously perpetuated racial stereotypes — stereotypes that still exist today.

I recently binged through new drama series, The Ghost Bride, and as someone with Malaysian–Chinese roots, boy did I become overjoyed with excitement.

The Netflix Original, the first of three original series for the streaming service to be filmed entirely in Mandarin and yet another reason to be excited, is based on the New York Times best-selling novel by the same name, penned by Malaysian writer Yangsze Choo.

The series is also filmed entirely in Malaysia, by two award-winning Malaysian directors, Quek Shio-Chuan and Ho Yuhang, celebrating the country’s diverse landscape as well as its home-grown talents.

The Ghost Bride, set in 1890s Colonial Melaka, follows the story of Li Lan who is offered a proposal to become the ‘ghost bride’ to the deceased son of the wealthy Lim family. Li Lan’s position is financially lucrative, and if she agrees to the marriage, her family will be saved from a lifetime of debt. The catch is however, she will forever be haunted.

Finally, a series I can relate to, starring complex characters, showcasing food I am familiar with and based on a story of historical Chinese culture. Not only that, but it is set and filmed in Malaysia, a country that I have a strong and personal connection to.

The filming locations of The Ghost Bride include Butterworth, which lies along the Perai River estuary, where my mother’s family is from, where my parents met and my second home, and Penang Island, otherwise known as the pearl of the orient, where my sister was born and where my parents had their first apartment before moving to Australia together.

'I still remember the symbolic annihilation I felt growing up and struggling to understand why. I could mildly relate to characters such as Disney’s Mulan and Lucy Liu’s character from Charlie’s Angels simply because they were the only strong female leads of Asian descent on screen – but that was the extent of it.'

I often watch movies and shows filmed in places that I’ve been to only a few times or never at all, and it is harder to connect to, or get excited about those narratives. They’re often set in cities like New York, showcasing tourist spots such as Times Square or Central Park, and audiences have the chance to see how beautiful those places are.

I feel a sense of honour and pride that now the world can see how picturesque and diverse Malaysia is as a country, and that I can use it as a reference point when I tell people where my family is from.

Having a female protagonist in The Ghost Bride is another aspect of series I was thrilled about, as a new study released by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University revealed that although female leads rose from 31 per cent to 40 per cent in the top grossing films of 2019, Asian female characters with speaking roles reverted back to 7 per cent, dropping 3 per cent from the year prior. Female main characters of Asian descent continue to be underrepresented at 5 per cent.

And those figures don’t surprise me. I still remember the symbolic annihilation I felt growing up and struggling to understand why. I could mildly relate to characters such as Disney’s Mulan and Lucy Liu’s character from Charlie’s Angels (pictured) simply because they were the only strong female leads of Asian descent on screen – but that was the extent of it.

It’s still apparent today that there is a lack of Asian representation in film and TV, as I predict many people would struggle to name more than ten actors of Asian descent off the top of their heads.

And if you think about Australian screens specifically, then that number reduces dramatically, despite 10 per cent of Australians having Asian ancestry. Apart from The Family Law, and more recently the web-series Girl, Interpreted there is a severe lack of Asian representation on Australian screens that fails to represent the beauty of our multicultural society.

Where are the Asian families on Home and Away or Neighbours? Should I dare ask where the Indigenous families are? We need these stories to shape the nature of our culture, normalise our differences, and validate our experiences.

I’m glad the times are finally changing on a global scale however, and we’re slowly but surely seeing more Asian representation on screen. And there’s no denying that people love it. Take a look at Parasite (Korean), The Farewell (Chinese) and Crazy Rich Asians (Singaporean) all released within the past couple of years, and all of which were nominated for Golden Globes.

Having this very personal experience firsthand has makes me understand more than ever before how important representation is in the cultural landscape of film and TV, how much we need new narratives in the media, and what it truly means to minority groups. There are so many voices that are yet to be heard, and so many stories still left untold that could be a storyline for the next blockbuster hit.
