Coliman launches banana sea exports

by Tad Thompson | January 30, 2020

Coliman Fresh Produce S.A. De C.V. has launched a Mexican banana export program to China.

Audee Rios, the firm’s international sales director, said Coliman’s new opportunity is the result of a new agreement between Mexico and China.

“There wasn’t a phytosanitary protocol to import bananas from Mexico into China, so it wasn’t allowed until recently," said Rios. "The protocol for bananas was signed back on May 13, 2019 between the Mexican and Chinese governments after years of study and discussion. After that we needed to apply for inspections and audits in all our farms to get officially listed on the Chinese customs. Right now, only 37 farms are allowed to pack bananas in Mexico to export to China, out of which seven belong to Coliman. December 2019 was finally the official date to start after all the process was finished.” Coliman is among the first Mexican banana companies to export to China.

Coliman’s first shipment is due to arrive in Shanghai in mid-February. The receiver is Golden Aurora Fresh Fruit Trading. This new strategic partner will ripen, market and nationally-distribute Coliman bananas to wholesalers and retailers.

Coliman exports bananas in both controlled atmosphere sea containers, and standard reefer containers. The firm ships directly to Shanghai from Mexico’s Pacific port of Manzanillo. It’s a 19-day voyage.

While Shanghai is the first Chinese port to receive its bananas, Rios said, “we are studying Qingdao, Dalian, among other ports for the future.”

China’s organic food market is estimated to reach more than $13 billion by the end of 2024. “It is hoped that alongside Golden Aurora, Coliman can begin exporting organics alongside conventional bananas later in the year,” Rios said.

Coliman Fresh Produce is based in Hermosillo, Sonora. The large firm has a wide growing and shipping network across Mexico. Rios said Coliman’s first export experience began with mangos in the 1970s. The firm started exporting avocados in 1997 and first exported bananas to the U.S. in 2005.

The firm has been shipping avocados to China. Rios said Chinese phytosanitary allowances permit only certain fresh products to be exported from Mexico to China. So for now Coliman will limit its Chinese export program to bananas and avocados.

Coliman has other Asian customers in Japan, South Korea and the far east of Russia. Overall, she said, “Our export programs are still growing every year, especially to Asia.”

Coliman also serves Mexican markets. “Thirty-two percent of our production goes to North America,” Rios said.

The company said that through both organic and Fairtrade certifications, “Coliman follows strict agricultural practices that help foster, restore and maintain a healthy ecological balance of the soil and land. To date, educational, health, community and environmental initiatives funded by Fairtrade premiums have benefited thousands of collaborators in and around the region of Colima. Coliman's commitment to organic farming comes from the heart and a core belief that the impact we all have on others and our planet is of the utmost importance. Continuous investment in facilities, infrastructure and integrated supply chains puts Coliman as one of Latin America's leading producers worldwide.”
