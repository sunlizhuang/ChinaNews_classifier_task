BANGKOK — Whether you’re into snacking on deep fried pork while watching Chinese acrobats and lion dances, sipping on craft cocktails in your bespoke qipao, or cheering to teen girl idols, there’s something for everyone in Bangkok for Chinese New Year this Saturday.

Chinatown

Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn tours the Chinese New Year event on Yaowarat Road on Feb. 5, 2018.

The headlining event nationwide will be along Yaowarat Road in Bangkok’s Chinatown. Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn is due to visit the road on Saturday to celebrate the New Year, joined by Thai and Chinese officials.

Fans of Chinese series “The Untamed” will also have a chance to meet the actors in person.

Famed Chinese artist Han Meilin will perform his calligraphy skills onstage and draw auspicious inscriptions, while food vendors will take the street to serve Chinese and Thai dishes.

The event will take place from Jan. 25 to 26 on Yaowarat Road.
