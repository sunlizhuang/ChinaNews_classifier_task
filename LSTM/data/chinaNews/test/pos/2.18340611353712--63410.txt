The Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade, Senator Kamina Johnson Smith, has indicated that the Government will not be able to presently bring home the Jamaicans from Wuhan in China, the epicentre of the feared coronavirus outbreak.

The announcement comes one week after Johnson Smith had moved to assure Jamaicans in the Far Eastern nation that the Administration was exploring the possibility of bringing them home.

In a voice note to her fellow Jamaicans then, Johnson Smith stated that it would have been a difficult undertaking, if it was at all possible.

In statement on Friday, the minister said the Government took the decision not to repatriate nationals from China now, based on the advice of public health experts.

Johnson Smith said she had been mandated by the prime minister and Cabinet to explore the possibility of repatriating Jamaican citizens from Wuhan, and had been exploring possible ways to do so.

“I reached out immediately to partner countries which were evacuating their citizens, explored regional partnerships with countries which also have students and teachers there, as well as a sole GOJ (Government of Jamaica) approach by charter of sufficient capacity to cover the distance. Regrettably, none of those options have proved workable,” said Johnson Smith.

“We note that many foreign nationals remain in Wuhan, as several countries which evacuated citizens focussed primarily on government employees, and were also ultimately limited by capacity and other considerations,” Johnson Smith elaborated.

She added that “Through our continued dialogue with relevant MDAs (ministries, departments and agencies), they assessed the risks involved; the current circumstances, including the still unabated dengue and flu season; as well as efforts being made to expand the capacity of the healthcare system to quarantine or isolate persons, based on the natural flow of travel to Jamaica. In that context, they recommended that this avenue not be pursued at this time.”

Johnson Smith said the Government is encouraged by, and continues to give thanks for, reports that to date, all Jamaican citizens in China remain in good health.

Notwithstanding the current assessment, the minister said the Government will continue to monitor the situation in China, and especially in Wuhan.

“We will do all that is possible to support Jamaicans in China even with our small staff in Beijing, along with the support of the Jamaican Association in China and the Chinese authorities through our respective embassies,” she said.

And, she encouraged members of the Jamaican community in China to advise of any challenges with basic needs, “as the Government is assured that where challenges arise, the foreign affairs offices in the respective provinces in China will do their best to assist.”

She also encouraged Jamaicans in provinces where travel is still permitted, to advise their groups or the embassy if they move or leave China, so they can be in the best possible position to help, if needed.
