CANTON Longtime Peoples Services employee and board member Larry P. Kelley has retired after 43 years with the company.

Kelley served as chief financial officer and vice president of finance, in addition to serving on the company’s board.

A second-generation employee, Kelley worked weekends and during the summer while attending Kent State University. After graduating, he became a full-time employee at Peoples, where his father, Paul Kelley, worked 47 years as a driver and foreman.

In another move, Peoples Services announced that Adam Herman has been promoted to treasurer and will serve on the company's board. Herman, a Kent State graduate, joined the company in 2017 and has served as director of financial operations.

Peoples Services traces it roots to 1914 when the company formed in Massillon as a moving and storage business. Ray Sibila, who formed Sibila trucking in 1936, bought Peoples in 1946. The company branched into public storage during the 1960s and incorporated as People Services in 1992.

The Canton-based company operates 45 facilities across seven states, with more than 20 registered FDA food distribution centers.
