The national capital’s main promenade, Rajpath, came alive on Sunday with soldiers from multiple military contingents marching to the beats of brass bands, colourful tableaux highlighting the country’s rich diversity, and battle tanks, state-of-the-art fighter aircrafts and advanced missile systems turning heads at the 71st Republic Day parade as President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief guest Brazil President Jair Bolosonaro and other leaders looked on.

The occasion marks the day when India’s Constitution came into effect, and the country became a republic.

The ceremony commenced with PM Modi paying homage to the fallen soldiers at the newly-built National War Memorial for the first time instead of the Amar Jawan Jyoti beneath the India Gate arch. Modi, wearing traditional kurta-pajama and a jacket, sported a saffron turban on the occasion. This was followed by President Ram Nath Kovind unfurling the tricolour accompanied with a 21-gun salute as the band played the national anthem.
