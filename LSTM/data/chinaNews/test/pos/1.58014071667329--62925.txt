Chinese-American dramedy "The Farewell" had a big day at the Film Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday. Unfortunately, award-winning actress Zhao Shuzhen (who won the supporting actress trophy over nominees including Jennifer Lopez and Octavia Spencer) couldn't be there to celebrate.

According to "Farewell" director Lulu Wang, Chinese actress Shuzhen, who plays Awkwafina's grandmother called "Nai Nai" in the movie, is "stuck in China because of the coronavirus, sadly." With travel bans in place, Shuzhen couldn't collect her supporting actress Spirit Award in person.

Instead, Wang had to accept the award on behalf of her 85-year-old cast member. And then, the director accepted another honor: The Spirit Award for best feature.

Wang, whose movie is semi-autobiographical, used her second time at the microphone to send a message about female filmmakers, and how they don't need to be encouraged to tell stories. They just need opportunities to do so.

"There are lots of women making films and who want to make films and who are in film schools," she said. "What women need is just the job. Give them the freakinâ€™ job. Give them the money."

Wang thanked her own grandmother, her Nai Nai, and apologized to her parents "for putting all of our baggage out there."

"I hope it was worth it," she said.
