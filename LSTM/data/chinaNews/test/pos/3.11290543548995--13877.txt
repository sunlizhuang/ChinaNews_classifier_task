BEIJING, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- China and Myanmar are expected to consolidate and deepen their millennia-old "Paukphaw" (fraternal) friendship as they work together to build a China-Myanmar community with a shared future.

This new chapter in the traditional friendship is being written during Chinese President Xi Jinping's state visit to Myanmar from Friday to Saturday at the invitation of Myanmar President U Win Myint.

"President U Win Myint and I have agreed that my visit shall mark the start of our joint endeavor to build a China-Myanmar community with a shared future," Xi said at a state event held in Nay Pyi Taw Friday to celebrate the 70th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic ties.

Xi said during his talks with Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi on Saturday that the building of a China-Myanmar community with a shared future opened a new era in bilateral relations.

China and Myanmar are close neighbors. In the Myanmar language, "Paukphaw" means siblings from the same mother. It is an apt description of the fraternal sentiments between the two peoples, and has been the driving force and source of strength behind China-Myanmar relations, Chinese analysts said.

Ruan Zongze, executive vice president of the China Institute of International Studies, said the building of a China-Myanmar community with a shared future comes at the right time and has bright prospects.

Ruan said this shared vision is rich in connotation and content, and will boost strategic mutual trust, strengthen mutual benefit and win-win cooperation under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, as well as tighten people-to-people bonds.

The China-Myanmar community with a shared future will ensure the bilateral ties continue on a path where both sides stick together through thick and thin, Ruan said.

Zhai Kun, a professor of international studies at Peking University, pointed out that China's efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind start with its neighbors.

The strengthened China-Myanmar ties will play an exemplary role, Zhai said.

"The building of a China-Myanmar community with a shared future is a significant contribution to the bilateral ties, and to the peaceful development of the region as well as the world," said Ruan.
