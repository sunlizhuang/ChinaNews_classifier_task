Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang's Regular Press Conference on January 20, 2020

2020/01/20

Q: Can you share with us any new details on how China is coordinating with other countries to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus?

A: You may have noted that the Chinese health authorities have released relevant information on the prevention and control of pneumonia outbreak caused by the new coronavirus. You may refer to that.

Here I want to stress that since the outbreak, China has taken proactive measures to handle it in a serious and professional manner. We have worked to formulate strict prevention and control schemes, spared no effort to treat the patients, properly managed close contacts, carried out in-depth epidemiological investigations, released the information on epidemic prevention and control in a timely manner, and launched campaigns to raise awareness of the disease.

At the same time, China has informed the World Health Organization, relevant nations, regional organizations, and its Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions of the outbreak in a timely manner and maintained close communication with them. We have shared with the WHO the information on the genome sequence of the new coronavirus as soon as possible. After receiving notification of cases from relevant countries, China has taken that seriously and stayed in close communication with all parties through bilateral and multilateral channels, while strengthening cooperation with all-out efforts to deal with them.

We hope other countries can immediately inform the Chinese side of suspected imported cases through official channels with a view to better prevention and control. We will work with all parties to jointly tackle the epidemic and safeguard regional and global health security.

Q: Recently, Japan, Thailand and the ROK all reported cases of the infection by new coronavirus. It is the peak season for the Spring Festival travel rush in China, and many people are concerned about it. What measures will China take to prevent the outbreak from spreading around the world?

A: According to what I learned from relevant authorities, Japan, Thailand and the ROK have informed China of confirmed cases of new coronavirus infections. China has maintained close communication and cooperation with these countries on treatment, prevention and control.

As for what measures China will take to prevent the spread of the epidemic, I can tell you that the Wuhan government has taken measures to control the flow of people leaving the city. I would refer you to competent authorities and relevant local governments for more details.

I would like to emphasize once again that after the outbreak of the new coronavirus-caused pneumonia in Wuhan, relevant Chinese authorities have informed the WHO, relevant nations, regional organizations, as well as China's Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions in a timely manner and stayed in close communication with them.

At the same time, relevant departments of the Chinese side have also disclosed information and briefed the public on the developments of the epidemic in a timely manner. We will work with all parties to jointly tackle the epidemic and safeguard regional and global health security.

Q: Russian acting Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested to hold a meeting on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear deal at the level of political directors of the deal's remaining participants' in order to understand the future fate of the agreement. In China's point of view, is there a need to organize this meeting now? Will China attend it?

A: The JCPOA, endorsed by the UN Security Council, is an important outcome of multilateral diplomacy, an important pillar for the international non-proliferation regime and peace and stability in the Middle East, and a significant part of the international order based on international law. It should be upheld and implemented.

Under the current circumstances, we call on all parties to the JCPOA to remain calm and restrained, resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations under the JCPOA Joint Commission, and take concrete measures to restore the balance between rights and obligations in the JCPOA.

As comprehensive strategic partners of coordination for a new era and staunch supporters of the JCPOA, China and Russia have been in close communication with each other on the Iranian nuclear issue. China supports all proposals that will help ameliorate the current situation and preserve the JCPOA.

Q: The extradition hearing for Meng Wanzhou begins today in Canada. The Chinese side has repeatedly called for her release. Is the Chinese side confident that she will receive a fair hearing in Canada?

A: China's position on the Meng Wanzhou case is consistent and clear. The US and Canada abused their bilateral extradition treaty and arbitrarily took compulsory measures against a Chinese citizen without cause. This is entirely a serious political incident that grossly violates the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese citizen.

The Chinese government is steadfast in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens. Once again we urge the Canadian side to take China's position and concerns seriously, release Ms. Meng and ensure her safe return to China at an early date.

Q: The Berlin Conference on Libya was held yesterday in Germany, with representatives of Russia, China, the United States and other countries in attendance. The participants agreed to create an international mechanism to coordinate their follow-up actions, and called for the formation of a united and effective government, resumption of peace talks and holding presidential election in Libya. What's China's comment on the result of the conference?

A: The Berlin Conference on Libya was held in Germany on January 19. Special Representative of President Xi Jinping, Yang Jiechi, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, attended the meeting and expounded on China's position and propositions.

The Conclusions of the Berlin Conference on Libya reflects the global consensus on easing the tension in Libya and seeking a political settlement of the issue.

China always takes an objective and fair stand on the Libya issue, abides by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, respects Libya's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and strives for the political settlement of the Libya issue under the auspices of the UN. China is ready to work with the international community for restoring peace, stability and development in Libya.

Q: You mentioned the Meng Wanzhou case being a political incident and questions about the fairness of the extradition proceedings here. So I'll just ask my question again, does the Chinese government have confidence in a court in Canada to fairly examine these questions?

A: Regarding the case of Meng Wanzhou, China and Canada have stayed in touch with each other. Once again we urge the Canadian side to take concrete measures to correct its wrongdoing, release Ms. Meng and ensure her safe return to China at an early date.

Q: Once again to the coronavirus. Do you have any information as to human-to-human infection at the moment?

A: I would refer you to the competent authorities as this question is a very technical one.

What I can tell you is that China has taken proactive measures to handle the situation, formulated strict prevention and control schemes, spared no effort to treat the patients, properly managed close contacts and carried out in-depth epidemiological investigations. We will work with all parties to jointly safeguard regional and global health security.
