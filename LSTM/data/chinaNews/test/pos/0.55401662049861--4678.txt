Listen to this post:

Amusement parks are supposed to be a place of family fun and enjoyment.

However, there’s one thing you can do that can completely ruin the innocence of a park.

You can take off your clothes.

Zhang, a woman in China, found herself so attractive that she decided to hire a photographer, Xue, for a beauty shoot at the Fengling Children’s Park in Guangxi, China. She arranged for it to be a nude shoot. The only problem?

She didn’t realise that China has strict laws against public nudity.

As according to Mothership, both she and her photographer were arrested, with Zhang being jailed for 5 days for exposing her body while Xue spent 5 days in jail as well for distributing pornographic materials.

Zhang wanted the photos as she felt that she had a good figure and wanted to document her youth. She had taken the pictures on the Ferris wheel, with her and Xue being in two separate carriages.

Besides the arrest, the amusement park management also condemned her actions and stated that they were not aware that the shoot was happening.

For them, not only did the shoot go against the public order and good morals promoted by the China’s General Principles of the Civil Law, it also badly damaged the ‘family-fun atmosphere’ of the park.

We hope the woman learns her lesson, that no matter how good your body may look, you should still keep your clothes on in public.

At least she already got her pictures.
