For the first time ever, award-winning restaurant Yauatcha is bringing its signature fusion of French and Chinese cuisine to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Founded in 2004 in London's iconic Soho district, the Yauatcha brand celebrates authentic Chinese heritage with its unique and diverse menu, offering anything from sumptumous dim sum to its renowned Crispy Duck Salad. By incorporating regional Cantonese cooking techniques, this fine dining chain, newly opened in Riyadh's Al Faisaliah Mall, is all about embracing a fresh take on the cross-cultural dining experience, blending the old with the new, the East with the West.

The in-house and standalone French patisserie is thus an equally important (and delicious) second pillar to the Yauatcha brand. The scrumptious confectionaries form the unique concept of a modern French patisserie, artfully presenting a delectable array of eccentric desserts, from macarons to petits gâteaux and handmade chocolates.

Yauatcha is fundamentally a social space – a modern incarnation of the traditional Chinese teahouse, designed to fuel connections between the people and the environment itself. Yauatcha's latest launch in Riyadh is directly inspired by its flagship space in London, where guests will be privy to the dynamic energy from its open-air kitchens across its two floors, artfully balanced by the tranquility of its peaceful aquariums. A signature palette with ambient hues of blue, pink and green pays homage to the restaurant's reputation for stylish creativity.

With an elegant yet comfortable atmosphere, this contemporary teahouse is no doubt the perfect place for those looking for a glorious, gastronomical adventure, neatly in line with Saudi's sophisticated fine dining palate. In fact, we're booking a table right as we speak.

We'll see you there.

Yauatcha is now open at Al Faisaliah Mall, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Visit yauatcha.sa for more information.
