Chinese New Year 2020 arrives in Liverpool this weekend and there's lots going on in the city centre.

This year there will be a full day of family festivities on Sunday, January 26.

The programme of events including parades and firecracker displays will take place in and around Liverpool's Chinatown, the oldest in Europe, shutting down a lot of the city's streets to make it safe for event-goers.

The regular Chinese New Year dragon and lion parade will start at 11.30am usually outside The Black-e and the unicorn parade is from midday around Nelson Street. The main firecracker and culmination of the parades is from 1pm.



But which roads will be closed? This year's celebrations have been cut back due to council budget cuts, so there will only be road closures on Sunday, January 26.

Obviously the roads around Chinatown will be closed for the celebrations including Great George Street and Berry Street for most of the day.

Here's a complete list to check if you're travelling in and around the area.
