Organisers of this year’s Chinese New Year celebrations say it will be even bigger and better than ever before.

Although Chinese New Year will be officially celebrated this weekend on Saturday, January 25, Perth will be marking the beginning of the year of the rat on Saturday, February 1 and Sunday, February 2.

There will be a spectacular parade through the streets of the city centre on the Saturday, before the celebrations continue at the Riverside light nights on Norie-Miller Walk.

Andy Chan, who is organising the celebrations, said: “It will be the same as last year, but hopefully even bigger and better.

“I was told last year we had the biggest footfall for Chinese New Year in the whole of Scotland - it was the most attended event, and the most attended Riverside light night as well.

“We have a new consul general this year too, Consul General Ma Qiang, and this will be his first visit to Perth, which is very exciting.

“It will be on February 1 and 2, but the official date is January 25.

“We are leaving the year of the pig and going into the year of the rat.

“The rat is the first animal in the zodiac - in the race to see which animal crossed the line first, the rat was clever because he sat on the ox’s head.

“As the ox reached the finish line, the rat jumped off his head and ended up crossing the line first.”

Andy said the celebrations will be “colourful” and “impressive”.

He continued: “In the parade there will be dancers, fire crackers, a Chinese lion, a Chinese dragon and some rickshaws.

“It will be really colourful and bright, so it should be quite impressive.

“The event at the Riverside lights is going on for two days, and there will be Tai Chi, arts and crafts for the kids, projected images and martial arts.

“This year Tai Ko, a big drumming group, and replica terracotta warriors will be there too, so there is a lot happening.

“I am really, really excited about it, I can’t wait. What is really good in Scotland is we have such a close-knit Scottish Chinese community.

“It should be an awesome weekend.”

The Chinese New Year parade will leave from outside 2 High Street at 5pm on Saturday, February 1.

It will travel through St John Street and South Street and onto the Norie-Miller Walk to officially open the themed Riverside light nights.

The Riverside lights at Norie-Miller Walk will be open on both the Saturday and Sunday evenings from 5pm until 9pm, and entry is free.
