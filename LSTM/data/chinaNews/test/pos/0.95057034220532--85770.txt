She's been dubbed 'The Queen of Peak TV'.

But it was her starring role in the latest Universal horror film The Invisible Man that brought out Elisabeth Moss for a stunning red carpet turn on Monday night.

The Mad Men alum, 37, shimmered in a figure-hugging dress for the star-studded premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.

Her minimal makeup consisted of a dab of soft pink lip and heavy eyeliner.

The Invisible Man was written and directed by Australian filmmaker Leigh Whannell (Saw).

The film, adapted from the H.G Wells classic, sees Cecilia's (Moss) abusive ex-boyfriend - scientist Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) - terrorize her after faking his own death and making himself invisible in a lab.

After she's left a large sum of money, she finds herself being stalked by an Invisible Man which she believes to be him.

In real life, the Mad Men alum is very good at 'turning it off' and 'compartmentalizing' her life when on and off-screen.

'I'm really good at turning it off, going home and texting my friends, having a glass of wine, and putting it aside,' Elisabeth said in the February edition of Harper's Bazaar.

'It's not unconscious. I need to be able to do that to treat my work with joy and enthusiasm.'

The Invisible Man is released in cinemas in the UK and US on 28 February 2020.
