A total of 247 Taiwan compatriots aboard a China Eastern Airlines flight departed Wuhan Tianhe International Airport at 9:38 p.m. Monday for Taoyuan International Airport in Taiwan, the Taiwan affairs office of Hubei provincial government said.

Before boarding the plane, the Taiwan passengers received quarantine checks and took protective measures thanks to arrangements jointly made by Tianhe airport and related authorities to ensure their safe return to Taiwan.

The return of a second group of Taiwan compatriots to Taiwan from Hubei is set to take place on Wednesday.
