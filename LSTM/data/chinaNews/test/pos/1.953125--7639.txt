SHANGHAI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan 13, 2020--

Kyriba , the global leader in cloud treasury and finance solutions, announced today that major Chinese clients, including the world’s largest developer of polyurethane, Wanhua Chemical Co., and Didi Chuxing Technology Co., China’s largest cab hailing service, and others are now live on Kyriba’s cloud finance technology network. In just over three years since Kyriba officially launched its business venture in China, the company has hired sales, marketing and product support engineers to meet the growing demand from Chinese companies, and is now seeing double digit growth in the region.

“Wanhua has realized the optimization, integration and automation of end-to-end domestic and international payment processing systems with Kyriba Payments, laying the foundation for the eventual integration of the entire group’s ERP solution,” said Kou Chunpeng, project manager of Wanhua Chemical Global Cloud Financial Platform. “Kyriba’s advanced Currency Risk solutions also help Wanhua more easily adapt to unpredictable economic changes, and supports Wanhua’s overseas growth strategy, while meeting global regulatory standards.”

Wanhua Chemical Group, headquartered in Yantai, is a global leader in the isocyanate industry. It has four production bases in China and Europe and has established subsidiaries and representative offices in more than 10 countries and regions. The company is named as a 2018 Global Top 50 by Chemical and Engineering News.

In addition to Wanhua Chemical and Didi, major domestic corporations and banks have partnered with Kyriba to expand their international footprint and mitigate risk of internationalization, including SUNGROW, HAND, and many others.

“Kyriba is honored to welcome China’s major corporations and banks to partner with Kyriba,” said Jean-Luc Robert, CEO, Kyriba. “Kyriba has the capacity and strategy to help Chinese companies simplify financial management while mitigating exchange rate risks associated with doing business overseas.”
