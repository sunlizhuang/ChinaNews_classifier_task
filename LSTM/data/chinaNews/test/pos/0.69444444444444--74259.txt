A freight train heading to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan departed from Zhengzhou International Hub in Central China's Henan province on Sunday, marking the resumption of China-Europe Railway Express (Zhengzhou) freight train service after the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia.

The train is loaded with 615.8 tons of goods including mechanical equipment, metal products and daily use products.

The operation of the China-Europe freight train signifies Henan province's confidence in winning the fight against NCP and resuming production at a fast pace. It shows the province's determination to build an inland opening-up hub and demonstrates efforts made on integrating into the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, according to local authorities.
