Shenmue III will have familiar elements from its predecessors and new fight mechanics to achieve a new level of interactive storytelling. Our ambition is to deliver a Shenmue experience that will draw in newcomers to the series and reward diehard fans with its deep story and rich gameplay.

Where we left off... Ryo Hazuki has made his way to China in search of his father’s killer. There he meets a new traveling companion, Shenhua, and learns of a legend from her village that has foretold their path together.

The story continues as Ryo and Shenhua start off on a new journey that will take them farther into enemy territory, deeper into mystery, and ever closer to their destiny.

Will the mystery of the mirrors be revealed? How is Ryo’s father connected to all of this? Will Ryo track down the Chi You Men cartel and face Lan Di in a final showdown?

The Battle Rally DLC offers fresh gaming activities in a race unlike any other, as contestants engage in head to head battles whilst racing their way through the course. Furthermore, for the first time in Shenmue III players will have the chance to step into the shoes of another protagonist! In addition to playing the hero of our story Ryo Hazuki, players can also choose the treasure-seeking “Wuying Ren” and making her first appearance in this game, Ryo's sparring partner, "Wei Zhen". Cross the finish line in first place to win some truly awesome items! Battle Rally will be available on January 21, 2020 to purchase individually (£6.490 from the day of release through Sony Store and Epic Game Store. Users who purchased the Complete DLC Collection will see the DLC being available automatically on day of release.

Shenmue III is currently available on PS4 and PC.
