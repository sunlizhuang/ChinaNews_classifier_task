Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist broke the ice with a group of Plymouth-Canton Educational Park high school students Monday morning by revealing that he was "a nerd" in high school, someone who enjoyed dismantling computers before reassembling them.

Gilchrist, who described his job as Michigan's "vice president," then steered the course of the 20-minute meeting on the students' high school experiences, both good and bad.

"I'm here because I want to hear from you," Gilchrist told the students, who were gathered around a table in the Salem High presentation room. "Do you feel like this experience is preparing you for whatever you want to do in the future?"

Like most of his peers at the round table, Edward Cotton IV gave PCEP's unique three-school campus configuration two thumbs up.

"I feel like PCEP is beneficial to my future because of the diversity it offers," said Cotton. "Getting to know people from different cultures and backgrounds is a positive experience. I'm on a medical track, so having different advanced programs like STEM available is beneficial."

Jayla Lowry told Gilchrist that the college campus-like feel of PCEP will help her at the next level of education.

"Attending high school at PCEP is unique because it offers students so many opportunities that aren't offered in school districts across the state," said Lowry. "We have to time manage ourselves because with classes at three different schools, it's almost like going to school on a college campus.

"And if you're struggling in a class, there are math labs and chemistry labs that you can attend to help you better understand whatever it is you're struggling with."

The No. 1 negative about the tri-school setup was something that was out of the school decision-makers' hands, admitted student Madelyn Dunn.

"The weather," she said, sparking laughter from the group. "You have to be prepared for all kinds of weather walking from school to school. I get salt on my shoes, things like that."

Gilchrist, who attended Farmington High School, said he's learned a great deal about the needs and concerns of students, teachers and school administrators throughout his first year as the state's second in command.

"As far as the teachers and paraprofessionals, the ones in the classroom every day, the main thing I hear is they want to feel more support," said Gilchrist. "They feel that every year they're asked to do more with less, which is why Gov. (Gretchen) Whitmer and I are making it a priority to develop programs that will increase their resources.

"School administrators across the state want to know that the state is not going to undercut the initiatives that they have tried to pull forward over the years. I'm also hearing — and I heard here today — about the increasing popularity of vocational programs. The districts' leaders want to know there are going to be enough resources to provide students with enough vocational-focused opportunities."

Teacher-shortage remedies

Gilchrist said he and Whitmer acknowledge the looming teacher shortage and are working on ways to recruit and retain more people to the shrinking pool of educators.

"The No. 1 thing we need to do is restore respect to the teaching profession," Gilchrist noted. "Our administration recognizes the importance and necessity of strong educators."

Gilchrist also asserted that he'd like to see the teaching population better reflect the diversity of the students they guide.
