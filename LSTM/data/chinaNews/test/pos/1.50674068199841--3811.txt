Nutreco is planning to put €20 million into a land-based salmon farm project in China which AKVA group is also backing.

The animal feed giant -- which operates in fish and shrimp via its Skretting subsidiary -- has "pre-committed" €20m in a €60m private placement for Nordic Aqua Partners, which plans to farm 8,000 metric tons of Atlantic salmon by 2026 in a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) on Gaotang Island, close to Ningbo. Undercurrent News first reported on the Nordic Aqua project at the end of 2017, when former Mowi (then Marine Harvest) executive Ragnar Joensen had come onboard.

This would give Nutreco around 25.51% of Nordic Aqua, with other investors, including Akva, having 51.02% and the existing owners left with around 23.47%, according to documents seen by Undercurrent.

Akva, whose RAS technology will be used in the project, is also planning to invest €3.1m in the private placement, which is being run by SpareBank1 Markets. The technology firm announced its participation in the project on Dec. 20, the date the private placement documents from SpareBank are dated. Charoen Pokphand Foods and 8F Investment Partners are also eyeing RAS salmon farms in China.

In addition to the €20m pre-commitment from Nutreco and €3.1m from Akva, another €20m has been lined up. Approximately €5.84m will come from an existing shareholder, Kontrari, a holding company owned by Norwegian shipping magnate Frode Teigen.

Then, €14m has been pre-committed by a consortium guaranteeing for financing, around €250,000 will come from “the core team” of “working chairman” Joensen, CEO Ove Nodland and construction manager Arne Knudsen, and around €300,000 has been pre-committed by another investor that SpareBank didn’t name.

This leaves €16.61m of available equity to new investors to get to €60m, according to a presentation on the project, seen by Undercurrent.

A timeline is given in the document for the private placement. The notice of the conditional allocation took place on Dec. 23, with an extraordinary general meeting for Nordic Aqua set for around Jan. 20 to approve the offer. The payment date is “on or around” Jan. 25, with the registration of the new shares in the company’s register set for Feb. 3.

Skretting and SpareBank declined to comment to Undercurrent. Nodland, CEO of Nordic Aqua, did not respond to a request for comment.

The presentation on the project reveals Nordic Aqua has a “near-term expansion option” to 16,000t and land secured for 40,000t. The 40,000t potential comes from “further on-site expansion & replication potential in other regions”, it states. The location means 100m of China’s richest consumers in Ningbo, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Xiangshan are all easily accessible.

There is additional expansion potential in Beijing and Hong Kong, the presentation states. Nordic Aqua is looking at the 92m people in the greater Beijing area and the 50m in the Hong Kong region as next possible targets, which would then take group production to close to 60,000t, according to the presentation.

The business has a long-term cost advantage through no air freight or import duties, and can also get fish to market in five hours, compared to around 90 hours from traditional farms, according to Nordic Aqua.

The Chinese salmon market, around 110,000t at the moment but growing at 10% annually, pays a premium for freshness and wholesale prices are high, at NOK 100-120/kg. Consumption in China is expected to increase to 200,000t in 2025, Nordic Aqua predicts.

Nordic Aqua expects the 8,000t it plans to farm by 2026 to generate annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of around NOK 374m ($42.4m), based on prices of NOK 46.7 per kilogram and costs of around NOK 23/kg.

The company is looking for €20m in capital, taking the total to €82m. “Certain investors have entered into an underwriting agreement”, guaranteeing for €20m in equity financing, if bank financing cannot be raised at acceptable terms, the company said.

Three-phase plan

Nordic Aqua has a three-phase expansion plan for the RAS facility, with the government lease giving a two year grace period on rent during the build-up phase, prior to cash generation.

The first phase will see the “government provide” a 30,000 square meter facility, with phase two adding 17,000 sq. meters. This will see the company go to 4,000t and then 8,000t in production.

Phase three will add 8,000t more and there is then the option for 24,000t more, with land area of 300,000 sq. meters “zoned for aquaculture”, according to the presentation. The company’s license agreement also has the “option to expand into other species”.

According to a timeline on the presentation, the first stage of the construction will be completed around the end of 2020 and the start of 2021, with the first batch of eggs going into the production facility. The plan is for the first sales at the end of 2022.

Nordic Aqua will initially sell all of its salmon “to wholesalers and processing industry with a budgeted price of NOK 80/kg, however, observed prices are significantly higher”. As a result, “no marketing or sales resources needed and low-cost logistics available”.

The company “will gradually move up the value chain by targeting supermarkets” and “interest is expected to be high for unique freshness and premium quality product”. Also, the company has “additional opportunities and super profit from direct sales to consumers through e-commerce”, the fastest-growing market segment in China.

Nordic Aqua is also looking at value-added production, which would “require additional investments in processing, marketing, and distribution”. The “preferred strategy would be to partner up with a local processor with existing market presence and expertise”, the company said.

Strong team

The bottleneck for land-based capacity expansion is RAS operating experience, but Nordic Aqua has “secured one of the best RAS-teams in the world”, the document states.

Joensen, the former managing director of Mowi in Norway and also the company’s global head of technology, has been involved in more than 20 land-based facilities, the company said. He will lead the setup "to ensure optimized technical specifications of RAS-equipment and set instructions for operational procedures”.

He has been responsible for the design and construction of a RAS facility in the Faroe Islands for Mowi in 2017, and another which is under construction in Rogaland, Norway with Grieg Seafood and Bremnes Seashore as its largest owners.

Then, Rustan Lindquist, the company’s chief operating officer, will lead day-to-day operations and be responsible for training employees.

Lindquist has “extensive experience from farm operations”, both traditional and land-based, and has already led a full-scale RAS facility in China. He was in charge of construction and ramp-up of an 8,300-sq.-meter RAS facility in the country in 2014-2016. After this, he was the director of farm operations for Whole Oceans, which is setting up a RAS salmon farm in the US state of Maine, from August 2016 to February 2017.

Nordland, CEO of Nordic Aqua, has more than 20 years of experience in conducting business in China and is an honorary citizen of Ningbo, the presentation states. He founded the Nordic Industrial Park (NIP) in Ningbo and has supported “over 50 successful Nordic start-ups”. The NIP is an industrial park for companies with a combined turnover of $450m.

Then Knudsen, construction manager, has 19 years of experience from project management with marine and offshore solution company TTS in China and has managed and partaken in setting up multiple factories and JVs in China, the company said.
