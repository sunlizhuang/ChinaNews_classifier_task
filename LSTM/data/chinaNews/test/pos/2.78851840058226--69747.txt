AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal has invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to his swearing-in ceremony on Sunday at the Ramlila Grounds where the former will take oath as Delhi chief minister for the third time.

Kejriwal’s AAP stormed back to power in handsome fashion trouncing the BJP and winning 62 seats in the 70-member Delhi assembly. The BJP increased its seats tally to eight, from three in 2015. The Congress, however, once again drew a blank.

Wishing Kejriwal on his Delhi success, the PM had tweeted: “Congratulations to AAP and Shri @ArvindKejriwal Ji for the victory in the Delhi Assembly Elections. Wishing them the very best in fulfilling the aspirations of the people of Delhi.”

The BJP ran a tough campaign against Kejriwal with home minister Amit Shah fronting the rallies in the absence of a chief ministerial face. In the run-up to the polls, Kejriwal was even called a “terrorist” by a BJP leader.

Acknowledging the wishes from the PM, Kejriwal tweeted back: “Thank u so much sir. I look forward to working closely wid Centre to make our capital city into a truly world class city.”

Earlier AAP leader Gopal Rai said that the oath-taking ceremony of Kejriwal will be a Delhi specific event.

“No chief minister or political leader from other states will be invited for the ceremony that is going to be specific to Delhi,” Rai said.

Kejriwal is also likely to retain all the cabinet ministers who were part of his previous government, senior leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) confirmed on Wednesday.

The swearing-in ceremony in 2015, when the AAP won 67 seats, was also held at the Ramlila Maidan on February 14.
