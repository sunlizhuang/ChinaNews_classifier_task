On Feb 4, Wang Meihui, who works in the Foreign Affairs Office of Hainan Province, received a call from Nina, a worker at the Foreign Affairs Office of Southern Moravia in the Czech Republic. "Is everyone all right? Don't worry, we are always with Hainan," she said. Wang noted that while Southern Moravia established sisterhood relationships with Hainan in 2017, the two sides have become closer since the novel coronavirus outbreak.

In the following days, more and more international cities and provinces of Hainan reached out to the province in a variety of ways. Won Hee-ryong, the governor of Jeju Special Autonomous Province Governor in the Republic of Korea, recorded a video supporting Hainan.

"Jeju Special Autonomous Province will stand with Hainan and other provinces or cities in need across China. Come on, Hainan! Stay strong, China," he said in the video.

Other regions like Prince Edward Island in Canada and cities across North America have also expressed their willingness to collect and purchase medical supplies by utilizing their local resources to help Hainan prevent and control the disease.

Kang Baiying, deputy director of the Foreign Affairs Office of Hainan Province, noted that more than 20 consolation letters have been received from the province's international sister regions around the world.

As Hainan's first international sister province, Hyogo Prefecture of Japan has been especially supportive, as it was the first to lend a helping hand by donating a large number of disposable masks to support Hainan's epidemic prevention and control work. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of sister province relations between Hainan province and Hyogo Prefecture, and the mutual assistance has reflected the deep friendship between the two sides.

As of Feb 11, the Foreign Affairs Office of Hainan Province has received a large number of donated masks and latex gloves from Thailand, Japan, Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia, the United States, and other places. In the coming days, another batch of medical masks, goggles, and protective suits donated or commissioned to be purchased by sister provinces and foreign friends will arrive in the South China province.

"The mutual care and support between sister regions in difficult times fully demonstrates the love and spirit of internationalism that transcends national boundaries, which also bolsters Hainan's long-term efforts to promote international friendly exchanges," said Wang Sheng, director general of the Foreign Affairs Office of Hainan Province.

Wang added that the timely support from all foreign friends will boost the strength, courage, and confidence of Hainan residents in its efforts to win the battle against the epidemic.
