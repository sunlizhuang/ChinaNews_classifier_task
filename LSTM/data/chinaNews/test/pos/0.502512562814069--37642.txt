PETALING JAYA: MCA hopes for a better year ahead for all Malaysians, wishing everyone peace, harmony and good health.

"MCA hopes the Government will have the necessary wisdom and capability to steer our nation away from one obstacle after another," the party said this in conjunction with its "Back-to-Work Day" at MCA headquarters on Thursday (Jan 30).

The event was also marked with lion dance performances.

In a statement Thursday (Jan 30), the MCA publicity bureau said that the novel coronavirus outbreak unfortunately coincided with Chinese New Year celebrations.

"However difficult the situation may be, it is hoped that a solution will eventually be found," said the party.

MCA also reiterated its commitment to play the check and balance role to the government as an opposition party.

"We vow to continue to undertake our roles of checks and balances as an Opposition party," it added.

The Malaysian Government had imposed a temporary ban on Chinese citizens from Wuhan city and the surrounding Hubei province.

The Prime Minister's Office said the decision to suspend the issuance of visas to China nationals was made to contain the spread of the virus.
