ISLAMABAD: The Islam­abad High Court on Tuesday sought an assurance from the federal government about the well-being of Pak­is­tanis stranded in the coronavirus-hit areas of China.

During the hearing of identical petitions filed by Mian Faisal through his counsel Barrister Jahangir Khan Jadoon and Advocate Tariq Asad seeking a directive for the government to bring back Pakistani citizens from China, IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah observed that the government appeared to be mindful of this serious issue. He said the court expected the government to take a decision on the matter while keeping in mind the interest of Pakistani people.

When Advocate Asad suggested that the court issue an order for constitution of a medical board to ascertain the health condition of Pakistani citizens stranded in virus-hit China, Justice Minallah asked him if he was ready to give an undertaking along with his suggestion. The lawyer replied in negative.

The director (China) at the foreign ministry informed the court that there were “around 28,000 Pakistani students in China. A large number of them are PhD students and have families there. There are almost 1,094 Pakistani students and community members in Hubei province (Wuhan and Jing Zhou cities)”.

He said that “Wuhan and 13 cities around it are under complete lockdown. There are stringent measures in place to prevent the movement of people as an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus”.

The foreign ministry submitted to the court a report on the measures taken for the safety of the Pakistani community in China. It stated that the relevant ministries and Pakistani embassy in Beijing were in close coordination with the Chinese embassy in Islamabad. The report said the steps taken by the Chinese government for the protection of foreign nationals fulfilled the international obligations to address the legitimate concerns of foreigners in the country.

According to the report, there are foreign nationals of over 120 countries in Wuhan city and the evacuation of citizens is neither recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) nor the government of China.
