Asia continues to be one of the biggest growth markets in the world. With many different countries spanning this region, opportunities are endless for SME businesses looking to reach Asian consumers online. Demand for luxury brands and global products is soaring in China and it’s important to keep in mind the initial size of the opportunity for each region.
