This week may go down in history as the one in which Donald Trump was impeached. Or it may be remembered as the week in which actress and hawker of new-age wares Gwyneth Paltrow released a candle entitled: “This Smells Like My Vagina”. In the first rough draft of history stakes, they currently appear neck and neck, Paltrow’s burning bush possibly having the edge.

GP, as she likes to be referred to by her acolytes, also announced Goop at Sea (what next? Goop on Ice?), a cruising version of her sell-out wellness weekends, promising not only an audience with Paltrow herself, but “cutting-edge doctors, practitioners, and thought leaders,” plus sundry “goopy perks,” as part of life on the ocean wave.

And next Friday, her new Netflix series, The Goop Lab, premieres, billed as: “A curiosity-driven exploration of boundary-pushing wellness topics”. The advertisements for this show our heroine clad in plush pink, standing inside a series of labial shapes with the exhortation: “Reach new depths”.

One might rather say, "sink to new lows", but this is precisely the reaction GP is cashing in on, and laughing all the way to the bank. The candle is already sold out – thus a collectors’ item – although readers can avail themselves of a waiting list at shop.goop.com.
