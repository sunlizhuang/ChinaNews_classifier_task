THE Malaysian Rubber Board (MRB) refers to the letter “China stamps leadership in latex rubber harvesting” by Prof Datuk Dr Ahmad Ibrahim (The Star, Dec 23). The writer asserted that despite China not being among the leading producers of natural rubber, this has not stopped it from investing in the latest Industrial Revolution 4 (IR4.0) technologies to improve rubber productivity.

In particular, he pointed out that the Hainan Rubber Group had introduced a remote tapping mechanism which not only reduces dependence on labour but also matches the work of highly-skilled human tappers. He went on to say that this is something Malaysia can learn from.

While not disputing the observations he made during a visit to a Hainan rubber farming and

processing facility in China recently, the MRB wishes to clarify that we have never stopped R&D in latex harvesting and collection technology from the time it was

set up for this purpose decades ago. We are indeed committed to continuing with this for a lifetime to ensure that the industry is sustainable.

To correct this misconception and put things in the right perspective, we would like to point out that it was MRB that first announced the development of

the patented automated rubber tapping systems (ARTS) eight years ago in 2011, which was then acknowledged as the first of its kind in the world. This gained widespread coverage in Malaysia and most of the rubber-producing countries worldwide, especially in South-East Asia.

ARTS is a tapping device that is attached to individual rubber trees, which would tap the tree at pre-set intervals. All that’s left is to collect the latex.

This invention of ours was aimed at addressing key issues faced by the industry such as low productivity, labour shortage, increasing cost of production and sloppy rubber processing.

Obviously, what the Hainan group “invented” is, we strongly believe, a version of our very own prototype gadget that we patented eight years ago. Perhaps the group has added value to the whole system by honing some of the functions to improve productivity.

Let us be clear here that we are not downplaying Hainan’s fairly successful system. One should understand that the company is a huge national commercial entity that owns large tracts of rubber plantations.

Besides having state funding, it is not bogged down by the myriad of smallholdings, which is the real challenge faced by Malaysia.

The most daunting one is the cost factor as each ARTS unit costs about RM400. Unlike Hainan where there are large-scale company-owned rubber plantations, in Malaysia, in contrast, more than 90% of the rubber planting are owned by smallholders who number about 450,000 currently.

It is a simple case of Hainan which is 95% large-scale estate owned whereas Malaysia is 95% fragmented smallholders owned. Each smallholder owns an estimated two hectares of plantation and based on the prevailing rubber prices, earn about RM400 to RM500 per hectare.

So with an estimated 350 ARTS units required in each hectare, the smallholder will have to fork out RM140,000! Just imagine the financial impact if all smallholders were to purchase 350 units each. It would amount to a staggering RM63bil in total, and double that if they own two hectares each.

With the market price of rubber not showing much improvement over the years and prices being dependent mainly on the demand in the global market, the payback period would take ages for most, if not impossible. Obviously, this is not a viable option for all even if they are heavily subsidised by the government.

The government’s priority is to ease the burden of smallholders by providing fertilisers and cash aid when prices dip below a certain level, especially during the wintering and rainy seasons.

A total of RM300mil has been allocated under the 2020 Budget, which consists of RM200mil for the Monsoon Season Aid (Bantuan Musim Tengkujuh) that will be distributed by the Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority (Risda) and Sabah Rubber Industry Board and RM100mil for the Rubber Production Incentive (RPI) that will be distributed by MRB.

In addition, the total budget spent on RPI from 2015 to 2020 is around RM238mil.

These incentives are given to smallholders annually to help them make ends meet. Without such aid, it would be impossible for this category of Malaysians to survive. This remains our priority for now in view of the rise in the cost of living.

It is pertinent here to remind Malaysians that the MRB has indeed scored several successes in its years of R&D in latex harvesting and collection technology besides the ARTS. Among them are the battery-operated knives, Auto Punch, RRRIMflow, closed piping latex collection and special latex collection vehicles.

We are fully aware and conscious that the advent of IR4.0 is indeed changing the landscape of industries and ours is no exception. We have to embrace it or be left behind, much to the detriment of the nation.

As such, we would like to assure the taxpayers who fund our

operations that the MRB and the Malaysian rubber industry will continue their R&D in continuously enhancing latex harvesting

technology to help develop innovative systems to ensure the sustainability of the Malaysian rubber industry.

With the new government pushing for reforms to cut leakages and become cost-effective, the MRB promises to be transparent in all of its operations.

As always, we welcome positive feedback from those who feel that they can be part of the change we aspire to be.
