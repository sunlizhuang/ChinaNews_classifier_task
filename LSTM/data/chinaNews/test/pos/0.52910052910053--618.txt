NREL Research Boosts Stability of Perovskites, Helps Silicon Solar Cells A change in chemical composition enabled scientists to boost the longevity and efficiency of a perovskite solar cell developed at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

Crystal Paint for Solar Panels Could Innovate Renewable Energy Now, researchers have developed a new way of creating solar panels that may make it easier to install than ever before - a crystal-based liquid that has allowed researchers to effectively paint on solar panels to suitable surfaces.

INTERSOLAR and looking ahead to 2020 - Q&A with Panasonic Even though there are short term impacts to installation rates due to policy changes, historically solar and energy storage has only grown and will continue to grow. Energy storage in particular has a significant potential to grow this year. Booth #1616

S2A's #GreenLuxHome Will Feature the World's Only Patented Graphene Solar Panel From FreeVolt The first electrically self-sustaining, custom luxury homes from S2A will be powered by the only graphene solar panel in existence globally, changing the game with unprecedented energy production, durability, immunity to climate, and overall service life.

Dye Sensitized Solar Cells Is the Future of Solar The dye sensitized solar cell can produce electricity under low light conditions, including indoor lighting. Due to the structural design and different color dyes, the cell features colors and transparency.

Printed Solar Cells - Electric partnership powers energy innovation Created by University of Newcastle Physicist, Professor Paul Dastoor, organic printed solar cells are electronic inks printed onto sub-millimetre thin plastic sheets using conventional printers.

New Testing Facility Launches: Is the Future of Utility-Scale Solar Projects in Bifacial? The new facility will serve as the test ground for analyzing and validating field data to determine optimal system output utilizing bifacial modules with tracking technology under a range of variables and conditions.

AC Solar Modules Integrating the module and the inverter is a natural evolution. In the PC industry, silicon semiconductor components have been continuously integrated to reduce manufacturing cost, reduce complexity, and simplify the customer experience.

This weird $9 trick increases solar panel efficiency 5-17% John Fitzgerald Weaver for electrek: Instead of perfectly spacing those 60 out - with small, defined areas between the cells - the company has allowed the solar cells borders to overlap each other while increasing the cell count to 68.

Solar panels: Nanotechnology gives green energy a green color American Institute of Physics via Science Daily: Researchers have created green solar panels using soft imprint lithography to print an array of nanocylinders that scatter green light

New process for manufacturing PV cells means cheaper solar power Phys.org: A major roadblock to the mass use of solar energy are photovoltaic (PV) solar cells. This is because the cost, inefficiency and negative environmental impact that the manufacturing of these cells outweighs any potential savings provided by the resulting solar energy. If, however, cost could be were minimised, then solar power would be more able to compete with traditional fossil fuel-based methods for generating energy. To overcome this hurdle, the EU-funded SOLNOWAT project has developed an innovative dry process for manufacturing PV solar cells. PV cells are typically created via a wet chemical process that etches away layers of silicon from a crystalline wafer, leaving behind the solar cell. The SOLNOWAT process replaces the expensive and inefficient wet chemical process with the use of atmospheric pressure dry etching technology – a process that cuts costs and speeds up production. Because less silicon is removed during dry etching, the resulting cells are darker, making them very efficient at absorbing light. In fact, they are so efficient that they have been classified as having zero global warming potential. Cont'd...

Chinese solar company opening local module factory in September Victor A. Patton for Sacramento Business Journal: A solar module factory expected to bring more than 200 jobs to Sacramento is slated to begin production in mid-September at McClellan Business Park. It will be the first U.S. factory for Nanjing, China-based solar cell and module manufacturer China Sunergy Co, who on Thursday announced its subsidiary Sunergy America has agreed to lease a 140,000-square-foot manufacturing building — previously a plant where J.C. Penney made window coverings. Simon Szeto, a Sunergy advisor, said the company will bring around 20 management staff from overseas and will hire other employees locally. The work being done at the factory will include putting together the modules. Each module includes a solar cell, an aluminum frame, tempered glass, cables and a junction box. The completed products, which can be placed on a ground mount or rooftop, will be sold commercially in the U.S, Szeto said. Cont'd...

SolarCity pushing industry to 40% increase in useful lifetime of solar power installations John Fitzgerald Weaver for Electrek: In a new report released by SolarCity, we are seeing that solar power systems have a usable lifetime of at least 35 years – 40% longer than the market expects. The key finding of the report is that power degradation (annual efficiency loss) of solar panels supplied to SolarCity is as much as 35% lower than for a comparable industry-wide selection of non-SolarCity panels, which are typically expected to last for 25 years. SolarCity feels it is the implementation of a stringent and industry-leading “Total Quality Program” that has driven this. SolarCity is in the unique position of being one of the largest deployers of solar panels – from multiple manufacturers – in the world, and with their tens of thousands of systems connected to a central database they know realtime performance. In the study here, SolarCity looked at greater than 11,000 panels to determine their data points and come to their conclusion that their solar panels are performing well beyond expected industry standards.
