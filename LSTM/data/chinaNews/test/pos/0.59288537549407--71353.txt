The Minister of Health has extended the travel ban on people travelling from or through mainland China for a further eight day period.

The announcement today by the Minister of Health has been made based on the latest scientific and medical advice provided by relevant experts. They have advised that the risk to public health in New Zealand and the Pacific Islands warrants an extension of the current border measures.

The current temporary border measures will be retained for an additional eight day period expiring at 23:59 on Monday 24 Feb 2020.

The Minstry of Health has reiterated that these travel restrictions only apply to people travelling through mainland China in the last 14 days. There is no requirement for people travelling to New Zealand from places outside mainland China to have a ‘stay away’ period.

The Ministry of Education, TEC, and NZQA are working together and all tertiary education organisations (TEOs) have been contacted with information about the coronavirus and additional border controls.

The Prime Minister made an announcement on February 2 that includes the following information concerning all foreign nationals travelling from, or transiting through mainland China:

“The Government is placing temporary entry restrictions into New Zealand on all foreign nationals travelling from, or transiting through mainland China to assist with the containment of the novel coronavirus and to protect New Zealand and the Pacific Islands from the disease.

“This will take effect from tomorrow and will be in place for up to 14 days. This position will be reviewed every 48 hours.

“Any foreign travellers who leave or transit through mainland China after 2 February 2020 (NZ time) will be refused entry to New Zealand.

“Any foreign travellers in transit to New Zealand on 2 February 2020 will be subject to enhanced screening on arrival but, pending clearance, will be granted entry to New Zealand.

“New Zealand citizens and permanent residents returning to New Zealand will still be able to enter, as will their immediate family members, but will be required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival back in the country.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has also raised its travel advice to New Zealanders for all of mainland China to ‘Do not travel’, the highest level.”

While there are no confirmed or suspected cases in New Zealand at the moment, the Ministry of Health continues to encourage a precautionary approach and a focus on good hygiene. Please err on the side of caution and be alert, not alarmed.
