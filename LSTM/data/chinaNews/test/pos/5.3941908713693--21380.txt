Din Tai Fung are celebrating Chinese New Year with red and gold dumplings

Red and Gold dumplings for Chinese New Year

Just when you thought it was time to pack away your party clothes, it’s time to mark your calendars and welcome the Year of the Rat.

While preparations for the new year started on January 17, Chinese New Year – also known as the Spring Festival or the Lunar New Year – officially begins on Saturday January 25 and ends on February 4.

Chinese traditions for the day include eating dumplings, setting off fireworks, and avoiding things like showering, sweeping and throwing out garbage – all of which are taboo on January 25.

The day is celebrated by millions of people, whether of Chinese descent or not, all around the world. Here’s how you can join in the festivities over the next fortnight.

SYDNEY

Lunar Lanes Haymarket street party

Celebrations on January 25 will transform Haymarket’s laneways into a street party, with performances by Sydney’s Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, Taiwanese and Japanese communities.
