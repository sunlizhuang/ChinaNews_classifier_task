CHENGDU: Southwest China's Sichuan Province plans to build four industrial parks for boosting international and regional cooperation by 2023, according to the local government.

The province plans to improve the level of foreign investments by introducing more foreign companies to the parks and encouraging them to contribute to the operation of the parks, according to a 2020-2023 plan released by the provincial government.

Foreign investment in these parks is expected to increase two-fold compared with the level in 2019, the plan said.

Sichuan now has 16 industrial parks with cooperation ties with multiple countries and regions including France, Germany, the Republic of Korea, and Italy.

Local governments in cities like Wuhan, the capital of central Hubei province, and Chengdu are eager to boost innovation and cultivate the next big technology unicorns.

As such, they have pledged millions to build high-technology parks and offered preferential policies and tax exemptions to big companies that are willing to open up offices and bring talent to the cities.

Cities across China have been investing heavily in technology, innovation, and startups amid a broader push by the central government to strengthen the tech sector and build an innovation-driven economy.

As of 2016, China’s over 7,500 incubators and makerspaces had fostered over 223,000 businesses, according to the Torch High Technology Industry Development Center led by China’s Ministry of Science and Technology.

Chengdu, for example, is well-known for its Tianfu Software Park – Asia’s largest business IT park that also houses an incubator that provides startups with funding, office spaces, and connections to investors.- Xinhua/Asian News Network
