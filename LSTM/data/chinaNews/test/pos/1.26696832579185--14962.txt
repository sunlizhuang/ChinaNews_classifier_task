Xi went to a village of the Wa ethnic group in Tengchong, a city bordering Myanmar, to learn about poverty alleviation efforts and extend his Chinese New Year's greetings to the villagers, Xinhua reported on Sunday.During his tour, Xi said after China completes the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, it is necessary to comprehensively promote rural vitalization and further address problems, including the imbalance between urban and rural development, Xinhua reported Monday.Xu Liping, director of the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday that due to the significant geographic location of Yunnan, the province has been designed to be an economic high ground to allow Southeast Asian and South Asian countries to share in China's economic growth and to realize joint development in the region.Li Chenyang, vice president of Yunnan University and director of the university's Center for Myanmar Studies, said Yunnan is facing a historic opportunity, because during Xi's visit to Myanmar, a series of cooperation documents were signed and many of them involved Yunnan."The province needs to speed up the implementation of these agreements and find its own advantages during the process of building the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, to make itself a platform for other Chinese provinces to cooperate with Myanmar, and realize high-quality development for themselves," Li noted.Yunnan reduced its poverty-stricken population from 8.04 million in 2012 to 1.79 million in 2018, according to a survey conducted by a team of the National Bureau of Statistics in the province, Xinhua said.During his visit to the Wa village, Xi beat a wooden drum three times according to local custom to wish favorable weather for bumper harvests, peace for the country and the people, and peace for the world.Wa is a cross-border ethic group between China and Myanmar; so culturally, the border areas of both countries also have a strong connection, and this is also a unique advantage of Yunnan, Chinese experts said.In the past few years, due to war refugees from occasional military conflicts between different ethnic groups in Myanmar close to China's border, the economic development of the border region has been impacted.The situation has since stabilized but the reconciliation process of different ethnic groups of Myanmar remains incomplete, so it will likely bring potential risks and uncertainties to the poverty alleviation campaign in the Chinese border areas as well as regional development, Xu said.CCTV reported on Monday that Xi also inspected a People's Liberation Army (PLA) border defense battalion in Yunnan on Sunday.China is now constructively intervening in the Myanmar ethnic groups' reconciliation process, and making efforts to mediate in the conflicts and minimize the negative impact with the appointment of Sun Guoxiang as a special envoy for Asian affairs to closely communicate with different forces in Myanmar, Xu noted.On November 6, 2019, China donated $400,000 for the Myanmar government's peace process in Nay Pyi Taw. Sun, the special Envoy for Asian Affairs of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, presented the cash donation to U Kyaw Tint Swe, vice-chairman of Myanmar's National Reconciliation and Peace Center, Xinhua reported.
