KUNMING, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- A total of 87 students from Myanmar have received skills training in Longling County, southwest China's Yunnan Province, as the educational exchanges and cooperation strengthen between Yunnan and Myanmar.

The students, in different batches, received skills training at Longling Vocational High School in the city of Baoshan, mainly learning jade carving, computer skills, car maintenance, Chinese cooking and other skills, according to the local education department.

Among them, 80 students have graduated from the vocational high school, and the other seven students are still learning jade carving skills in Longling.

"Most of the graduates have returned to Myanmar to work or start their businesses with their mastered skills from China, bringing good social benefits," said Li Lifang, a teacher at Longling County Vocational High School.

With the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative in recent years, the China-Myanmar border city of Baoshan has sped up its opening to the outside world and deepened educational and cultural exchanges with Myanmar.
