Kenin arrived in the semis following a win over trailblazing Tunisian Ons Jabeur, after earlier ending the fairytale run of teen sensation Coco Gauff.

Riding a nine-match winning streak, Barty takes a 4-1 head-to-head series lead into her clash with Kenin, having triumphed in their most recent meeting on the hard courts of Wuhan last September.

In a treat for fans, they can watch both women’s semifinals – played back-to-back – on a Rod Laver Arena day session ticket.

The second semifinal is a blockbuster between two-time major champions and former world No.1s Simona Halep and Garbine Muguruza.

After dropping the first set of her Australian Open campaign 6-0 to Shelby Rogers, Muguruza has gathered momentum, powering past top-10 foes Elina Svitolina and Kiki Bertens without dropping a set in a resurgent fortnight at Melbourne Park.

She has won three of five career meetings with Halep, who on Wednesday routed Anett Kontaveit 6-1 6-1 to continue her dominance at Australian Open 2020, where she is yet to drop a set.
