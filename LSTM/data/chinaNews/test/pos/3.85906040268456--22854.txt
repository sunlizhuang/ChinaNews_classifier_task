We may be well into the start of 2020, but in the traditional Chinese calendar the new year has not yet begun.

Chinese New Year, which take place on Saturday, January 25 this year, is eagerly celebrated the world over, with the festivities often taking place over several weeks.

This year is the year of the Metal Rat.

Among the most visually spectacular parts of the festivities are the lion dances, where two or more dancers squeeze into colourful costumes before performing the traditional movement.

The dancers are often skilled in martial arts, from which the actions in the dance originate.

In Chinese culture the lion symbolises power and wisdom, and the dance is performed to ward off evil spirits, bless people and buildings and bring good fortune for the upcoming year.

Across Berkshire there will be four dances taking place at the end of January.

There will be two performances by the Hulutang Kung Fu school, one at 12pm and another at 2pm.

The same group will also perform on Monday, January 27 the in the Genting Casino in Richfield Avenue in Reading, Berkshire.

The performance will start at midnight, but those wishing to watch are urged to arrive by 11.50pm on Sunday, January 26 to avoid disappointment.

The Hulutang Kung Fu dojo

Three of the lion dances in Berkshire are being performed by the Hulutang Kung Fu dojo, which meets at the Preistwood Community Centre in Bracknell and the Centrepoint Community Centre in Earley.

Shifu master Sun Miao Xiao, who leads the Hulutang school, said: "I've been practising for 30 years.

"I learned my skills from a master in the Fujian Province, and I've been running clubs for a few years.

"The branch in Earley is quite new, it's been going for around six months.

"We practice the Five Ancestors Fist Kung Fu style."

The Five Ancestors Fist style was founded by Shaolin monk Bai Yufeng.
