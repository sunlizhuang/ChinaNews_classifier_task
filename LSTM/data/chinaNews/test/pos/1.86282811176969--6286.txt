The Brockton area has a growing food manufacturing base, according to economic development experts. Brockton food manufacturers make products that run the gamut from Chicago-style deep dish pizza to high-end smoked salmon.

BROCKTON – It used to be shoes that were made in Brockton.



But in more recent years, the manufacturing of foods has become bread and butter for the local economy. And many of the food products that are made in Brockton can be found in local grocery stores, including frozen pizza, seasoning kits, sushi rolls and salad dressing.



"The food business is one of the larger industrial clusters that we have here," said Rob May, Brockton's director of planning and economic development.



And it's growing, May said.

Currently, a tortilla company behind Tortilleria Mi Niña chips called New England Tortilla LLC, is constructing a new facility that it plans to open on West Chestnut Street, in an industrial area where several food companies are based. The city planner pointed to the city's ample supply of water and a capable local labor force as factors that attract food manufacturers to Brockton.



"We'd like to attract more," May said.



So, what foods are made in Brockton that shoppers can find at the super market?

Cindy's Kitchen produces a line of salad dressings, sauces and dips at its 60,000-square-foot facility in an industrial area on the south side of Brockton, and its products can be found in upscale supermarkets and grocery stores with natural, organic sections around the country, such as Roche Bros., Star Market and Whole Foods, along with independent chains like Lee's Market in Massachusetts and Dave's Marketplace in R.I. The Brockton company's selection of hundreds of products includes a buttermilk ranch dressing that's been a top seller and has been rated as one of the best in the country by Rachel Ray Every Day Magazine and Real Simple, which both conducted taste tastes of ranch dressings made throughout the country.

Cindy's Kitchen owner Ed Byers started his business about 20 years ago in a small building on the west side of Brockton, before arriving in 2007 at the company's present 40 Industrial Boulevard location, which recently underwent a $6 million expansion, including new equipment, doubling the size of the building. Byers said he chose to operate in Brockton because he grew up in the city and because the community has a talented, hard-working labor force, including immigrants from Cape Verde, China, Haiti and other countries.

"It's the new makeup of Brockton," said Byers, who recently gave The Enterprise a tour of the building. "It's no different than when I grew up here, when it was Italian, Irish, and Portuguese. You hear about all the bad stuff in Brockton, but nobody even talks about all the great workers here."

Cindy's Kitchen has 145 employees, and for some of them it's a family affair, with close relatives working together under the same roof, Byers said. Those workers include people like Licinio Andrade, a 12-year veteran of the company, who came from Cape Verde and has since bought a house in the city.

"It's something I never thought before that I would do," Andrade said. "I like it. It's a good company, a good, steady job."

Another item that's available in grocery stories across the country is made on the north side of the city.

It may be called Chicago-style deep dish pizza, but the Uno Pizzeria & Grill brand frozen pies are actually made in Brockton. Since 1988, Uno Foods has operated in Brockton, with a 50,000-square-foot USDA-approved bakery plant at 180 Spark St.

Mike Murnane, president and chief revenue officer for Uno Foods, said the frozen food plant in Brockton grew out of a catering operation at an Uno pizzeria in Boston. The company currently produces more than 35,000 frozen pizzas per day using dough made at its Brockton plant, churning out nine-inch pies, six-inch personal pizzas, calzones and flatbread pizza.

"If you’re from Brockton, and you see Uno pizza at Big Y or at Market Basket, that’s us," Murnane said. "We’re making that pizza. Everyone is pretty proud of the facility and what we do. We use the restaurant recipes and ingredients."

Uno Foods has about 150 employees, and the majority come from Brockton, Murnane said.

"I’ve been very impressed with our workers," Murnene said. "Our workers are Brockton workers. There is really a good culture in our plant."

Chris Cooney, president and CEO of the Metro South Chamber of Commerce, said the food production industry is "an important part" of the local economy, providing "clean, green jobs" for people who live in the Brockton area.

"The city likes it because it's low-impact," Cooney said. "You're not creating dust or smoke or that type of thing, and you're creating quality food."

Cooney said the Brockton area makes more food products than most people know, rattling off a list of companies such as Boston Fresh, a produce wholesaler and processor, which among many other things makes fresh pico de gallo, salsas and cold-pressed juices; Fuji Foods, which makes ready-to-eat sushi for grocery stores; and Concord Foods, which has long mad caramel apple kits, lemon juice sold in yellow plastic containers that look like the sour fruit, flavoring and seasoning packets that are sold in produce sections, and the coffee flavoring syrups that are offered with drinks at Dunkin' Donuts stores.

Cooney said several Brockton restaurants have also developed product lines, namely Cape Cod Cafe, making frozen pizzas and distributing them to grocery stores in the region, the Italian Kitchen, which has a bakery, and JJ's Caffe, which sells its own brand of hot sauce called "Fogo Fire" hot sauce.

One food company that goes under the radar is the historic F.B. Washburn Candy company, known for selling a Christmas specialty, ribbon candy, beginning as an offshoot to the Washburn bakery in 1856. Another is Spence & Co. Ltd, which produces "very high-end" smoked salmon in Brockton, Cooney said.

"Everyone has got to eat," Cooney said. "It's an industry that will continue on."

Councilor-at-large Moises Rodrigues, who was mayor at the time (appointed by his colleagues to serve the remaining term following mayor Bill Carpenter's death in July), said that during a recent trip to Cape Verde, he brought gift baskets for mayors of the island country with food items that were made in Brockton, including samples of products from Concord Foods.

"I was totally surprised, happily surprised, to see all the products that they actually make," Rodrigues said. "I was proud of the fact on the back that it says, 'Brockton, Mass.' Once upon a time ago, we were known as the shoe capital of this area. It'd be nice if we could jump into becoming the food production capital of Massachusetts."
