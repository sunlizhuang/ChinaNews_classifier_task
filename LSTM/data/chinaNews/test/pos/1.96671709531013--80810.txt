It’s been a busy week in news about filmmakers and movie stars jumping to the small screen, starting with the news that Good Time and Uncut Gems directors Benny and Josh Safdie are developing a comedy for Showtime and continuing with news that Jennifer Lawrence is making a Netflix movie, and Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd are teaming up for the first time since Anchorman 2 to adapt a podcast for TV. And there’s so much more than that in our wrap of the week in TV news.

SAFDIES AND NATHAN FIELDER WILL CREATE A FAUX HGTV SERIES IN THE CURSE

Who knew Benny and Josh Safdie were HGTV fans? But it seems that the brothers have at least watched a few episodes of a certain HGTV series given the plot of their just-greenlit Showtime comedy pilot, The Curse. In it, the brothers team with Nathan For You star Nathan Fielder to tell the story of a married couple – hosts of a fictional HGTV series called Flipanthropy – whose relationship on-screen and off is rocked by a curse.

Fielder will play the husband, while Benny Safdie will play the Flipanthropy producer in the series, while both, along with Josh Safdie, will serve as executive producers on the project.

As Deadline points out, the plot sounds somewhat similar to the real HGTV series Flip or Flop, in which Tarek El Moussa and Christina Anstead find and flip houses for profit. The two were married to each other when the series made them household names, but saw their marriage crash and burn as the show grew in popularity.

The new project also sounds similar to the upcoming Quibi comedy Flipped, in which a couple played by Kaitlin Olson and Will Forte run afoul of the mob while trying to become basic cable home reno experts.

The Safdies recently won an Independent Spirit Award for Best Director for the Adam Sandler thriller Uncut Gems, while Fielder is a Writers Guild of America award winner for Nathan for You.

Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence is out to save the world from a racing meteor — or, at least, she’ll play a scientist who hopes to do that very thing in an upcoming Netflix comedy written and directed by fellow Oscar winner Adam McKay. Don’t Look Up will follow two scientists who must convince the population that they have just six months to prepare for a meteor crashing into our planet, though the world doesn’t seem to be fazed by the looming danger.

The movie will begin production in April for a planned release in late 2020.

Jude Law will lead the cast, while Waititi will write the half-hour comedy with Peter Warren (Ghost Team).
