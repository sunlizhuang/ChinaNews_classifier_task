IPOH: Despite the recent closure of the RM520 million Movie Animation Park Studios (MAPS) here, the Perak government has put in place plans to ensure the state remains a preferred tourist destination.

State Tourism, Arts and Culture Committee chairman Tan Kar Hing said the closure of the theme park will have an impact on tourism. But efforts were being made to ensure that the silver state continues to be popular tourism draw.

“We already know that MAPS is one of the must-visit places here, but since the closure of the theme park, it will definitely bring impact to us. However, we are doing our best to create more must-visit places in Ipoh as well as outside Ipoh.

“For instance, this year we will have a new development project in Ipoh, which is the Ipoh Light and Sound Show in Padang Ipoh. That attraction is expected to be completed by end of this year.

“We will also have a digital library which will kick off soon. I know it is not easy but we will try our best. With the recent novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) case, it will also affect our tourism industry,” he said during a press conference after inspecting the venue of the state-level Chinese New Year celebration at Bandar Seri Botani Eco Park 1 here, today.

It was reported that MAPS closed its operations on Jan 28 and would remain closed until further notice.

The closure notice was issued by the Receiver and Manager of Animation Theme Park Sdn Bhd (ATP) from Messrs Ernst & Young.

Last year, a portal reported that Affin Investment had appointed Datuk Duar Tuan Kiat of Messrs Ernst & Young on Dec 4 as the receiver and manager of property belonging to ATP, the operator of MAPS.

On the Chinese New Year event, Tan said the public should not be worried to attend the event since there was no human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus reported in the country.

“The Health Ministry and Gopeng member of parliament (Deputy Health Minister, Dr Lee Boon Chye) had told us that the show must go on and people should not panic,” said Tan.

The state-level Chinese New Year celebration will be graced by the Sultan of Perak, Sultan Nazrin Muizzuddin Shah this Thursday between 6pm and 11pm.
