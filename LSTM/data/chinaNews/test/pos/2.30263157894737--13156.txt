LOS ANGELES — Jamie Young Co. is bringing 75 new lighting, decor and accent furniture pieces from its 2020 collections to the Atlanta and Las Vegas markets.

Aiming to continue its globally inspired design style, design-duo and founders Jamie Jeter and David Jeter traveled frequently last year — visiting India, Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam, China and the Philippines — to find new inspiration and creation methods for these debuts.

From their travels, 2020 product introductions are inspired by cultural traditions and artisanship from Eastern Asia and feature a variety of new finishes and techniques.

“Our new accessories are all about scale and texture using natural materials in ceramic, glass, marble and wood,” said Jamie Jeter. “All our glass pieces are works of art, individually mouth-blown with thick layers of different shards of colored glass. Our new wood accents are an extension of our popular large wooden vases adding new shapes and stained darer finishes.”

Jamie Young Co. has also expanded its existing product categories by adding new and indoor/outdoor furniture pieces including consoles, bar-carts and stools. Other additions to the brand’s furniture offerings include metal pieces that utilize a natural acid finish to produce one-of-a-kind items.

For the company’s complete 2020 in-line catalog, the company highlighted 350 new pieces and collections in a broad variety of styles.

Among the catalog’s standouts are Lifestyle, a strategically priced collection that offers the same design aesthetic and quality as the company’s traditional offerings at a lower price. This collection has existed for several seasons, but is being included for the first time this year in the main line catalog.
