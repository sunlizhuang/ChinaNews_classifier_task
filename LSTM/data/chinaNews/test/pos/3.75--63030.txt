Appreciation for Chinese ink painting is growing, but much of the art form remains unexplored. An ink painting comes into being when ink meets paper. But the role of the latter in shaping or responding to an artist’s style is often overlooked. Revered artist Liu Dan has observed that the “language of ink” is created by a group of people—the papermaker, brushmaker and maker of ink. In the era of the “rockstar” artist, many neglect the role of paper and papermaking.

UNSUNG HEROES OF INK seeks to redress this balance. We hear artists Liu Dan and Shao Fan explain how xuan paper shapes their work. We also see their collaborators—craftspeople in the remote Jing County, Anhui Province, who use ancient methods to hand-produce xuan paper. The craftspeople, who have spent a lifetime honing their skills, are the “unsung heroes of ink”.

Post-screening discussion with film director Olivia Wang, papermaker She Xianbing, art historian Yang Hongzhe and moderated by M+ Paper Conservator Jo-Fan Huang.

The conversation will be held in Mandarin and English, with simultaneous translation in English
