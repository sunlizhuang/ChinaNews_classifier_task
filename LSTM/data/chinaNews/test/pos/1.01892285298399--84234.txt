"Diagnosis and treatment are essential, and prevention is even more important. In addition to our daily routine work, we have devoted a lot of energy to give free medical consultation and popularize health knowledge at grassroots level," Liu Xin said.

Liu, a deputy chief physician at the Minimally Invasive Center of Gynecology of Beijing Maternity Hospital affiliated to the Capital Medical University, made the remark after a lecture at the People's Hospital of Hotan Prefecture in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

She has been training local medical personnel at the hospital since early March in 2019 in an effort to help more local women with her expertise.

The gynecology department of the hospital has the best team in the prefecture. With the help of doctors assisting Xinjiang, it has become a training base for resident gynecologists.

The department carries out about 100 surgeries every month and receives more than 30,000 patients annually. It also offers training programs for doctors across the autonomous region throughout the year.

Liu promotes advanced technology and frontier medical ideas in Hotan. Minimally invasive medicine includes minimally invasive surgery and is one of the most cutting-edge medical sciences.

There was once a patient who was diagnosed with 20-centimeter uterine fibroids at the People's Hospital of Hotan Prefecture. She was unable to receive surgery due to her extreme obesity and the size of her myoma, or tumor.

Liu persuaded her colleagues to give up the operation plan and suggested a minimal invasive method â€” reducing the myoma first and then removing it.

When a 25-year-old woman was at death's door due to bleeding of an iliac vein after a radical operation of cervical cancer, Liu gave a call to an expert in Beijing at once to seek advice, then invited vascular surgery specialists to help rescue the patient.

Thanks to six hours of joint efforts from various departments, the woman was brought back to life.

During her days in Hotan, Liu has found that local women's lack of awareness of their health usually leads to fateful consequences and presents enormous challenges to clinicians.

Therefore, she decided to lead the team to offer the best medical services to local patients in line with the standards in Beijing's top hospitals.

Ayinur Abudukeremu, one of her colleagues, said Liu gets along well with them and is like an elder sister.

She said Liu is conscientious and responsible. Liu not only guides the younger generations to learn the guidelines prevailing in China and abroad but also teaches them in real situations, helping improve their professional skills.

Liu spends a great deal of time reviewing numerous references to prepare for lectures on the prevention and treatment of gynecological tumors.

She often offers free medical services in rural areas, popularizing health knowledge among locals.

Liu has also joined hands with a local radio station to promote the prevention and treatment of some typical women's diseases.

Fan Xia, director of the gynecology department, spoke highly of Liu, saying that Liu brought advanced concepts and technologies to Hotan and helped build a bridge of friendship for minimally invasive medical personnel between Beijing and the Hotan Prefecture.
