SHANGHAI, Feb 18 (SMM) – Producers of electrolytic manganese in the major producing hub of Guizhou are resuming production this week, as logistics recover after authorities lifted restrictions on transportation at the end of last week.

Large and medium-scale manganese producers in southwest China’s Guizhou told SMM that they will gradually restart their production lines this week. Daily output of electrolytic manganese across the region is expected to recover to 100-200 mt in the early stage of the resumption.

Current quotes for spot manganese in the “Manganese Delta” at the junction of Guizhou, Hunan, and Chongqing are hovering between 12,500-13,000 yuan/mt.

SMM expects manganese prices to stay around 12,500 yuan/mt in the short term, as supply has yet to ramp up and as demand remains muted.
