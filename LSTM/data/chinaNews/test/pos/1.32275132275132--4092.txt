Luo Huining and Carrie Lam said their priority is to stop the violence.

Beijing's new man in Hong Kong, Luo Huining, praised Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor for her hard work and courage in handling the social unrest during their first meeting at Government House yesterday.

The liaison office said last night it will "sufficiently respect and fully support" Lam and the Hong Kong government to act according to the law.

Luo was quoted as saying that since the beginning of the unrest - which was triggered by the fugitive bill amendment - Lam has dedicatedly worked on stopping the violence and stabilizing the situation.

"[Luo] pays tribute to her courage and dedication," the office said.

Lam and Luo agreed their job would be stopping the violence and safeguarding the rule of law and that Beijing's push to further implement one country, two systems should be followed.

They also agreed to strengthen their cooperation and work together on Hong Kong affairs.

In a separate statement, Lam said she briefed Luo on the social unrest.

"Both parties considered that Hong Kong had experienced the most challenging situation since its return to the motherland during the past seven months, affecting seriously all aspects of society, and that restoring social order as soon as possible is the common aspiration of the public," a government press statement said.

Luo and Lam are confident that "Hong Kong will be able to relaunch itself and open a new page, as well as better integrate into the overall development of the nation and achieve long-term prosperity and stability."

She added that the government will actively consider adopting measures to relieve people's burden. Their meeting started at 2.30pm and ended at about 4pm.

It followed Luo's meeting with Shenzhen's top officials, including party chief Wang Weizhong and mayor Chen Rugui in the mainland city on Wednesday.

Also attending were five of the seven deputy directors of Luo's office, commissioner of Beijing's foreign ministry Xie Feng, and other Shenzhen officials.

Shenzhen Satellite TV reported that the two sides agreed they had to unwaveringly implement one country, two systems, and push forward the two cities' cooperation on areas such as trade and entrepreneurship.

Luo, 65, replaced Wang Zhimin as the director of the liaison office on Saturday.
