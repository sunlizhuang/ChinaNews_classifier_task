Bosnos and her husband Michael have put their building on the market and are emphasizing to potential buyers the fact that the building at 2229 N. Country Club lies in the Grant Road opportunity zone. Whoever buys it can take advantage of tax breaks that were part of Congress’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act aimed at spurring long-term investments in low-income urban and rural communities nationwide.

The Grant Road Corridor from Tucson Boulevard to Swan Road is one of several designated opportunity zones in Tucson.

Bosnos is hoping whoever buys her building will come in with plans for a night club or music venue. That’s the only thing missing in the midtown area, which draws customers from all ends of the city.

“The thing that is interesting about that area is that people from the east side really don’t go to the northwest side and people from the north don’t go to the east side. But everybody will come to midtown,” said the 75-year-old retiree. “And actually it’s better than downtown because downtown is so busy and very hard to park.”

Bosnos, who commuted from the east side the entire time she ran her shop, is moving near Banner UMC in the next couple months. She, like many people she knows, is tired of the traffic that comes with driving to central Tucson from the east side.

“There is getting to be more and more of a real appreciation for not having to drive 30 minutes to get across town,” she explained. “I think the appeal is exactly that part of town.”
