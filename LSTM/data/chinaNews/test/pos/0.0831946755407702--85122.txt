Ms. Anggono realized she had a knack for restaurant management, first in Colorado, then after moving to New York in 2000. From 2004 to 2011, she was co-owner of a pan-Asian restaurant in Holtsville, on Long Island, where she experimented with Indonesian offerings like grilled satay skewers and beef rendang. She eventually got a green card, which inspired her to help other Indonesian immigrants navigate the byzantine path to American residency and then citizenship.

“I felt so blessed,” she said. “So now I tell people: ‘In Indonesia, if you have money, you can do anything, you can buy paperwork. But here it’s about the truth. No matter what, you have your rights as a human being.’ ”

Ms. Anggono’s twin passions for Indonesian cooking and American bureaucracy inspired her to start the bazaar. She recruited cooks through the local community and on Facebook, and helped new vendors apply for food-vendor and fire-safety permits.

“Sometimes they get upset with me,” she said with a smirk, “because I make them get all their paperwork. So I tell them, ‘You want to sell food here but not follow the rules?’ You need patience to organize something like this.”

At the bazaar, Ms. Anggono flitted among vendors, helping with logistics and resolving disputes between cooks. Every few feet, there was another friend to catch up with; she discussed coming events with an Indonesian Consulate employee, and introduced a retired ambassador to customers.
