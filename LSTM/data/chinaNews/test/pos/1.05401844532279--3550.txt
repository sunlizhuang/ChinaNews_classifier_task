One of my last meals of the previous decade was at a newly opened Chinese restaurant in Mumbai. It was, not unlike the decade, underwhelming. The terrible communication and subpar service notwithstanding, it was the food that served as the final nail in the coffin. It tried too hard to be cool and experimental and, unsurprisingly, failed at being either. By the end of our meal, we wished we’d gone to a traditional favourite – Royal China or Ling’s Pavillion – and the remainder of the dinner was spent reminiscing of the Chinese restaurants of yore. Restaurants like Nanking that only exist in our collective memories and in odes such as these. As it turned out, all we were craving for was a taste of the familiar.

And so, the invitation for Hotel Shanghigh, the new Chinese restaurant in Mumbai, came as a pleasant surprise. Because the latest addition to Zorawar Kalra’s growing nightlife empire claimed to do exactly that – bring back retro Chinese, albeit not without its owner’s trademark flamboyance. At Shanghigh, Kalra attempts to bring together two somewhat diverse experiences. If the food is well within the comfort zone, Shanghigh’s performances are anything but. Kalra plans to have a routine of five every evening; each set getting more risqué as the hours pass by: international artists putting up outrageous shows – think walking on nails, climbing on swords, swinging things off eyelids and burlesque performances while you have your meal. The interiors have been designed for such a show – a runway and a stage cuts through the sitting area, while the bar on the other end keeps thirsty souls busy.

Long before American fast food chains hit the market, long before Italian and Continental were cool, there was Chinese food. It’s the one cuisine that has been such an integral part of our dining experience that it hardly qualifies as international anymore. “There’s a lot of repeatability to Chinese food. It’s comfort food; has been for an entire generation,” says Kalra sipping his trusty gin as he explains the rationale behind Shanghigh. For the most part, though, Kalra launched Shanghigh “because I was feeling like (eating) Chinese.” And so, at the heart of Shanghigh is its food. As promised, it does indeed hark back to the time when meals were simpler and no one looked down upon you because you didn’t blow nitrogen gas over your food.

The dumpling sampler

We start with the Chicken and Shitake Pot Sticker, butterfly-folded dumplings pan-seared and combined with a thin flat pancake garnished with burnt garlic and spring onion before moving to umami filled prawn in a crunchy spring roll wrap and crispy sesame-coated pork belly slices served with a heart black bean sauce, stir fried noodles and flash-fried haricot beans. The food kept coming at an impressive pace that only matched our speed at wiping the dishes clean. But the highlights were yet to arrive. Delicately smoked duck breast, with sweet and sour hoisin vinaigrette, was followed by oriental spiced tenderloin tossed in chilli soya sauce and whisky-tossed Mandarin chicken served on skewers atop sesame smoke (we’ll have two please).

Alongside, a steady stream of cocktails followed. Kalra says the cocktail menu is limited edition, which means by next month there’ll be a fresh set of cocktails and another reason to drop by. The evening was largely dedicated to gin cocktails, starting with a simple gin-and-soda before moving to one involving hibiscus tea and a lychee decoction.

Age of Invention

Vodka shots stirred with Campari, lime juice, rose water, and ginger ale were followed by the bar's centrepiece cocktail, The Great Emigration, with Baijiu at its base. Baijiu, a distilled spirit, is the world's most consumed liquor that's now making its way out of China and has only just arrived at bars in the country.

But it’s the dessert cocktail – served just as our food coma is setting in – that’s the pièce de résistance. The poetically named Mandate of Heaven has gin stirred with homemade limoncello, lavender syrup, and egg white topped with (yes!) marshmallow foam.

You’d be forgiven for thinking of Hotel Shanghigh as an (Oriental) Gatsbyesque space. It has all the trappings: the alcohol, the showgirls, the Roaring Twenties vibe. But take all of them away and you realise that at its very core of Hotel Shanghigh lies its food. That’s comfortable and repeatable. It’s what’ll keep you coming back for more.
