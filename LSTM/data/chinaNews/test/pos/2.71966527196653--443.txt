On Thursday, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly ratified the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, an update to the 1990s-era NAFTA deal. The new pact is largely similar to NAFTA but has some key provisions to support U.S. auto manufacturers, protect the environment and update intellectual property safeguards. U.S. dairy producers should also see increased exports, but the deal largely should leave commodities markets unaffected.

More crucially, on Wednesday, President Trump signed the Phase One Trade Agreement between the United States and China, a substantial move toward ending the trade war between the two countries.

The deal reduces some of the tariffs placed on Chinese goods in exchange for China updating its policies around intellectual property and agreeing to purchase more U.S. goods, especially farm products. Under the agreement, the Chinese are committing to nearly double their purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, which would be a substantial boost to U.S. farmers.

However, quickly after penning the deal, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said that China’s purchases would be driven by “market demand in China,” a worrying signal that they may not meet commitments.
