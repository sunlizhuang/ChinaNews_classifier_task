Quirky Chinese New Year ang baos in Singapore

You know what they say: It’s what’s on the inside that counts. And this holds true for Chinese New Year ang baos. But that doesn’t mean that the packaging should be neglected. If you want to be remembered this CNY as more than just the “random auntie/uncle who gives money every year”, take things up a notch with a fun and modern red packet.

It’s a win-win: The recipient will be pleasantly surprised, and you’ll immediately gain extra points with your relatives. They might even forgive you if you put just $4 inside. (But please, don’t do that.)

Here’s where you can get unique ang baos in Singapore with 3D, rat-themed, and bak kwa designs:

1. Watercolour-style with mouse-related puns

Easy on the eye with their colourful, light-toned illustrations, the mouse-themed money packets by local illustrator Kow Fong are certainly a less garish alternative to the usual red-and-gold ones. We love how the watercolour-style design evokes a sense of nostalgia, but holds modern whimsy at the same time.

See if you’re sharp enough to spot the 鼠 (mouse) puns incorporated into the scene!

There are also tote bags, drawstring bags, and cushion covers with the same design.

Price: $6.90 for 10 pieces

Get it via Delighting Ideas, Independent Market, or Grassroots Book Room.

2. Red bao-shaped hong bao

If you missed the subtle pun, this unorthodox round red packet from The Farm Store is a literal hong bao – i.e., a red bun. Except, instead of tau sar or char siew, this one unfurls to reveal something even better: Money. *ka-ching*



Image credit: The Farm Store

A set of 2 costs $9, while 3 sets (total 6 pieces) will cost you $18.90. Not exactly the cheapest, but they’ll sure bring the receiver a sense of novelty. Besides, these are all painstakingly folded by the inmates of Changi’s Women’s Prison, so you’ll be indirectly contributing to giving them a second chance when you purchase this.

3. “This is less than 1% of your COE”

This one’s for your rich cousin who technically doesn’t even need your ang bao, seeing as they can afford a whole car. After all, the amount you’re giving them is only less than 1% of their exorbitant COE, amirite?

These cheeky red packets by rudepacket take a lighthearted dig at them with the text “Congratulations, this is less than 1% of your COE” emblazoned across. It’s interesting to note that they’re wide enough to fit a $1,000 bill – not that most of us would readily part with such an amount.

They’re currently going at a discounted price of $8.40 (U.P. $12) for a set of 5.

Price: $8.40 for 5 pieces

Giving gets even sweeter this Lunar New Year if you get your red packets from Hope for Animals, because 50% of the proceeds are going to selected local dog shelters. There are a whopping 20 designs to choose from, ranging from cute and cartoon-like to more elaborate ones that look like they’ve been painted on.

Each variant features a different dog breed – including Papillon, Corgi, and Pomeranian – as well as well-wishes in Chinese.
