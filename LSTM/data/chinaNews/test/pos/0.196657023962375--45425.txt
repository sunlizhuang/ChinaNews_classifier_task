Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s intent to give a leg-up to the MSME sector fell short in enabling an environment that could spur investments by them.The minister announced a slew of measures for MSMEs , including the Government e-marketplace ( GeM ) moving forward to create a unified procurement system. Notable among the proposals were also amendments to the Factor Regulation Act 2011, which would allow NBFCs to participate in TReDS, thereby enhancing the financial sustainability of MSMEs. Among other proposals was a pan-India single-window clearance system for investments would come up to allow higher investments and ease of doing business in India to come in more seamlessly.Industry experts, though enthused by some of the initiatives announced by the FM, felt that the impact of the Budget on the MSME investment cycle will - at best - be muted.At the heart of what the MSME sector was looking for were proposals that could have encouraged investment and improved access to credit. In fact, this is not a new demand. Investments have been falling precipitously over the last few years, and access to credit has been a perennial problem. The Economic Survey of 2018 rightly pointed out that investment slowdowns are more detrimental to growth than saving slowdowns, a conclusion that was earlier reached by Rodrik (2000). However, the Budget seems have done little to break the inertia.Gaurav Anand, co-founder of fintech firm Namaste Credit said the limited major change proposed for MSME in the current budget is around increasing the tax audit threshold from a turnaround of Rs 1 crore to Rs 5 crore. This, he said, is more of a reduction in red-tapism and compliance for the micro and small enterprises. “It will free up resources and save costs for the businesses, but is not going to lead to any significant capex revival. Moreover, the implementation can be patchy and limited, as the condition attached for availing this tax audit exemption is limited to MSMEs who have only 5% cash sales,” he added.Adding to Anand’s views, Animesh Saxena, President, Federation of Indian Micro and Small & Medium Enterprises (FISME) said that while raising the statutory tax audit threshold from Rs 1 crore to 5 crore comes as a welcome relief for traders, the rider that the enterprises should not have more than 5% of turnover in cash will restrict its uptake.The Finance Minister in her budget also stated that more than five lakh MSMEs have benefitted from the restructuring of debt permitted by RBI last year. The restructuring window was to end on March 31, 2020 but the Government has asked the RBI to consider extending this window till March 31, 2021. Saxena, was, however, dissatisfied with the restructuring exercise and asked for a complete overhaul of the scheme.In her address the FM also added that GST had led to important benefits for MSMEs. The tax incidence on almost every commodity had come down substantially, Sitharaman had stated. But, businesses who are hit by the shoddy implementation of GST, did not get any tax relief.Mahendra K Sanghi, Chairman, M K Group of Companies, however, did not sound impressed. “There is no real tax benefit for MSMEs in the Budget. A lot of them are in the proprietorship or partnership model. There has been no reduction in corporate tax for them - they still constitute 48-50% of the business in the country,” he said.Experts from industry associations too remained non-committal on how the proposals could imply a manifold shift for the sector as far as investments were concerned. “I am not sure if all these measures will lead to more investment by SMEs just yet. It will provide a roadmap for the economy, but one will have to wait and see how things really turnaround. The proposal for investment clearance cell is there and is a positive move. However, I feel investors have multiple choices so the ease of relocation has to be made for them. Secondly, there should also be some tax predictability in the system,” said Ajay Sahai, DG and CEO of Federation of Indian Export Organisations ( FIEO ).Sahai lauded the move regarding NBFCs being a part of TReDS as beneficial and easing credit flow in the system. However, he said that a focus on R&D and innovation was amiss. “The announcements on the new economy were there, but no mention has been made on our R&D spending, which is the lowest in the world,” he asserted.Experts were categorical in their view that short-term investments by the sector seemed improbable at this time as sentiments are at an all time low. “People are wary and the government also needs to be consistent with its policies. CAA unrest is not helping anyone, neither is the China situation,” Mahavir Pratap Sharma, Past Chairman, Carpet Export Promotion Council ( CEPC ) said.He added that a lot depends on the process and documentation as far as the NBFC announcement is concerned for it to really make a dent in the system.Drawing attention to the GeM, Sharma said that it needs to be marketed outside India as well for it to scale up to a bigger level. “The announcements regarding GeM can imply great changes for the sector. It has the scope to virtually become an Alibaba of India for small and micro businesses. However, it needs to be promoted in international markets too.”Even if announcements fell short in getting businesses excited, FISME hailed the move of subordinate debt for MSMEs as proposed in the Budget. “This subordinate debt to be provided by banks would count as quasi-equity. As it will not be secured debt, it has been proposed to be fully guaranteed through the Credit Guarantee Trust for Medium and Small Entrepreneurs (CGTMSE). It will allow MSMEs to raise funds without bringing in additional collateral securities,” Saxena stated.It has been particularly difficult to conjure back the ‘animal spirits’, with investment decline continuing for a prolonged period of time. The Budget pushes back hopes even further.
