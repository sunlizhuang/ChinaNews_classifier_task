The booming sound of firecrackers popping signalled the beginning of Chinese New Year celebrations in Calgary on Saturday to welcome the Year of the Rat.

Hundreds gathered outside of the Calgary Chinese Cultural Centre in Chinatown to watch festive dragon and lion dance performances, listen to speeches and take in a traditional eye-dotting ceremony to “wake up” the colourful beings.

Speakers said the new animal in the zodiac represents prosperity, intelligence and resourcefulness.

“It has the ability to survive and prosper under the most adverse and challenging conditions,” said Malcolm Chow, president of the cultural centre.

“Alberta and Calgary have faced many challenges in the past few years — low oil prices, slow economy, difficulty in getting resources to the global market — but our little friend, the little (rat), should be our inspiration.”

Chow said the new year should inspire Calgarians to work together and lift themselves up by their bootstraps, as “our little friend” would.

Mayor Naheed Nenshi and United Conservative Party MLA Josephine Pon spoke about the many contributions of Chinese Albertans and the long-standing history of Chinatown in Calgary.

Nenshi also spoke about the symbolic meaning of the Year of the Rat.

“Alberta is officially one of the only rat-free jurisdictions in the entire world, but this is a rat that we welcome,” said Nenshi.

“If rats are present, that means there is grain in the silo, that means that there is prosperity and, so, that’s my wish for all of us this Year of the Rat, that we have a year of great prosperity — material prosperity, prosperity in our families, prosperity in our community.”

But while Calgarians enjoyed the joyful celebration in the streets of Calgary, many in China were forced to stay inside for the biggest celebration of the year in light of the coronavirus outbreak.

Xu Lu, Consul General of the People’s Republic of China in Calgary, spoke about the outbreak when she took the mic on Saturday.

“The beginning of this year was quite unusual. We are facing the challenges of a new virus,” said Lu. “As long as we work together we can overcome this disease and conquer it.”

Nenshi, drawing attention to Lu’s remarks, mirrored her sentiments and said that together, as a global community, we can look after all those affected.

“Our thoughts turn to the people in China today who are going to have a very different kind of celebration than they are used to,” he said.

Cody Tang, a line-dancer with the Jing Wo Cultural Association, said it’s heartbreaking some people in China won’t be able to celebrate the Chinese New Year like normal, but said they will still feel the energy that accompanies the celebrations.

“I know they can’t go out and spend it with their family or friends that live in different houses but, at least they can spend it together,” said Tang.

The first case of coronavirus in Canada was confirmed Saturday afternoon. Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto said they are caring for a patient who recently travelled to Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus originated.

The adult male is in stable condition and has been admitted to an isolation room.

Global authorities have confirmed more than 1,300 cases of the coronavirus and 41 people have died as of Saturday, with most of those deaths occurring in Wuhan.

Unprecedented lockdowns have been put in place in Wuhan, with a population of about 11 million, and neighbouring Huanggang, a city with some seven million people. Other cities have had transportation shut down.

Canadian health officials said Friday that mass coronavirus quarantines will not take place in Canada if the virus is discovered here. They also stressed authorities are better prepared than they were during the SARS outbreak in 2003 that killed 44 Canadians.
