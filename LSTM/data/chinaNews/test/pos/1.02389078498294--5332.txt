Taiwan heads into a crucial presidential and parliamentary poll today that will determine the future course of the young democracy’s relations with the United States and China.

After an election campaign that has been dominated by fears of Chinese interference and targeted disinformation operations, some 19 million eligible voters will decide between Tsai Ing-wen, 63, the incumbent president, and Han Kuo-yu, 62, the populist opposition candidate.

In broad terms, voters are being asked to choose between a closer relationship with Washington, represented by Ms Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party (DMT), or the stronger trade ties with neighbouring China favoured by Mr Han’s Kuomintang (KMT) Party.

Taiwan, an island of 23 million off the southeast coast of China, functions as a de facto independent nation with its own elections, currency and military. The majority of the population now identify as being Taiwanese.

However, China claims the Taiwan as its own territory and has pledged to annex its territory, using force if necessary. Beijing mistrusts President Tsai and used military and economic pressure to try to undermine her administration, while attempting to isolate Taiwan on the global stage.

After decades of martial law, Taiwan did not see its first direct presidential poll until 1996, and elections in Taiwan are a colourful and generally joyful affair.
