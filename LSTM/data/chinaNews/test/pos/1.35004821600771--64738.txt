Back in 2003/2004, I’d sit on my family couch at night watching whatever it was that Channel 5 was showing. Sometimes it would be local sitcoms, other times it was crappy international films. Yet I wasn’t interested in the programs; instead, every day I patiently waited for the random broadcasts of my favourite advertisement—the Phua Chu Kang Sar-vivor rap.

The first time I saw Gurmit Singh’s afro-wearing contractor and his giant mole pop up unannounced on the TV screen, it blew my tiny mind.

Opening with a shot of PCK in the booth, I thought Mediacorp had accidentally aired a Chinese New Year music video in the middle of the year. Then, almost immediately, an incredibly bouncy pop-rap beat kicked in, sending 7-year-old me into a dancing frenzy. Only years later did I realise the song was actually a parody of the 1997 Will Smith hit single Gettin’ Jiggy Wit It.

Acting as a public service announcement during the height of the SARS epidemic in Singapore, the song was the government’s way of appealing to every single demographic. PCK is a national icon that’s well-loved by all, and backing him up with an also iconic instrumental from the 90s only strengthened its quality as a song.





Though Mediacorp doesn’t make content like Sar-vivor anymore, possibly due to licensing issues, parodies have found a home amongst local content creators. The country’s biggest Youtuber, Jianhao Tan, got his start making song parodies , and the format is still as strong and prevalent as ever among Singapore’s Youtube community.

However, what separates Sar-vivor from amateur content is Gurmit Singh. His performance on the song is exceptional. Fully channelling the Phua Chu Kang persona that people have come to know and love, Gurmit’s charisma provides an infectious energy that masks the corny humour of the song. Even the excessive use of Singlish feels adorable rather than forced and forced, which is a hurdle that many Youtubers fail to overcome.

And of course, the SARS puns in the chorus and the insanely catchy ‘Use Your Brain’ hook was also a stroke of genius. Choosing to draw up new melodies instead of re-using Will Smith’s rap flow helped listeners form their own opinions rather than make comparisons to the original. It allowed the song to stand on its own as a fresh piece of content that Singaporeans could attach themselves to.

In comparison to classic National Day songs like One People, One Nation, One Singapore and Home—songs that aspire to inspire and instil a sense of nationalism—Sar-vivor is noticeably lacking in meaning and depth. It’s the kind of rap/song that might cause those unfamiliar with Singaporean culture to scratch their heads in confusion.

At the same time, it is also this full-blown embracing of Singapore’s peculiarities that makes the song lovable. It’s not glamorous, nor does it aim to be a high-brow piece of art that wants to impress. Instead, it’s a song that has fun with local mannerisms.
