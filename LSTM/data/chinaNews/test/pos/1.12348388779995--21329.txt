PETALING JAYA: The man behind the “Uninstall Hatred: Reboot Malaysia and Global Harmony” campaign is sending Chinese New Year greetings in multiple languages and in the Jawi script.



Datuk Hussamuddin Yaacub said he was delivering his e-greeting card in multiple languages to drive home an important point -- that differences in written symbols do not alter the meaning of the words.



“We still deliver the same message despite writing it in other languages,” said the chairman of the Karangkraf Media Group, which publishes Malay-language daily Sinar Harian.



Hussamuddin also signs off the e-card with his name written in Chinese characters.



“Writing my name in Chinese does not make me a Chinese, or any less a Malay.



“Likewise, writing in Jawi does not turn a non-Muslim into a Muslim,” he said.



His name is also spelt out in Chinese calligraphy in his e-card, showcasing the art of writing in roman with Chinese-like alphabets.



“That is the art of calligraphy,” he said, chiding those whom he said had created unnecessary tension over a proposal to teach khat or Jawi calligraphy in schools.



Hussamuddin took to task NGOs, politicians, and even religious preachers who appeared to have divided Malaysia’s multiracial rakyat by fanning unhealthy sentiments.



“No religion promotes hatred,” he said.



He called on fellow Malaysians to appreciate differences and to shed prejudices in order to continue enjoying a peaceful co-existence.



He also called on other players in the media industry as well as schools to continue promoting initiatives aimed at “uninstalling hatred” and “rebooting harmony” in the run-up to May 13.



“We need to overcome the fear factor associated with May 13 (that saw racial clashes in 1969).



“We can only put a stop to the minority hate preachers who continue to fan negative sentiments when the majority right-thinking people celebrate unity in diversity,” he said.



The aim was to promote harmony, celebrate differences, shed negative emotions, eliminate prejudice, and most importantly, discard hatred.



“All these can be achieved when every one of us embraces the Rukunegara, and respects each other,” he said.



Wishing the Chinese community a happy and prosperous New Year, Hussammuddin called on all Malaysians to start wishing each other well.



“We are Malaysians first,” he said.
