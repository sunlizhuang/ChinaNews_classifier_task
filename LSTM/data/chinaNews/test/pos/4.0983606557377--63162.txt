Historically, Beijing relied upon the neighbouring provinces of Hebei, Tianjin and Shandong for its seafood and other fresh produce, which because of the transportation involved were preserved using various drying methods. However, today with modern transportation, produce from Shandong can arrive in the markets in Beijing within a day and fresh catches such as sea bass are a prized restaurant dish. A particularly popular dish is steamed fish served in a soy and spring onion hot oil, which originated from southern China where steaming is a common cooking technique. I have made my version of steamed sea bass cooked with a beer sauce. Try it with rice and my garlic oyster mushrooms.
