There is this humdinger of a post by David Farrar about breaches of electoral law relating to donations.

He says this:

I blogged a few days ago that there was almost no doubt that electoral donation laws had been broken, and the only question was which ones. This is a very significant statement. The Electoral Commission could have just said these matters need further investigation. But they have categorically stated it is their belief that donation returns from NZ First broke the law. The job of the Police is to work out who is responsible. Basically NZ First were running a scheme to launder their donors through their foundation, and it has been declared illegal by the Electoral Commission. Will the Prime Minister suspend the Deputy Prime Minister as he is now under Police investigation? Of course not.

I thought I would borrow most of his words for this post. With a bit of tweaking the ill advised nature of the post becomes clear.

I blogged [16 months ago] that there was almost no doubt that electoral donation laws had been broken, and the only question was which ones.

This is a very significant statement. The [Serious Fraud Office] could have just said these matters need further investigation. But they have [laid charges]. The job of the [SFO] is to work out who is responsible.

Basically [National was involved in] a scheme to [hide the identity of a significant donor to the party].

Will [National] suspend [Simon Bridges for his involvement?] Of course not.

I don’t think that National is in a position to claim the moral high ground here. And from what I know of the situation the arrangement appears to be cute rather than illegal. Although representations made to the donors will need further investigation and analysis.

But they will go to town on this. And hope that when the identities of the four persons charged are released none of them have current associations with the National Party.

After all isn’t this what Simon Bridges has said?

Please no speculation about who these people are. They have rights of privacy up to the time the Court determines their details should not be suppressed.
