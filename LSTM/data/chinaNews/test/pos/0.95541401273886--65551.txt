“Once again, this budget proposal is woefully out of touch when it comes to protecting America’s interests by calling for cuts of nearly a quarter of our footprint around the world. Given the growing threats from the coronavirus to the rise of China and other great powers, to ongoing instability from Venezuela to Yemen and beyond, now is not the time to take our diplomats and development tools off the playing field.

As Congress now takes the reins on spending decisions, we urge lawmakers to follow their bipartisan playbook from the past three years – rejecting these dangerous cuts – and support $60 billion to ensure critical resources for the State Department, USAID, and other development agencies to keep our nation safe and promote America’s interests around the world.”
