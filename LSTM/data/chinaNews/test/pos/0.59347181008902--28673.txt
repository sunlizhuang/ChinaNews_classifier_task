These cold winter days can be brutal for LA ice cream shops, with Brooklyn-based Ample Hills Creamery announcing yesterday that it would close its flagship Los Feliz scoop shop after 15 months of business. The company converted a gorgeous bungalow in Los Feliz into an ice cream wonderland in October 2018, with a warm reception from the neighborhood. Still, the area had a glut of premium ice cream, from Jeni’s and Supercool Creamery to the now-closed McConnell’s.

In an Instagram post on the closure, Ample Hills Creamery did say that it hoped to find another footing somewhere in the Southern California area, saying “we continue to look forward to existing and new expansion opportunities in the Southern California market and promise to stay in touch.” Anyone got a space for them?
