Rinchen Ato has always been something of a perfectionist. Born in Cambridge, she studied fine art at A-Level and developed a precise and hyper-realistic style of drawing. “But I was always frustrated that I wasn’t good enough and ended up dropping out spectacularly,” she recalls. A year later, she went back and re-took her final school year, this time concentrating instead on photography. “I found I could focus on the subject instead of my own incompetence,” she says. “Plus, I drew in this really lifelike way, so photography was a better medium anyway.”

Rinchen went on to study Photographic Arts and for a while thought she might want to be a documentary photojournalist in the Don McCullin mould, shooting “important”, honest stories. But it didn’t take long for the reality of this life to dawn on her. “I remember watching a documentary about [McCullin] and he said, ‘You can file away and archive those negatives, but the memories never leave you.’ He looked haunted. I decided I couldn’t live my life with that same kind of haunting.”

After university, Rinchen went on to work for a photography agency, and this profession enabled her to fund her own personal photography projects. “I decided not to compromise on my photography,” she explains. “I would do it my way. I didn’t want a creative director hanging over me. And anyway, the stuff I’m interested in wasn’t really getting commissioned anymore.”

One of those personal projects has been ongoing for the best part of two decades and is especially close to her heart. It has involved multiple trips to Tibet, the birth country of her father, Ato Rinpoche, whose story is an extraordinary one. Rinchen’s father was discovered early in his life as a lama (a spiritual leader in Tibetan Buddhism) and grew up in a monastery, but at the start of Chinese Communist rule in 1959, he fled to India. While in exile he met and fell in love with Rinchen’s mother, gave up monastic life, and moved to England, where Rinchen was born in the early 80s.

Since she was two years old, Rinchen has been travelling to Tibet, both with her father and alone, and for the past two decades has been photographing the monasteries and communities of Kham, in the province of Qinghai. Over the years, she has built up an astounding body of work, hundreds of photos shot in medium format, lovingly documenting the religious practices, customs and lives of the people in rural Tibet.
