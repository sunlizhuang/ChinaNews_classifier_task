Green cars were the dominant theme at the India’s biggest motor show 2020.

The dominant theme of the 15th edition of the biennial India Auto Expo 2020, India's biggest motor show, at the sprawling India Expo Mart in Greater Noida, near Delhi, was clearly electric vehicles.

At present, there are about 4,000 electric cars on Indian roads, which is just about 0.1 per cent of the close to 3.5 million cars sold last fiscal. Auto honchos said the opportunity is big if only the charging stations come up throughout the country.

However, undeterred the Chinese automakers queued up to take over the Indian mart, which is the world's fourth largest automobile market despite temporary slowing economy and slumping sales for a year and half.

Sale of automobiles declined almost 15 per cent in 2019, the worst in over a decade. The impact of the downturn was felt at the motor show with a host of regular participants like Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Audi, Jaguar Land Rover, BMW & Mini and almost all of the two wheeler industry giving it a miss this time.

Yet, there were many new entrants as well from across the border in China. Auto honchos hope, the lure of the new models will create excitement that will help revive consumer sentiment.

Maruti Suzuki, India's biggest car maker, made its global premiere of electric concept vehicle Futuro-E at the event. Futuro-e introduces cars in a coupe-styled SUV model. The concept falls under 'Mission Green Million' initiative that focuses on selling green cars (CNG, hybrids and electric).

“The concept Futuro-e will introduce a fresh global design perspective to the Indian automobile landscape. The car is an electric SUV-coupe defined by its bold and sporty characteristics,” Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director at Maruti Suzuki, said.

He said concept Futuro-e has been conceptualized and designed in India by its young and bright team.

It's rival Mahindra and Mahindra, the third largest car maker and the first Indian car maker that launched electric cars in the country, launched eKUV100, an electric compact SUV priced at ` 8.25 lakh. The car gets the all-new power train called mStallion that produces peak power output of 40kW and maximum torque of 120Nm. Mahindra claims that the car can go up to 147KM in single charge. The homegrown company has also promised two more EVs - XUV300 at an estimated price tag of ` 10 -13 lakh and Atom, the compact electric car for last mile connectivity. We don't know when it would be launched.
