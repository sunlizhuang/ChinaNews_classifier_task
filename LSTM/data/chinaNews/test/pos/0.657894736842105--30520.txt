The Immigration and Emigration Department has halted the practice of issuing on-arrival visas to Chinese nationals.

An immigration official stated that the measures was taken on a recommendation made by the Health Ministry.

He explained that about 700 to 800 Chinese nationals arrived in the country on a daily basis and it was difficult to keep track of all of them. The measure to stop the issuing of on-arrival visa was taken as a result.

The official said Chinese nationals will no longer be able to travel to the country and obtain a visa on arrival. They will instead have to apply for a visa online from China itself. He added that the Immigration Department will also be able to identify which province of China the traveler is applying to travel to the country from.
