BEIJING, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- The China Foreign Languages Publishing Administration will partner with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to translate and release the Esperanto version of the Courier magazine in China.

At the signing ceremony held Tuesday, Fang Zhenghui, deputy director of the China Foreign Languages Publishing Administration, expressed his hope for the Esperanto version to contribute to the spread of UNESCO's messages.

The Courier was founded in 1948 with the aim to spread the messages of UNESCO and build a platform for dialogue among civilizations.

Esperanto was created by Polish doctor Lazaro Ludoviko Zamenhof in 1887 and was introduced to China in the early 1990s.
