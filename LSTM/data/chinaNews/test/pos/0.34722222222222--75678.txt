Now it has been revealed that there is a "small number" of other Irish passengers on board the cruiser.

There is also a number of Irish passengers on board another ship, the MS Westerdam, off Cambodia.

Between both luxury cruise ships, RTE understands thatten Irish people have been quarantined due to the virus.

Speaking on Morning Ireland, Coveney said: "We have a number of very sensitive consular cases on the Princess Diamond which is moored off Japan.

"There is also a second cruise ship off Cambodia, the Westerdam, and we're working with Irish nationals on both of those ships with a view to making sure that they're safe.

"If they need to be brought home, we can co ordinate that and if they need medical attention that they get that and if they're in quarantine that the conditions are safe.

'CONFIDENTIAL'

"The number of people who have been held on the Princess Diamond in a quarantine situation that ends tomorrow and we are talking to other EU partners about how and if we should be bringing our citizens home.

"I don't want to get into too much detail because I think people do deserve confidentiality when they're dealing with our consular services.

"We're dealing with each case individually as we should and we're dealing with those cases respecting the confidentiality of the people involved.

The outgoing Tanaiste also said the Department has evacuated six people from the Hubei province in China with the help of the UK.

He said: "Again the numbers were low but we worked with EU partners, with the UK in fact, to ensure that we have brought six people home from that province now on two different flights provided by the UK.
