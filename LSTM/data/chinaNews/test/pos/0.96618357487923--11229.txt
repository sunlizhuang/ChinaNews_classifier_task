BEIJING, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi held talks with visiting Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza here Thursday.

Wang said facts have proved that the "Monroe Doctrine" has long been outdated, sanctions and pressure are unpopular and there is no way out to impose external solutions.

"China will continue to firmly support Venezuela in safeguarding national sovereignty and dignity and safeguarding its legitimate rights and interests," Wang said.

China stands ready to work with the international community, in line with the basic norms of international relations, to continue to promote peace and talks and to play a constructive role in pushing the Venezuelan issue into an inclusive political settlement as soon as possible, he added.

Arreaza said Venezuela attaches great importance to its relations with China and is willing to deepen practical cooperation with China, strengthen communication and coordination, adhere to multilateralism, oppose power politics and push the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries to a new level.
