It has been purchased by John Shaw and some partners who own the Red Carpet Car Wash in Perry Township.

JACKSON TWP. After 33 years managing a single car wash, Jon Shaw found himself the owner of six in a single day.

Shaw and some partners already owned Red Carpet Car Wash in Perry Township. They acquired the five Dad's Car Care locations in late November from Steve Dimos, who launched the chain in 1996.

Last summer, Dimos decided to exit the business and approached Shaw about buying the local chain. Shaw lined up his partners — wife, Jennifer; son, Matthew; and longtime employees Justin and Tiffany Hurst — and made the deal happen.

Shaw has been in the car wash business 42 years since taking a part-time job while attending the University of Akron. Shaw started at a car wash operated by the former Sohio gasoline chain (now BP), and landed a full-time manager job. He then became a regional supervisor.

In the mid-1980s, Shaw began talking with private car wash operators and in 1986 put together a deal to buy Mike's Car Wash at 4546 Tuscarawas St. W in Perry Township. He renamed the place Red Carpet Car Wash.

Justin and Tiffany Hurst met while employees at Red Carpet and later married. "It's the classic story of working your way up through a small company," Shaw said of how the Hursts became his business partners.

Buying the Dad's Car Care centers comes at a time when there are plenty of changes happening in the local car wash market.

"The car wash business is going crazy right now," Shaw said.

In November, Patriot Car Wash opened at 2707 Tuscarawas St. W in Canton. The new facility is a drive-thru and has 13 bays with free vacuums.

In Perry Township, the Waikem Motors dealership opened a Froggies car wash and is eyeing several more locations in the area for new facilities. The Progressive Auto Group in Massillon has opened a car wash and has plans for a second site in North Canton.

Shaw cites technology that allows car wash owners to sell monthly wash plans, which guarantee a steady revenue stream. Capital venture groups are aware of the revenue stream and see car wash facilities as a solid investment when compared with retail stores, Shaw said.

The automated systems allow corporations to operate the car washes with fewer employees. Shaw said that won't happen with Red Carpet or the Dad's locations. He already has doubled the number of employees at the Dad's Car Care centers — up to more than 60 — and has 40 people who work at Red Carpet.

Shaw said he wants the locations fully staffed with employees who can answer questions and assist customers. "We'll still have personalized service," he said.
