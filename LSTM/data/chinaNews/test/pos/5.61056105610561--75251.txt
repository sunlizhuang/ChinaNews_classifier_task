Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) will dedicate two ships to humanitarian efforts in Australia and California to support some of the people affected by recent crises.

RCL chairman and CEO Richard Fain said Royal Caribbean was working with its suppliers to deliver one million N-95 protective masks into China for government distribution to affected areas.

Spectrum of the Seas will travel to Australia and be deployed on complimentary cruises sailing from Sydney in support of Australia’s first responder community, who worked tirelessly over many weeks of the bushfire crisis.

“We are in a fortunate position to offer these brave and selfless members of the Australian community the opportunity to join us for a few days and let them relax and unwind in the company of other volunteers and first responders,” said Michael Bayley, president and CEO of Royal Caribbean International (RCI). “By welcoming and accommodating them aboard Spectrum of the Seas, we hope to recognise their contribution and offer them our hospitality.”

Bayley noted that the ship and its crew have not been in China for more than two weeks, exceeding public health guidelines.

And when circumstances improve, Bayley said, RCI will dedicate a ship in China to a series of complimentary sailings to thank first responders and medical personnel for their heroic efforts to defeat the virus.

In addition, Celebrity Millennium is repositioning to the west coast of the US earlier than previously scheduled and will offer a series of Cruising for Heroes sailings in support of California firefighters, other first responders, and veterans throughout March and April.

A variety of three-, four- and five-night sailings, which will leave from Los Angeles, have been added to the brand’s offerings to travel the Pacific Coast.
