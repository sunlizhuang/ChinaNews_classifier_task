Every years, the brightest stars of the film industry gather for the Academy Awards. With the Academy getting close to celebrating 100 years of awards, this year will be another spectacular event. But to prepare for the ceremony, how can fans watch the films nominated?

This is the second year Oscar-nominated films have come from studios linked to streaming platforms, with Netflix being one of the main studios to have films nominated. Two of its films have been nominated for Best Picture: The Irishman and Marriage Story. READ MORE: Oscars 2020 nominations list: The FULL list of nominees for this year’s Academy Awards

Oscars 2020: How to watch the Oscar nominated movies - Full list

Along with that, The Two Popes stars Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce have been nominated for acting gongs, making that another must-see. The Irishman is Martin Scorsese’s epic movie starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, and is a staggering three and a half hours long, following the life of a hitman involved in the mafia during the 1960s. Meanwhile, The Two Popes sees Pope Benedict (played by Hopkins) and Pope Francis (Pryce) in a fictionalised conversation ahead of Benedict’s eventual decision to leave the papacy. In stark contrast, Marriage Story is a subtle romantic drama following a couple who are divorcing while living on other sides of the USA.

Marriage Story is full of drama and upset for both sides of the relationship, with Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson both nominated for their work. Other than the big films, Netflix has also worked on some documentaries which are available to stream on the platform. The Edge of Democracy, a documentary which delves into the issues surrounding the rise of populism and the abuse of power in politics, is available to stream, while the Obama-produced documentary American Factory is also available. This documentary follows the opening of a new Fuyao factory in Ohio, with it showing the culture clash between the American employees of the former General Motors plant with the Chinese workers.
