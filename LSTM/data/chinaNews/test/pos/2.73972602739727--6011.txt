Vice-Premier Hu Chunhua met with French Minister of Economy and Finance Bruno Le Maire at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing on Jan 10. Hu said Chinese President Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron exchanged visits last year, and the two sides have released an action plan on China-France ties, paving the way for further cooperation.

Together with France, China will implement the consensus reached by the two leaders, increase cooperation in areas such as civil nuclear power, reform of the World Trade Organization, animal disease control and 5G technology, Hu said.

He also hoped France would provide a fair business environment for Chinese enterprises.

Le Maire said France is willing to maintain close high-level exchanges with China and promote pragmatic cooperation, enhance communication and coordination on international affairs and safeguard multilateralism.
