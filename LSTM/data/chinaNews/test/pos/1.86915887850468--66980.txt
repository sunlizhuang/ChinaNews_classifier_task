Health Minister Yaakov Litzman issued a reminder in a video that anyone returning from China must be in isolation for 14 days. Additionally, "If you have returned from Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Macau or Thailand and you are not feeling well - you should be checked and notify the hospital or health fund [of your status] before arriving."
