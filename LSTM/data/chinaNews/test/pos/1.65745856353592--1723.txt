CANTON -- Program partners from the St. Lawrence County Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership (STL-CEL) recently accepted a $5,000 check from Community Bank NA, said a press release from the center.

The donation represents a commitment in support of the new entrepreneur development program, the press release said.

Meeting once a week during the 7-month program, STL-CEL participants explore new methods for business growth in a confidential, noncompetitive environment with assistance from fellow classmates, exceptional facilitators and external business experts.

Funds received from Community Bank and other program sponsors help ensure the long-term sustainability of the STL-CEL in support of area business leaders, the press release said.
