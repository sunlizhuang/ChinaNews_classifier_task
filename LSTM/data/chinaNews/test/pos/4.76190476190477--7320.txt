First up is Park's BBQ, which was established in 2003. Located at 955 S. Vermont Ave., the Korean barbecue restaurant stands out among the local businesses that are popular with your neighbors. While the average eatery has only three Nextdoor recommendations, Park's BBQ has racked up 21 and was voted a 2019 Neighborhood Favorite business by locals.

Owner and chef Jenee Kim, a South Korea native, blends traditional Korean cuisine with "her inventive view on flavors" and maintains a commitment to high-quality ingredients, according to the eatery's website.

Stop by the restaurant for everything from bulgogi and kimchi stew to American wagyu rib-eye steak and seasoned pork belly.

Olympic Blvd., has been featured on the travel and food show "Parts Unknown," in which the late Anthony Bourdain said the soup will "make you forget every bad thing that you ever thought about tofu."
