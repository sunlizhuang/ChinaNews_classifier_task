On Dec. 21, 2019, Chinese Family Network, a small nonprofit organization, hosted a social event at the J.V. Fletcher Library in Westford for families in the local Asian community. The event included an art-and-craft program for young children and their parents, and a social gathering for seniors, attracting attendees from three generations.

The art-and-craft program for children was held in the main meeting room on the first floor. The program welcomed a crowd of 75 people from more than 20 families. The children enjoyed making clay art, drawing and coloring at the crafts stations operated by five volunteers from local high schools.

In addition to making art, children watched a holiday-themed short movie and hung out with an air-blown snowman. Plus, they received a surprise visit by Santa Claus, who handed out Christmas treats along with two cheerful helpers.

The event, like most events organized by CFN, was a collaborative effort between CFN staff, volunteers, local artists and families to bring culture and art to the local communities. Most of the volunteers are parents, many of whom had been with the organization since 2016. However, this event was supported by five high-school volunteers who ran the show and stayed the entire afternoon.

The volunteers, Rory Li, Christina Tran, Caroline Neward, Maliha Parikh and Mairead Ouellette not only taught children how to make cute animals with colorful clay but also helped putting up the crafts stations and cleaning things up.

Creations of the children were put on display in the exhibit box outside of the meeting room until late January.

Another gathering was on the third floor, where seniors enjoyed chess, mahjong and other card games. This smaller group joked about losing memories, color-coded pills and complained about increasingly harsh winters. But above all, they enjoyed spending time with friends, new or old.

The two-gathering event was the third end-of-year social event organized by CFN, thanks to the support from the Westford Cultural Council. Since 2016, CFN has worked with local libraries and other entities to organize events for Asian families in local communities. Past events include an Asian-themed concert, moon festival story times, a childrenâ€™s art show, poetry recitation and Lunar New Year celebration.
