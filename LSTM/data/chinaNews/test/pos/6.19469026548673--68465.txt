9 Spokes strengthens Asia Pacific presence with new senior vice-president

9 Spokes International Ltd (ASX:9SP) has strengthened its board through the appointment of Audrey Chia as a new Asia Pacific (APAC) senior vice-president.

Chia, who will be based in Singapore, brings extensive experience managing global account and partnerships, most recently as the Gap Partnership APAC head of strategic partnerships.

9 Spokes chief executive officer Adrian Grant said he was delighted to welcome Audrey Chia to the team.

"Her appointment comes at an exciting time for the company as we expand our global footprint."



"Establishing a physical presence"

Grant said: "With a foothold already established in Singapore through our OCBC partnership, and with progress made towards entering Malaysia, this is an opportune time for us to establish a physical presence in the APAC region - to meet the needs of our client OCBC and to drive momentum with other banks.

"Audrey's experience of the market positions us well to drive our business."
