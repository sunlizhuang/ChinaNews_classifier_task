Princess Diana’s niece has joined the Queen’s grandson in exploiting royal connections to promote milk sales in China.

A day after the Mail exposed Peter Phillips’ lucrative commercial work in Shanghai, it emerged that Lady Kitty Spencer has got in on the act too. The pair are going head to head by plugging rival Chinese dairy brands.

Endorsing Satine Jersey milk, Earl Spencer’s daughter posed in a stunning emerald dress with a cup of tea for a photoshoot at the British Museum.

The 29-year-old model, a first cousin to Princes William and Harry, said she was thrilled, telling Chinese journalists: ‘The day of the Royal Family usually begins with a cup of milk or a cup of tea.’

Lady Kitty’s involvement emerged as:

The Cabinet Office was urged to probe Peter Phillips’ blatant trading on his royal status;

MPs condemned Princess Anne’s son for ‘demeaning the very essence of the monarchy’;

A former royal chef derided his claim that Mr Phillips was ‘brought up on Jersey milk from the herd at Windsor’;

Buckingham Palace came under pressure to explain why it allowed his advert;

Prince Harry arrived in Canada to embark on his own life of ‘financial independence’.

On Tuesday, the Mail revealed that Mr Phillips, who with his Canadian wife Autumn sold their 2008 wedding to Hello! magazine, had appeared in two adverts for a Chinese state-owned dairy firm.

Dressed in a black bow tie and dinner jacket, the 42-year-old said in a dubbed Chinese voice ‘I love to drink Jersey Milk’ while a caption read ‘British Royal Family member Peter Phillips’.

He is likely to have been paid tens of thousands of pounds for the adverts, which give the impression of being set in a royal palace.

The two aristocrats effectively went head to head in a milk marketing war because their rival promotions were both launched in June last year

In fact the scenes use footage from Longleat House in Wiltshire. The stately home did not give permission for this.

Yesterday, it emerged that Princess Diana’s niece has been promoting a rival brand, Satine, which is sold by Chinese food giant Yili Group.

It competes in the growing Chinese market for ‘high end’ milk against Jersey Cattle Fresh Milk, the product that is being marketed by the Queen’s grandson.

The two aristocrats effectively went head to head in a milk marketing war because their rival promotions were both launched in June last year. The rival brands bill themselves as milk from Jersey cows, a key selling-point for Chinese middle-class consumers.

Dozens of photographs were taken of Lady Kitty, whose dress was designed with a nod to Far Eastern couture, at the Satine launch event on June 8.

With the grand backdrop of the British Museum’s marble atrium, Lady Kitty sipped tea while a Chinese woman poured milk from a carton – with the title ‘Satine Jersey Milk British Museum Classic Edition’ – into a jug.

The milk carton is emblazoned with ‘Satine – The British Museum’ and features a sketch based on an 1846 lithograph of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert with their children, titled The Royal Children in the Nursery

A press release issued by the milk company made great play of her royal connections, saying: ‘Kitty Spencer, niece of the late Princess Diana, made an authentic English breakfast tea with Jersey milk and shared the story of Jersey milk and the British Royal Family.’

Lady Kitty, who is not a member of the Royal Family, was quoted as saying: ‘Jersey milk has a close relationship with the British Royal Family. At Buckingham Palace, the official residence of the Queen in London, the Queen’s day begins with drinking a cup of tea.

‘Jersey milk has been enjoyed by the British Royal Family for many years. Jersey milk is considered to be the finest and most special from the United Kingdom.’

The launch event led to gushing articles in the Chinese media about Satine milk and ‘British noble member’ Lady Kitty.

The eldest child of Earl Spencer, Lady Kitty grew up in South Africa with her mother, Victoria, the peer’s first wife.

She has been based in London for five years since signing with Storm Management, the modelling agency which launched the careers of Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne.

Lady Kitty made her runway debut for Dolce & Gabbana in 2017, has modelled for the Italian luxury jewellery brand Bulgari, and has graced the covers of Tatler and Harper’s Bazaar.

Diana’s niece posted on her Instagram feed a photo of herself at the launch of Satine milk, writing: ‘Paid partnership with British Museum. A fascinating morning learning and speaking at the Satine x British Museum Limited Edition Launch Event’.

In a promotional video, she added: ‘Hello, I’m Kitty Spencer, and I’m thrilled to be here to celebrate the collaboration between the British Museum and Satine.’

The British Museum received a fee for hosting the event, which it said was ‘commercially sensitive’.

A spokesman said: ‘The British Museum started its brand licensing programme back in 2016 and has an international programme, with select licensee partners in China, the UK, Europe and North America.

‘The press release details the collaboration on this particular product and the role of the British Museum, whereby the design of the packaging for a specific product was inspired by objects in the British Museum’s collection.’

This is a reference to the milk carton that is emblazoned with ‘Satine – The British Museum’ and features a sketch based on an 1846 lithograph of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert with their children, titled The Royal Children in the Nursery.

A copy of the original artwork is in the Royal Collection.

Yesterday there was no comment from Lady Kitty’s agent or from Buckingham Palace.

Mr Phillips declined to comment. But a source close to him said: ‘As Peter does not undertake any Royal duties and does not receive any income from the tax payer, he is entitled to go about his business and earn a living.’

Lady Kitty is newly engaged to South African businessman Michael Lewis who, at 60, is five years older than her father, Earl Spencer.

She has been at a fashion show in Paris over the past few days, sporting a dazzling diamond ring believed to be worth up to £300,000.
