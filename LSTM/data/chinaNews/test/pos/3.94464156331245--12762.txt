WILMINGTON, Del. — The LYCRA Company, a global leader in developing innovative solutions for the textile, apparel and personal care industries, is marking its first anniversary as a stand-alone subsidiary of the Ruyi Group on January 31.

In 2020, The LYCRA Company is operating at full strength across all facets of the organization and sharpening its focus to create value through strategic investments in science and technology as innovation is a key enabler to the company’s future success. The company is also actively exploring potential synergies with Ruyi, its majority shareholder, which include leveraging its spandex capacity and fully integrated value chain.

“Ruyi has been a strong partner that understood the challenges we faced as a new business, including the impact global economic trends had on our business performance,” said Dave Trerotola, CEO of The LYCRA Company. “This transition year also gave us plenty of wins as we built a strong foundation for future growth by continuing our heritage of investing in innovation.”

The LYCRA Company recently opened a new state-of-the-art research and development lab in Foshan, China, and launched several exciting new solutions designed to add value to collections and meet consumer needs for lasting comfort and performance.

The company expanded its EcoMade portfolio of sustainable products, broke new ground with its first print technology offering, and is ready to revolutionize apparel fit again with a new fiber that stretches to fit more body shapes within a size range. Products launched include:

LYCRA ® EcoMade fiber is the company’s first branded spandex that offers the same performance as the original LYCRA ® fiber, but is made with pre-consumer recycled content.
