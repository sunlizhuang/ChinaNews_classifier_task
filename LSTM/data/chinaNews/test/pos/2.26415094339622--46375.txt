Derby students were told via email that some of their peers had been isolated after returning from China.

The University of Derby sent the message to its students on Thursday evening.

In an email seen by Derbyshire Live, the university told its students that it is monitoring advice from Public Health England on the outbreak.

It then said: "Key staff from various departments are meeting regularly to ensure we are at the forefront of news and will continue to closely monitor the status.

"We do have some students that have recently returned to the UK from Wuhan. Following the advice from Public Health England and WHO (World Health Organisation) they have been isolated.

"They will remain isolated for 14 days. We are fully supporting the students through this and they are being provided with all necessary supplies. Student Wellbeing and their family and friends are communicating with them."

The email added: "Importantly please respect and support each other.

"Here at Derby we are proud of our diverse and inclusive student population. Please be mindful of any comments regarding this virus and be supportive of your fellow peers."

It advised students to continue their normal routine and attend lectures and seminars as normal and encouraged them to check emails regularly.

Three students who returned from Wuhan before the travel ban was imposed are currently in "self-isolation".

Fifteen others remain in China, a spokesperson confirmed.
