LOUD squeals of delight broke out when a pair of oxen yoked to a bullock cart trotted into the compound of SJK(T) Jalan Sungai during a Ponggal celebration.

Several children, teachers and parents were then seen taking turns to go on a bullock cart ride.

The Ponggal event drew 115 pupils and teachers of the school in George Town, Penang.

Joining them were 36 pupils and teachers from SJK(C) Sum Sun, SJK(C) Moh Ghee Pusat and SJK(C) Moh Ghee Cawangan, who were invited to experience the celebration.

SJK(C) Sum Sun pupil Khoo Boo Sern, 11, was among those taking a bullock cart ride around the school compound.

“I was not scared at all. Instead, I was happy and it was so much of fun going on the bumpy ride, ” he said.

Hosted by the school, the event was jointly organised with Malaysia Hindu Sangam, Penang Hindu Association, the school’s board of governors, Parent-Teacher Association and parents.

School headmistress K. Anjalay Devi said the bullock cart ride was a surprise.

“We wanted to make Ponggal merrier this year so the children will go back home with happy memories.

“This is our third year holding the Ponggal celebration at the school and we wanted to share our happiness with our friends from the three Chinese primary schools.

“Ponggal is a harvest festival held to mark the start of the Tamil Thai month when we thank all the five elements of nature and the farmers for cultivating the soil.

“This celebration also promotes the culture of living together in harmony, ” she said.

The pupils, teachers and parents also took part in the cooking of sweet rice in earthen pots over small fire pits.

As the milk started boiling, all those gathered around the pits started shouting “Ponggolo Ponggal” and when the milk started overflowing, they added rice, brown sugar, nuts and raisins into the pot.

“The overflowing milk symbolises abundance of blessings, ” said Anjalay.

Friends Yeoh Qian Hong and Teh Yu Hong from SJK(C) Moh Ghee Pusat, both 11, said they now know what the Ponggal celebration is about.

They added that they were eager to try the sweet rice and take part in all the other activities which were painting and decorating the earthen pots, making thoranam (hanging decorations made from tender coconut leaf blades) and flower tying.

Ng Jia Ting and Ch’ng Rue Ying, both 11, who were seen engrossed in painting an earthen pot, said they had fun at the event.

“We also learnt a lot about Ponggal and why it is celebrated by our Indian friends, ” said Jia Ting.

SJK(C) Sum Sun teacher Chan Hui Leng said the celebration was an eye opener for the pupils from the Chinese schools as they learnt about a different culture.

“They were initially shy but once they warmed up, they quickly made friends and enjoyed themselves thoroughly, ” she said.

The children, teachers and parents later tucked into a vegetarian lunch served on banana leaf as part of the school’s go green initiative.

The pupils from the Chinese schools were encouraged to use their fingers to enjoy the meal better.
