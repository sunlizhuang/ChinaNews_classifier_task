It's been a busy day for the fleet. King Neptune has been dashing between the teams to test the equator crossing newbies and then bestowing them with shellback status, a badge of honour to savour forever.

And three teams successfully crossed the Scoring Gate first, awarding them bonus points to stash away.

Equator crossing ceremonies saw the creation of ten turtle tattoos (Imagine your Korea), poems and interpretive dance (Seattle), confessing of sins and crimes (WTC Logistics, Zhuhai and Unicef), and porridge blessings (Qingdao).

Ha Long Bay, Viet Nam was the first team through the Scoring Gate, scooping itself three bonus points and sees the team creeping ever closer towards Qingdao in the overall standings.

Second to cross was WTC Logistics, scoring its first ever points for a Scoring Gate. And getting to the gate in third place was Dare To Lead, who celebrated with a combined Scoring Gate and equator crossing party.
