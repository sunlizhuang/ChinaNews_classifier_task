Looking for quality ingredients to add to your reunion dinner this Lunar New Year?

Check out Far Ocean’s warehouse sale, with deals up to 70% off for high-value items such as grouper, pomfret, scallops, wagyu beef, kurobuta pork and many more! On top of that, hamper sets from S$88 onwards can be purchased, as well as a wide array of alcohol to pick from for the upcoming festive occasion.

The Far Ocean X Taste CNY Warehouse Sale is running at two locations this year—Far Ocean’s warehouse at Jurong Fishery Port & Raffles Holland V Mall.

The warehouse sale at Jurong Fishery Port runs from 9am – 5pm on weekdays, and on 18 & 19 January 2020, expect a line-up of cooking workshops conducted by local celebrity and former Love 972 DJ Dongfang Billy.

An exclusive selection of sale items will also be available at Taste Singapore at Raffles Holland V from now till 8 February 2020, as well as online at www.taste.farm.com.

For health-conscious individuals out there, try the Healthy Salmon & Fresh Fruit Yu Sheng (S$48.80). With a ton of fruits and ingredients—salmon (eight pieces), green apple, red apple, snow pear, blueberry, blackberry, raspberry, strawberry, rockmelon, kiwi, lychee, longan, pomelo, this is a blessing to those who love fruity flavours!

I personally do not like extremely fruity flavours, hence after trying this yu sheng at Taste Singapore, I found it too citrusy for my liking, but for those who love fruits, do give this a try.

Items like the Japanese Miyazaki Wagyu Beef A4 (100g) which is a Chinese New Year exclusive, is now priced at S$20 from the original price which was at S$28.

This meat, used in shabu-shabu hotpot, is tender with a slight amount of fat to it. Pair it with kombu soup to add flavour to your wagyu beef.

I had it without any sauce, and with every bite of the beef and a sip of the kombu broth, it releases a pleasant umami flavour.

Head on down to either of the two locations to snag some must have this Chinese New Year!
