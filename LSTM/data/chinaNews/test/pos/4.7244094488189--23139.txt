On the weekend of Jan. 11-12, the Sisters of Life, a contemplative/active religious community of women founded for the protection and enhancement of the sacredness of every human life, spoke during all the masses at the Church of St. Stephen, the First Martyr.

In 1991 the Sisters of Life were established by the inspiration and support of John Cardinal O’Connor. And since then, the community has grown to serving in locations across the globe including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Spain and the Philippines.

During their visit, the nuns invited women of all ages to participate in a Feminine Genius Brunch with the Sisters of Life to be held at 10 a.m. on Saturday, Feb. 22, at the Hilton Pearl River in Rockland County.

The event is held regionally and is sponsored by the Respect Life Office of the Archdiocese of New York.

The Sisters explained that the brunch borrows its name from God-given attributes endowed to women like receptivity, sensitivity, generosity and maternity that make up the feminine genius.

Their Website points out that in 1995, Pope John Paul II wrote a Letter to Women, which emphasized the important role women play in society and the Church. The Pope spoke of the distinct attributes of women—receptivity, sensitivity, generosity, and maternity—all of which make up the feminine genius.

The cost to attend the brunch is $30.

RSVP by February 18 at https://adnyfemininegeniusbrunch.eventbrite.com.
