With Amway doing a global rebrand to celebrate its 60th anniversary, Amway China has announced its new Chinese brand tagline – “Good things happening with Amway.”

According to the brand, it was inspired by the fact that young people in China use “Amway” as a word to describe an act in which a person shares something nice with another to inspire them and make something good happen.

DDB Beijing was tasked with localizing the Amway global rebranding strategy and brand image. Airing on Amway’s WeChat channel in China, the brand video tells five life stories – each one initiated by an “Amway” act.
