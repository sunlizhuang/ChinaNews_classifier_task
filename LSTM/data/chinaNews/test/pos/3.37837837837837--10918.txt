The Chinese Association of Barbados is eagerly anticipating the approaching Fish and Dragon Festival, since it will provide a unique opportunity to showcase Chinese food, culture and even a bit of history to the Barbadian population.

Philomena Lee, Secretary Treasurer with the Chinese Association of Barbados, noted the above recently even as she invited Barbadians to come out in their numbers and support the Fish and Dragon Festival, which is set to take place on Saturday January 18, 2020 at

5 p.m. at the Garfield Sobers Gymnasium.

“I am pleased that The Embassy of The People’s Republic of China in Barbados and the Central Bank have chosen to support and continue this Festival. It really provides that unique opportunity to show not only food, but the culture and sometimes the history as well between the countries,” Lee said.

“We from the Chinese Association of Barbados are happy to be able to participate, because we see it as providing some key experiences to Barbadians residents as well as visitors and the opportunity is here not only for Barbadian residents, but for some of our short-term visitors as well to see Barbadian as well as Chinese acts. This year, the headline act is from Northern China,” she revealed.

Lee stressed that this year, Barbadians can expect a wider range in terms of the Chinese cuisine that will be on offer at the Fish and Dragon Festival.

“Most Barbadians are accustomed to Cantonese food. Only a few restaurants offer food from other parts of China. However, in China, there are several different forms of cuisine. So this year, in addition to the normal Cantonese food which most Barbadians are accustomed to, we are trying to expose you so some of the food that is prevalent in Northern China.

“In Northern China, unlike the South, they use a lot more flour and so their food is based on things like dumplings. So we are going to try this year to bring more of this, so that the Barbadians people can experience authentic cuisine from China, as compared to just what you have been accustomed to. Because, just as the Festival has grown, I think it is very important for everyone to have an opportunity to expand the variety of cuisine available,” Lee added.

“So from our perspective, we are again very happy to participate in this Festival. I would like to encourage our Barbadian people, local residents, to come out. There is something there for everyone, whether you are an adult or a child,” Lee stated, as she invited Barbadians to give their support to the Festival.
