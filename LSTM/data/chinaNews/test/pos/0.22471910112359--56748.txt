Stanley Johnson has accidentally revealed that the Chinese ambassador was "concerned" Boris Johnson did not send a personal message after the outbreak of the coronavirus.

The Prime Minister's father copied in the BBC on an email where he relayed concern from Chinese officials who said they were yet to hear from the Prime Minister after the outbreak.

So far more than 28,300 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed and 565 people have died.

After Stanley Johnson met Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese Ambassador, on Tuesday, he sent an email to Lord Goldsmith and others in which he said: "Re the outbreak of coronavirus, Mr Liu obviously was concerned that there had not yet - so he asserted - been direct contact between the PM and Chinese head of state or government in terms of a personal message or telephone call."

Stanley told The Telegraph that the BBC had "got hold of an email by accident because the name of the person in the BBC who got it happened to be the same name as the person I was addressing in the department for the Environment".

"I'm obviously sorry it got sent to the wrong person by my computer. So the moral of that story..."

"I was absolutely delighted to get the chance to talk to the Chinese ambassador. We spoke mainly about all the preparations for the climate change conference on the one hand, and the big conference for biodiversity on the other."
