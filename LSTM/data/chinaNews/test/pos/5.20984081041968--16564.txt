Chinese New Year 2020 is almost upon us.

And the Chinese community in Birmingham will be celebrating, along with others across the UK and around the world.

The 2011 census indicated there were almost 13,000 people in Birmingham identifying as Chinese.

Another 31,000 identify as other Asian ethnicity apart from Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi - which would include Vietnamese, Korean and others that also celebrate a lunar-based new year at the same time.

So what will be happening in Birmingham this year?

Chinese New Year 2020 falls on January 25 and here is a full calendar of what's going on in and around the city this year.
