Throughout 2019, the struggle between multilateralism and unilateralism intensified around the world, led by a surge in protectionism, populism, power politics and bullying. Against this backdrop, contention among major powers was sharper, global governance faced many challenges and the world economy continued to be sluggish.

China saw its ties with the world from a wider perspective and rose to meet diplomatic challenges, displaying its strategic composure and confidence.

It strived to maintain stable relations with major powers in 2019. The year marked the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Russia. Their relationship is entering a new era of mutual support, deep convergence, continuous innovation and mutual benefit.

China-EU ties remained stable. Despite difficulties within Europe, China and EU leaders met frequently and reached broad consensus on major issues such as strengthening global governance, and upholding multilateralism and free trade.

The year also marked the 40th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and the U.S., which encountered severe challenges. Besides the prolonged trade war against China, the U.S. set other restrictions to contain China in technology and personnel exchanges. Moreover, it deliberately attacked China on its core interest issues concerning Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang, involving China's territorial sovereignty and national dignity.

China responded calmly and tried to contend with, but not confront, the U.S. It actively promoted phased agreements in order to achieve an early resolution to the trade friction.

In terms of neighborly diplomacy, overall stability was improved and China's influence grew in 2019. In Northeast Asia, relations between China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea and Japan continued to advance. In Southeast Asia, friction in the South China Sea eased, while leaders of South Asian countries met more frequently and guaranteed steady ties for further collaboration. The pragmatic cooperation between China and Central Asian countries continued to grow. Leaders from 15 participating countries concluded talks on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement.

China expanded and deepened its cooperation with other developing countries. The cooperation with Africa, Latin America and the Middle East remained stable.

China also participated more actively in the reform of global governance, shouldering the responsibility of a major country and becoming a defender and builder of the international system.

In 2020, China's diplomacy will continue to forge ahead to realize the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation and the world dream of building a community with a shared future for humanity.
