Karan Johar is what we call, the ultimate A-Lister of Bollywood. Apart from being best friends with all of your favourite celebs, KJo is always on top of his social media game and loves keeping up with the latest fashion trends.

From sneakers to jackets to sunglasses, if KJo is wearing them, you know they’re cool and cost a bomb. And unsurprisingly, the filmmaker’s preferences for hanging out and being spotted at are also real fancy. One of these places, which also happens to be the 47-year-old’s favourite restaurant in India is San-Qi.

The filmmaker revealed this to us exclusively at the 2019 Young Indians awards that were held in November 2019. His favourite, San-Qi is a fine-dine is located in Mumbai’s Four Seasons Hotel in Worli. It serves a Pan-Asian cuisine, with food coming from parts of North Indian, Japan, China and Thailand. It is especially well-known for its seafood, sushi and wasabi rolls. However, the restaurant’s signature dishes are the Mi-Cuit Sous Vide Octopus, the Dongpo-style Braised Pork Belly, the Ika-Okura Nori, the Sashimi Moriawase and the Kaisen Don. San-Qi also serves desserts that your sweet truth will fall in love with and so, do not miss out on those. Moreover, this “stylish modern” restaurant offers a long list of Indian and international wines that will perfectly pair with your meal.

Since it is a fine-dine restaurant, you may find it difficult to get a table without a prior reservation. The restaurant runs its lunch hours from 12 noon to 2.45pm. However, as far as dinner is concerned, you can grab a meal at San-Qi on weekdays from 7pm to 10.45pm. However, on Friday and Saturday the fine dine remains open till 11.45pm. In fact, this is the perfect time to visit this restaurant, as it is currently amidst Chinese New Year celebrations. For a limited time, you will have a chance to experience some of Chef Lin Lin Yang’s specials, paired with some fantastic cocktails. Considering all of this, it really does make sense that Karan Johar would love this restaurant. Not only is it trendy and serves some great food, it is also the perfect place to dine at with friends, family and colleagues. So be it a meal with his kids Roohi and Yash, or a meal with his long list of protégés, San-Qi is his preferred spot in the city. So if you do happen to run into the man behind Dharma Productions, make sure you’ve practiced the perfect pout.

On the work front, most recently Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions’ logo took a dark turn, to mark the company’s debut venture into the horror genre, with a film titled Bhoot Part One: The Haunted Ship. Besides that, the production giant also has films like Takht, a film with Vijay Deverakonda, Shershaah and Mr Lele in the pipeline as well. Karan Johar, himself, will next be seen in a new Netflix original reality show called What the Love!, which releases on January 30. With all this lined up for his future, it seems like Mr Johar is already winning 2020 as he was recently conferred with the Padma Shri award for his contribution to the Hindi Film Industry.
