China – Leading indicators rising

China will release GDP growth data for 4Q19 next week. In line with the long-term trend, China's GDP growth in 3Q dropped to +6.0% (previously +6.2%). However, the growth slowed somewhat more than before during the first three quarters of 2019, under the negative impact of the trade conflict. Against this backdrop, China's government has taken considerable fiscal and monetary policy support measures.

Based on our model, we expect a further weakening of GDP growth momentum to +5.8% in 4Q19. However, the outlook for 2020 has improved, due to the signing of a Phase 1 agreement with the US expected next week, as well as the government stimulus measures taken in 2019. Lending has already responded to this with a sharp increase in momentum in 4Q19. Sentiment in the manufacturing sector has also found a bottom. The sustained strength of the renminbi against the US dollar since September 2019 shows that financial market confidence in China's growth prospects has also increased. Against this background, we expect China's growth momentum to accelerate slightly from 1Q20 onwards. An acceleration of China's growth should also have a positive impact on the growth of other emerging economies. In our opinion, this should also benefit the Eurozone's foreign trade.

Germany – economic bottom reached in 2019?

Germany will release a first estimate of GDP growth for the full year 2019 next week (January 15).

Triggered by the global trade conflict and structural problems in the automobile sector, we expect Germany's GDP growth to have fallen to +0.5% in 2019 (2018: +1.5%). However, as there are signs of an economic upswing on the global level, we forecast that GDP growth in Germany will accelerate to +1.0% in 2020.

US labor market remains strong, with no signs of overheating

Overall, the figures in the December labor market report remained somewhat below market expectations. The number of newly created nonfarm payrolls amounted to 145,000, while the market had expected 160,000. In addition, the figures for the two previous months were revised downwards by a total of 14,000. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at the lowest level of 3.5%. Wage growth was weaker than expected. Average hourly wages rose by only 0.1% m/m, compared to the 0.3% forecast by the market. Although growth in the previous month was revised slightly upwards, the annual growth rate of 2.9% still remained well below market expectations of 3.1%.

Overall, the labor market remains strong without showing any signs of overheating. Although the new jobs created did not meet expectations, on average over the last two months employment rose by 200,000, which is significantly higher than the growth in the labor force. This means that the labor market is still becoming tighter. However, this is still not leading to any acceleration in wage growth. So there is no reason for the US Fed to intervene. As a result, the current figures should be digested quickly by capital markets.
