New Baojun rolled out four new models, the RS-5, RC-6, RM-5 and the RS-3, in the six months after its birth on the eve of the 2019 Shanghai Auto Show. The new brand aims to lead a new mobile lifestyle with new genes of youth, technology, connectivity and intelligence. It plans to launch 6 all-new models this year, including the E300, the RS-7, the RM-C, the RC-5 and a new energy model.

The automaker still expects Baojun brand to be its biggest sales contributor whose competitiveness lies in cost effectiveness and spacious room. To differ New Baojun from Baojun, their channels will be separated. Baojun will introduce facelift versions of its all-series models with major changes in exterior and interior in July and August 2020, while the redesigned or new-generation models will hit the market in 2021. In addition, Baojun also commits itself to exploring overseas market share and the Baojun 530 is SAIC-GM-Wulingâ€™s strategic model abroad.
