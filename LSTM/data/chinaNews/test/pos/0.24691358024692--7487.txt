This all began back in 2016 when Jaguar Land Rover decided to sue the Jiangling Motor Corporation over copyright infringement. The Chinese automaker's Land Wind X7 looked nearly identical to the Range Rover Evoque. The differences between the two could really only be spotted up close. Chinese copycat automotive designs are nothing new but the Land Wind X7 simply took things too far and JLR could not stand there and do nothing.

Fast forward to last March and JLR managed to claim a victory under China's Unfair Competition Law. This resulted in the Beijing Chaoyang District People's Court ordering Jiangling to stop all acts of unfair competition, including the manufacture, display, and sale of the Land Wind X7. The case was finally settled once and for all, right? Not quite.



Jiangling Holdings Co Ltd. immediately filed an appeal. Only today does this saga appear to finally be over.
