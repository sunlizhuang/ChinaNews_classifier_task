WIGAN MP Lisa Nandy has joined Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer in making it onto the final ballot in the race to become the next Labour Party leader.

To progress to the final ballot, candidates need the backing of three unions and affiliate groups representing five per cent of the membership.

Ms Nandy had already received support from the GMB union and the National Union of Mineworkers, as reported by the BBC.

And today, Wednesday, Chinese for Labour gave her their backing.

Shadow Cabinet members Emily Thornberry and Rebecca Long-Bailey have not yet made it to the next stage.

Jess Phillips pulled out of the leadership contest yesterday, Tuesday, and has pledged to support Ms Nandy, who was first elected in 2010.

The new Labour leader will be announced on April 4.
