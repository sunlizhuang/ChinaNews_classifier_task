TEMPO.CO, Batam - The issue of China's territorial claims of Natuna Waters has been heated, prompting President Joko Widodo to directly inspect the region.

Natuna is rich with natural beauty such as mines, flora, and fauna, among others. The region also boasts amazing tourist destinations.

Here are the 10 tourist destinations in one of Indonesia’s outermost regions.

1. Senua Island

Senua Island is located near Sepempang Village, Bunguran Timur District. The island is situated in the South China Sea, which has now become a polemic due to its proximity to Eastern Malaysia. A section of Senua Island is a dedicated natural conservation, while other sections of the island have gorgeous underwater scenery and a cave bird’s nest.

2. Alif Stone Park Natuna

Alif Stone Park has a stunning seaside view. Located not too far away from Ranai, this tourist destination has huge stone boulders positioned along a clearwater beach.

3. Datuk Natuna Bay

Datuk Natuna Bay has a rocky vista, punctuated with white pristine sands. The location is one hour away from Ranai, Natuna.

4. Sindu Stone Park Natuna
