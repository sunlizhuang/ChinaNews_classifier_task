Editor’s Notes: Nike continues to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Air Max 90, as the latest release celebrates the silhouette’s connection to five cities in particular: New York City, Paris, London, Tokyo, and Shanghai. The “City” pack ultimately pays tribute to the hardworking professionals who move their respective locations.

The New York City colorway from the “City” pack is a nod to the area’s firefighters. Inspired by the FDNY uniform, the Air Max 90 features a reflective Swoosh, custom heel emblem with screwed down hardware, and “90” branding, referencing old firefighter helmets.

The white Air Max 90 celebrates Parisian bakers, as the all-over white textile upper represents their uniform. The sneaker also incorporates a wheat graphic sockliner with a “Baked Fresh Daily” logo to further salute the profession.

Nike’s London iteration from the “City” pack highlights the city’s postmen and postwomen. This particular Air Max 90 features an upper inspired by a postal worker’s jacket, in addition to a round tongue emblem resembling a stamp with Nike’s co-founder Bill Bowerman.

The Tokyo edition Air Max 90 honors construction workers, with a special tongue pointing to street signs around construction sites and a sockliner printed with an image overlooking Japan’s cityscape.

Lastly, Shanghai’s delivery service workers are celebrated in the “City” pack as well. Inspired by the top two food delivery services in Shanghai, the sneaker arrives with a receipt tongue tab and a five-star mud guard underlay for a five-star review.
