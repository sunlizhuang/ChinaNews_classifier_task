42-year-old Kevin Qiu of Brooklyn, New York was detained at the Peace Bridge with an outstanding warrant for his arrest in Pennsylvania.

The man is currently being held at the Erie County Holding Center, according to WGRZ, and being examined for possibly carrying the Coronavirus due to his coming here from China.

The Center for Disease Control has a directive indicating that anyone traveling from China must be subject to 'enhanced health screenings'. However, Erie County will not take custody of the subject. The news report says that he will be released after they contact the health departments in Brooklyn, where he lives, and when all paperwork is finished.
