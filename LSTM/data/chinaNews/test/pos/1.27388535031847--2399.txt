(ECNS) -- Construction has begun on China's first 10,000-ton maritime patrol vessel, which will become the country's largest and best-equipped ship of its kind, the Guangdong Maritime Safety Administration said at a press conference on Tuesday.

The vessel is 165 meters long, 20.6 meters wide and 9.5 meters deep, with a designed displacement of 10,700 tons.

The patrol vessel will be able to carry multiple types of helicopters and have emergency search and rescue capabilities.

It will become China's integrated command flagship for far-reaching maritime cruise and rescue, and improve overall security for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

China has five patrol ships in service in Shanghai city, Shandong, Hainan, Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces, and one 5,000-ton patrol boat under construction.
