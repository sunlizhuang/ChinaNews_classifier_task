— President Donald Trump arrives in Davos this week ready to tout trade victories and potentially set a path for what could be a big trade fight with the European Union this year.

— The Trump administration closed out work on the Obama-era export control reform initiative by publishing a final rule on export regulations for firearms and ammunition.

— The U.S. and France agree to work toward a solution on the digital services tax issue by the end of the year, likely holding off on a tariff fight until then.

Driving the Day

TRUMP’S VICTORY MOMENT AT DAVOS: Trump arrives in Davos, Switzerland, this week with a China deal and a NAFTA update — fruits of his iconoclastic approach to globalism that he could show off to the world.

Meetings with other global leaders at the annual World Economic Forum could set the trajectory for what could be some of Trump’s 2020 trade policy targets. The president is expected to sit down today with new European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Joining Trump at Davos is a delegation of Cabinet members, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, that will include U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.

“This trip will provide an opportunity to highlight the American model of growth and prosperity on the global stage,” Mnuchin said in a statement. The top Treasury official will continue on with stops in the United Kingdom and Poland.

Trump, who skipped the event last year, is also set to hold bilateral meetings with the leaders of Iraq, Pakistan, Switzerland and the Kurdistan regional government, according to the White House.

POLITICO in Davos: Check out our daily Davos Playbook here to follow all aspects of the annual Swiss slopeside confab.

SWISS TO HOST MINI-MINISTERIAL FRIDAY: Lighthizer is expected to attend the annual mini-ministerial hosted by the Swiss government this Friday on the sidelines of the Davos meeting. That would give the U.S. trade chief a chance to discuss preparations for the WTO’s 12th ministerial conference in Kazakhstan in June, as well as brief key WTO members on any proposal he might have for salvaging the WTO Appellate Body.

The European Union shares “the analysis of the United States in relation to the need to reform the WTO, including the Appellate Body,” EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said last week at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “But we haven’t heard any proposals from the United States about how they want to do so and how they want to address their concerns, but they’re the ones that actually collapsed the Appellate Body.”

Hogan also said he would be engaging in “a sales and marketing approach” this week in Davos to get more countries to back the U.S.-EU-Japan joint statement on the need to strengthen WTO rules on industrial subsidies and forced technology transfers.

Will there be a Swiss-U.S. meeting? Beyond Trump’s meeting with Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga, it’s still unclear if Lighthizer will meet with Swiss officials for more “exploratory talks” on negotiating a free trade deal with the United States.

“Such an agreement would promote additional Swiss investment, job creation and workforce development in the United States,” Swiss Ambassador to the United States Jacques Pitteloud said in a recently-released report on Switzerland's Economic Footprint in the United States.

EXPORT CONTROL REFORM CHAPTER CLOSES: The administration will publish a final rule this week effectively completing an Obama-era export control reform initiative that sought to alter controls on a massive range of goods and technology that have both civilian and military uses. The rule finalizes the transfer of export regulation of firearms and ammunition from the stringent controls of the State Department to the more flexible regulations of the Commerce Department.

The Obama administration had held off on finalizing changes to export regulations on firearms because of ongoing mass shootings. The Trump administration reintroduced the proposal, but the issue was held up over Trump’s concerns regarding 3-D printed firearms. The final rule presents a “tailored approach” on regulating the publication of plans for 3-D printed firearms. Commerce will also maintain regulatory control over the export of technology and software that can be used to produce 3-D printed guns.

TRUMP TO SIGN USMCA AFTER DAVOS: Trump said Sunday he will sign USMCA into law when he returns from Davos, making it likely that a signing won’t occur until next week. Trump and the U.S. delegation will be in Davos until Jan. 24.

“When I come back, we’ll have a ceremony, probably in the White House. We also may go to some of the farming communities and we’re going to sign the deal,” Trump said Sunday at the American Farm Bureau Federation’s annual convention.

Slow-go: The USMCA won’t enter into force until 90 days after all three countries ratify it. That means the clock won’t start until Canada enacts the deal. Canada’s House of Commons must vote to fully enact the USMCA since the pact requires changes to legislation.

FRANCE THROWS DOWN ITS DIGITAL PROPOSALS: It could be a big week for the digital services tax, with Mnuchin set to meet his French counterpart, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The pair has frequently been in touch leading up to the meeting, which Paris hopes will set the two countries on a path toward a compromise without the U.S. following through on its threat to impose tariffs on $2.4 billion in French goods.

Le Maire told reporters on Friday that he had spoken at length with White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow and presented “a number of” new proposals for ways to resolve the issue. “We are progressing and hoping to come close to an agreement," he said. Reuters reported on Monday that the U.S. and France agreed to a truce on the issue until the end of this year.

Presidential phone call: Trump spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, and “the two leaders agreed it is important to complete successful negotiations on the digital services tax,” according to a White House readout.

Next steps: The Mnuchin-Le Maire meeting is not expected to entirely resolve the issue, but France’s hope is to hammer out a framework for how to move forward without additional penalties. EU countries — as well as many internet companies — are pushing for the U.S. to lay off its tariff threat and instead recommit to finding an international taxation system negotiated through the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.

“If the Americans decide to impose trade sanctions against digital taxation,” Le Maire said, “Europe will fight back.”

HOGAN FLOATS WAY TO TACKLE SOME AG IN TRADE DEAL WITH THE U.S.: Hogan on Monday said the EU and U.S. could find a compromise toward a free trade agreement by meeting halfway on agriculture.

Europe could offer dropping certain regulatory barriers to U.S. farm goods as part of a broader industrial trade deal if the U.S. accepted that the EU would not lower its farm tariffs. “So we are trying to look at ways where through regulatory cooperation we might be able to look at non-tariff barriers as a way of bringing agriculture issues on the table,” Hogan said at a BusinessEurope event in Brussels.

The U.S. has opposed formally opening negotiations on a trade agreement, arguing the EU must first agree to include a chapter liberalizing trade in agriculture. The Commission has pointed out that it has no mandate to negotiate lowering tariffs on agriculture, as France, Poland, Ireland and other EU countries oppose lowering EU tariffs for U.S. farm goods.

“We will not be able to agree [on] a mandate in the European Union to allow agriculture, but neither will they [the U.S.] be able to agree to include public procurement, or maritime issues or the buy American agenda,” Hogan said.

“We have a long list on both sides” of regulatory barriers in agriculture, Hogan said, which could be “resolved” as part of a trade agreement.

AUTO 232 REPORT STILL MIA: The Commerce Department appears to have ignored a provision in a massive spending bill signed by Trump on Dec. 20 requiring the department to publish in the Federal Register within 30 days the results of its 2018 Section 232 investigation that found auto imports pose a risk to national security.

It also requires the department to make any classified section of the report available to members of Congress and their staff with the appropriate security clearance.

Three other missing reports: USTR still has not released the annual reports on China’s and Russia’s compliance with World Trade Organization rules, which usually come out in December. It also has not released its annual intellectual property rights “notorious markets” report, which could potentially include U.S. internet giant Amazon for the first time.

ZTE HIRES AKIN GUMP: ZTE, the Chinese telecommunications firm that has spent heavily lobbying the Trump administration in an effort to ensure it can do business with American companies, has added Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld to its lineup of outside lobbying firms, our POLITICO Influence colleagues report.

Hal Shapiro, an Akin Gump partner and a former White House aide in the Clinton administration, said ZTE hired the firm to advise it on complying with U.S. export controls and sanctions as part of agreements ZTE struck with the administration.

Former BRT VP now at Sandler: In other hiring news, David Thomas, former vice president for trade policy at the Business Roundtable, has joined Sandler, Travis & Rosenberg, where he will advise and represent clients on international trade issues before Congress and the executive branch as well as assist on issues related to customs rules, policies, and procedures.
