NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio is in a better position to launch commercial services based on fifth-generation or 5G technology, following its network readiness, a top executive of the Chinese smartphone maker said."Currently, Jio is best poised as their network is 5G ready," Arijeet Talapatra , chief executive of Transsion India told ETT, and added that affordability would remain an important factor.Talapatra said that 5G would be a huge investment for industry players with the technology being at a nascent stage and such a move would be dependent upon their investors interest and brand strategy.For a less than Rs 15,000 5G smartphone, industry, according to the executive, would only invest once they see the network, and such a momentum, he said is expected to start in 2021.Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Jio that forayed into pure-play fourth-generation or 4G services in September 2016, is the only profit-making telco that intends to switch to a 5G network after bidding for airwaves in the upcoming sale.Reliance Retail, a subsidiary of oil-to-logistics conglomerate Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) had parallely launched cost-friendly 4G feature phones, under the LYF brand in January 2016 to complement Jio's telecom network.Mumbai-based telecom carrier, according to a report, was however already working on 5G-capable devices with plans afoot to launch new smartphones in tandem with the commercial roll out of 5G services after allocation of spectrum post auction.India's business behemoth has unveiled the first affordable LTE-compatible feature phone JioPhone based on KaiOS platform in August 2017.The executive said that 2G users moved to 4G because 2G users did not move to 3G, and while in a scenario where operators were anyways closing down 3G, it would be 4G which would shift to 5G."It is also seen that some 2G users would move to 5G directly, and then affordability factor rises. If a consumer want a transition from 2G to 5G, devices must be aggressively priced," Talapatra said.India has presently nearly 400 million subscribers who use 2G networks while unlike rivals Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, Jio has called upon the government and sector regulator to take policy steps to make country 2G free.Transsion Holdings is working closely in the Chinese ecosystem, he said, and added that some brands in India might bring 5G-compatible models in H2 2020 with most of them likely to be priced above Rs 20,000.With Africa being Transsion's biggest market, the company has a multi-brand strategy with itel, Tecno, Infinix and Oraimo brands, and one of its flagship brands itel alone has achieved a milestone of 50 million customers in a period of three years.
