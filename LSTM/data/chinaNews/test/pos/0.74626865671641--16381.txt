The Hong Kong International Boat Show (HKIBS), which is traditionally held in December, was cancelled last year because of protests experienced in the territory.

In response to this, Club Marina Cove, which organises HKIBS, has put forward a proposal to possibly hold the show in April or if not in December. The two proposed timings are April 23-26, 2020 or December 3-6, 2020.

Club Marina Cove has invited interested parties to indicate which dates they prefer but the organiser has said they would like to go with the April dates. Any company interested in presenting their view should contact Thomas Woo at thomas@marineitalia.asia or Tel: +852 2325 3355, Mobile: +852 9383 3333.

Winnie Ng, general manager of Club Marina Cove, commented that “for those participants who have their deposits with us, we are pleased to offer them priority in the booking of spaces in both the in-water display or hardstand display areas.”

The main challenge for the April timing is simply the shortage of time to bring all the show elements together. There was an event organised by the Hong Kong Cruise & Yacht Association last November but this was limited in its scope.

Hong Kong traditionally had two boat shows – the Hong Kong Gold Coast Boat Show in May and the HKIBS in the first week of December at Club Marina Cove. The former has not been held over recent years and there seems little prospect of returning.

Because of the show situation both in Hong Kong and China, local yacht and boat dealers have tended to focus of dedicated events covering one or more brands over the past few years.
