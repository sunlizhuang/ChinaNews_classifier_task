EAST BRUNSWICK, NJ - Happy Year of the Rat! The Mid-Jersey Chinese School, which has held classes in language and culture for many years at Churchill Junior High School here in East Brunswick for many years, celebrated in style yesterday with a program featuring encomiums, performances, and traditional style.

"The Rat is the first of all zodiac animals. According to one myth, the Jade Emperor said the order would be decided by the order in which they arrived to his party. The Rat tricked the Ox into giving him a ride. Then, just as they arrived at the finish line, Rat jumped down and landed ahead of Ox, becoming first.

The Rat is also associated with the Earthly Branch (地支—dì zhī) Zi (子) and the midnight hours. In the terms of yin and yang (阴阳—yīn yáng), the Rat is yang and represents the beginning of a new day.
