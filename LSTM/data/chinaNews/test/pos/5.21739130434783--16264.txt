MADISON, WI (Wisconsin Radio Network) -- The folks who make cheese in Wisconsin are happy to see a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico. The Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association, the American Dairy Coalition, and the Wisconsin Farm Bureau on Friday all said the new agreement will open up new markets to Wisconsin cheese and milk.

The U.S. Senate approved the USMCA last week. Itâ€™s now waiting for President Trump to sign it into law.

A recently signed phase one trade deal with China will also be a boon to farmers. China will buy an additional $200 billion in U.S. exports over the next two years.
