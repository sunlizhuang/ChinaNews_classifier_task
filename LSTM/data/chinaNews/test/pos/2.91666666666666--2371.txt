A CHARITY is calling on volunteers to help with making hygiene kits to be taken to girls in Uganda.

Days for Girls, in Fordingbridge, will be running the second workshop to make high-quality kits which are set to be delivered to their link Diocese of Kinkiizi in South Western Uganda, where the girls often miss out on their education due to their period.

Each kit will include washable sanitary pads, knickers, flannels and soap.

Once reaching puberty or starting their menstrual cycle, Days for Girls say girls throughout the developing world are in danger of losing up to 25 percent of their education.

The international charity is working to empower women through health education and income generation opportunities.

Irene Canton, Days for Girls Fordingbridge team leader, said: “The team would like to thank everyone for their generosity and skill in supporting the Days for Girls project so far. Our aim this time is to complete kits to send out in May this year with the next group visit.

"With your help we should be able to compile 100 bags. This means we will have made over 1,000 items, including bags, shields and liners.

“This day will be fun and sociable but we aim to make as many kits as we can to make a real difference to the girls in Kinkiizi.”

Experienced sewers, as well as volunteers to put the kits together, iron items, roll knickers, and add ribbons and poppers, are all needed at the workshop.

Tea, coffee and a sandwich lunch will be provided at the workshop, which is taking place on Saturday January 18.

The event runs from 10am to 4pm in St Mary’s Church Hall, Fordingbridge.
