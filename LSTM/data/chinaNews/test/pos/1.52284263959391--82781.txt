The China Women's Development Foundation (CWDF) recently initiated a project aiming at providing care and support to families of frontline medical workers fighting against the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak.

The project has allocated funds to the women's federations nationwide, for delivering "loving packages" consisting of protective supplies and daily necessities worth 500-1,000 yuan (US $71.19-142.38) to frontline medical workers fighting against the COVID-19 and their families.

The first phase of the project has covered 5,000 medical workers and their families in eight provinces, including Hubei, Henan, Hunan, and Anhui. It will be expanded to more medical workers' families in other provinces and cities as the CWDF collects more funds.

Many enterprises and organizations responded to the CWDF's call for fund-raising. As of February 18, the project had raised about 4.13 million yuan (US $587,474.72).

Based on the needs of frontline medical workers and their families, the local women's federations selected various items, including specialties, nuts, vegetables, fruits, protective products and daily necessities.

In Central China's Hunan Province, the Hunan Women's Federation identified the contact information and addresses of 1,250 frontline medical workers fighting against the COVID-19 in hospitals as well as medical workers assisting Hubei. The "loving packages" will be delivered to their home soon.

In East China's Jiangxi Province, the project fully covers the families of medical staff who are helping COVID-19 control efforts in Hubei.

In Southwest China's Chongqing Municipality, the Chongqing Women's Federation sent "loving packages" worth 800 yuan (US $113.90) to families of more than 1,900 medical staff working on the frontline in Hubei and in four local hospitals, to help ease their worries.
