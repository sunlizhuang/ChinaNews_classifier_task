What is Chinese New Year?

Vickie Lee, author of the children’s book “Ruby’s Chinese New Year,” told USA Today that Chinese New Year is “the most important and the most popular holiday for Chinese people and in the Chinese culture.”

"It’s a very joyful holiday (when) you’re supposed to go home, see your family," she added of the time spanning about 15 days. "In China, they celebrate it for two full weeks, and people actually travel home and from far, far away.“

Each Chinese New Year centers around a particular zodiac sign which holds importance to Chinese culture.
