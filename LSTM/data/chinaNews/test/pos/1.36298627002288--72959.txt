Australia to offer Pacific funds to PNG for ambitious plan to get power to the people

Posted

Papua New Guinea's ambitious plan to bring electricity to millions of people is set to be the first project supported by Australia's new infrastructure aid bank.

Key points: The Federal Government has a $2 billion "Pacific Step-Up" bank for infrastructure projects

Australia may invest $250 million in PNG's energy sector

PNG has an $11.8 billion national debt, more than one-third of its GDP

As part of its "Pacific Step-Up," the federal government established a $2 billion bank to offer loans for infrastructure projects in the region.

It has yet to provide any loans despite being launched in 2018, but the ABC has learnt PNG's electrification program will soon get financial backing from the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP).

Here's what you need to know.

What's PNG's plan?

PNG wants to get electricity to 70 per cent of its population by the end of the decade.

It is an ambitious aim, given only 13 per cent of the country's 8.25 million citizens currently have an electricity connection.

Most families have no access to the electricity network and many others are unable to afford power where connections are available.

The remote nature of PNG's rural communities and the country's mountainous terrain add to the difficulties of getting electricity to most people.

Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Japan all committed in 2018 to helping PNG, announcing an "Electrification Partnership".

But there has been little detail on how much money would be offered, or what projects would be supported, by the four countries.

What help is Australia offering?

The government is expected to announce the details of its support when the Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Alex Hawke, visits Port Moresby later this month.

The AIFFP, which is run by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, has $1.5 billion available for loans and $500 million for grants for the Pacific and Timor-Leste.

DFAT officials provided some information in writing to the parliament after senators asked questions about it last year.

"The AIFFP is considering options to support PNG electrification," the department answered.

"Pending relevant approvals, projects may be funded through a mix of grants and loans from the AIFFP's $2 billion funding envelope."

It also suggested that money from the bilateral aid program to PNG may also be used to help the electrification plans, whilst in the past Prime Minister Scott Morrison has mentioned working with the private sector.

PNG will need new electricity generation, as well as a vastly expanded network for transmission and connections.

Australia's support could target a discrete project, such as the development of new dams for hydro-electric power.

Last year, Mr Morrison indicated Australia would invest in PNG's energy sector to the tune of $250 million, but it is not clear whether the imminent announcement will be part of, or in addition to, that.

But didn't Australia just give PNG a big loan?

Australia gave PNG a short-term $440 million emergency loan last year.

That loan was to help pay for day-to-day government expenses until PNG Prime Minister James Marape could re-finance his country's debt.

Australia's emergency loan also displaced a proposed loan from the China Development Bank, a move in keeping with Canberra's desire to curb Beijing's influence in the Pacific.

PNG has a national debt burden of 27 billion kina ($11.8 billion), which represents more than one-third of the nation's GDP.

The AIFFP assistance for PNG's electrification will need to keep in mind the enormous debt PNG is already carrying if it is to offer support via loans, rather than grants.
