(ECNS) -- Wearing a mask, head gear and doctor's overalls, John Cary checked his patient's eyes and tongue while taking his pulse at the Hospital of TCM and Hui Nationality Medicine affiliated to Ningxia Medical University.

The over- 60-year old American provides medical services at the hospital twice a week since Feb. 10, and receives about 10 patients a day.

He and colleague Tang Lilong have offered online medical services after the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Cary is good at combining traditional Chinese medicine with western treatment, said Tang, associate professor at Ningxia Medical University.

His specific treatment has received much praise from patients.

"I thought only Chinese doctors are good at traditional Chinese medicine. I didn't expect this foreign doctor would also be good. It's really amazing," said a patient surnamed Xie.

Cary learned about traditional Chinese medicine in 1988 after suffering severe migraines. At the suggestion of a friend, he visited a Chinese doctor of Oriental Medicine in Atlanta. After a few sessions of acupuncture, his headaches were cured. He has studied traditional Chinese medicine ever since.

After many years of intense training under Chinese instructors, he moved to China. "I hope to promote traditional Chinese medicine to the world," he said.

Traditional Chinese medicine has been proven effective in curing patients of the novel coronavirus pneumonia, according to experts and health officials.

Commenting on measures taken by the local government to fight the novel coronavirus, Cary said, "This could have happened anywhere but it sadly enough hit Wuhan. I must admit I admire the way the Chinese government is handling this and how strong the people are."

"When it's over, China will prove to the world how strong she is," he added. "I hope America will learn how to handle a crisis like this from the Chinese."
