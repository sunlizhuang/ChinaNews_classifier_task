Re: Pipeline impact on environment

In Andy Thomsen’s letter (A Positive Step – Jan. 27), it is suggested that pipelines will not impact the environment.

As far as the LNG pipeline through the Wet’suwet’en territories, this pipeline should have a significant impact on the environment.

This will hopefully supply natural gas to Chinese markets and replace their need for coal. It's a much, much cleaner source of power and therefore reducing those greenhouse gases currently being put out by burning coal.

What is somewhat ironic is that the Wet’suwet’en chiefs are so opposed to this clean power supply when they and their supporters tell us how much they want to protect our environment.

It seems to me supplying a clean burning alternative to coal is way better for the environment.

The fact it will be good for Canada’s (and therefore the Wet’suwet’en) economy is a real bonus.
