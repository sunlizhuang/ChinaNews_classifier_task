Bangkok: USS America, equipped with the super-advanced F-35B stealth fighter jets and USS Green Bay, reached Thailand on Saturday. Both the countries announced that these warships would be participating in the 11 day long naval exercises with the Thai navy. Meanwhile, it is reported that China has been building a secret military base in Cambodia, the neighbour of Thailand. Against this background, the exercises of the amphibious aircraft carrier USS America equipped with F-35B fighter jets, in Thailand, are considered important.

The US and Thai navy hold ten days long, Cobra Gold war exercises every year. Like every year, this year too, the United States has sent its marines’ unit for these exercises. This year the exercise will be conducted for 11 days from 25th February to 6th March. The United States has sent its super-advanced amphibious aircraft carrier USS America for this exercise.

Till now, AV-8B Harrier 2 fighter jets were deployed on this warship, which is a part of the Indo-Pacific Command. But since the last few months, the United States has started deployment of super-advanced F-35B stealth fighter jets on the amphibious aircraft carriers. Only a few weeks ago, deployment of 13 F-35B fighter jets was completed on the USS America. After that, the warship reached Thailand passing through the South China Sea.

The US and Thai naval officials held discussions regarding the exercise on Saturday. The warship will be in the Laem Chabang port of Thailand, for the next two weeks. US military analysts have been claiming that the deployment of USS America in Thailand, is a warning for China. It was recently exposed that China had been building a secret military base at Koh Kong area in neighbouring Cambodia.

The confidential documents between the People’s Liberation Army of China and the Cambodian military were exposed to the world. As per these documents, Cambodia has leased the Koh Kong region to China for 30 years. Therefore, China can deploy its soldiers, defence equipment and weapon systems in this area. Reports had also been published that China had increased the depth of the port to be able to dock its destroyers.

In this scenario, it is claimed that the presence of USS America equipped with F-35B stealth fighter jets in the region is a warning for China.
