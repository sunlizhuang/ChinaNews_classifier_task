Original report:

The man is in his 20s and lives in Boston, the release said. When the man recently returned to Massachusetts, he sought medical care and has been isolated since that time. He will remain isolated until he is cleared by public health officials.

“We are grateful that this young man is recovering and sought medical attention immediately,’’ Massachusetts Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel told WFXT. “Massachusetts has been preparing for a possible case of this new coronavirus, and we were fortunate that astute clinicians took appropriate action quickly.

"Again, the risk to the public from the 2019 novel coronavirus remains low in Massachusetts.”

“Our priority is not only to protect and inform the residents of Boston but also to help this man continue to recover. We are pleased that he is doing well,” BPHC Executive Director Rita Nieves said. “Right now, we are not asking Boston residents to do anything differently. The risk to the general public remains low. And we continue to be confident we are in a good position to respond to this developing situation.”

The Massachusetts Department of Health and the Boston Public Health Commission were notified late Friday night of the positive test results by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A few close contacts of the man have been identified and are being watched for any signs of symptoms.

This is the eighth case of the coronavirus infection reported in the United States.
