Who's ready for fresh Philly cheese steaks and Chinese food at La Palmera's food court?

The mall announced today that Charleys Philly Steaks and China Max soon will be opening at the mall's food court.

Known for its delicious sandwiches grilled fresh to order, particularly the Philly Cheesesteak, the new Charleys will also feature other favorites like gourmet loaded fries and real fruit lemonades. With nearly 600 locations in 46 states and 17 countries, this is the first Charleys Philly Steaks in the Coastal Bend.

And China Max provides diverse food offerings with a fusion of various Southeast Asian cooking styles to complement its fresh and healthy traditional Chinese fare. Guests will be treated to a wide variety of authentic soups, appetizers and entrées, featuring beef, chicken, pork, seafood and vegetable options, rice and lo mein dishes and more.

Both new restaurants will be opening later this spring.

Other new retailers coming to the mall include Lush, specializing in handmade beauty products; phone repair experts Digi I Fix; an expanded MTV Nails location and a remodeled Pretzelmaker.

Also announced for this year are the new Homes2 Suites by Hilton, which is currently under construction adjacent to La Palmera near Dillard’s and set to open this summer, and Razzoo’s Cajun Café, near JCPenney off Staples Street in the mall’s southeast parking area, scheduled to open this fall.
