MIDDLETOWN — Developers are betting on a hot downtown housing market by making hefty area housing investments, emphasizing structure and style to entice renters.

Dongfan Zhang, who moved from China to the U.S. in 2012 and owns a dry-cleaning business in Brooklyn, said through a translator that she purchased 59-61 North St., a two-story building with two commercial spaces on the first floor and five apartments on the second floor, as an investment that grew into a full-blown renovation.

After seeing pictures of the original three-floor building that was ravaged by a fire decades ago, destroying the top floor that allowed it to become a playground for graffiti artists, Zhang decided she wanted to bump up the roof and add the third floor back to its structure with five additional apartments. It's a project with an estimated $1.5 million price tag.

“I want to (help) make the city beautiful again,” Zhang said.

The city has about eight projects in the planning or building stages, according to city Mayor Joseph DeStefano and Economic Development Director Maria Bruni. There are more preliminary plans in talks as investors buy up more downtown property.

“It's a national thing,” DeStefano said. “Especially young people want to come downtown.”

Vannessa Cid, 22, has lived for about a year with her partner and a cousin in a two-bedroom, one-bathroom, third floor walk-up apartment of a North Street building owned by Sal Vasapolli.

“I love it,” Cid said. “Whenever there's an event, it's right around the corner.”

Vasapolli has owned three North Street buildings for four years, where he has a handful of store fronts and almost a dozen apartments rented out.

In the last year, Vasapolli purchased multiple properties, including 22-26 Montgomery St. and 11-13 Orchard St., situated along the soon-to-be Heritage Trail, hoping to renovate dilapidated buildings with his family construction and design company in a similar fashion to the $50,000 he put into the apartment Cid lives in now for $1,600 a month.

At the Montgomery Street property he purchased in spring 2019, Vasapolli has renderings for a “Downtown Village,” a proposed 17-apartment complex with gated parking, a restaurant, and stylish, upscale housing with outdoor spaces that is awaiting city planning board approvals. If it becomes what Vasapolli has envisioned, it will take about $4 million, total, to get there, he said.

Lofts in that proposed development would start at about $1,600 a month, a one-bedroom apartment would start at about $1,800 a month and a two-bedroom would start at about $2,400 a month.

“We want to be part of this new revitalization of Middletown,” Vasapolli said, noting that he's seen the city rise and fall over the years, but not like it is now.

“We are the market setters,” he added.

As businesses fill up the storefronts downtown, renters follow suit, Bruni said.

“They're feeding off each other,” Bruni said.

Lower-end housing is going for about $900 for a one-bedroom apartment, Bruni said, and two bedrooms are in the $1,500-1,800 range.

“We're not pushing people out,” DeStefano said of rising rents, denying gentrification and adding that the amount of low-income housing the city has “more than makes up for anything here.”

Zhang's construction manager, Sen Wang, who also owns 32-34 North St., said he expects the second floor apartments, four two-bedrooms and one one-bedroom, to be finished by the end of the summer.

They will be priced low, at about $1,400 a month, because of the expected influx in housing supply.

Time will tell whether or not the demand shows up.
