CANTON -- Deep Root Center is once again offering Exploration Station programming during the February School Break from Feb. 17-21.

This will be similar to DRC summer and afternoon programs with plenty of opportunities for creative expression, indoor and outdoor play, and exploration of personal interests, said a press release from the center.

There will be a drop-in rate, as well as a weekly rate.

The center is also extending its hours to 5:30, with an additional fee, if you need it. The center asks families who choose to drop-in to let us know which days they will be here the week prior to plan staffing.
