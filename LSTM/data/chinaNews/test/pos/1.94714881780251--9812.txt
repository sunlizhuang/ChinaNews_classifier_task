Countries such as China, India, and others are seeing a surge in the demand for two-wheelers owing to the growing demands for daily commuting. Therefore, the increase in the sales of two-wheelers in Asia will have a positive impact on the growth of the global two-wheeler ignition switch market.

Global Two-Wheeler Ignition Switch Market: Development of Keyless Ignition System

Several two-wheeler manufacturers have started offering keyless ignition systems as an option in some of their two-wheeler models. Keyless ignition systems improve convenience and safety in two-wheelers and enable locking and unlocking of the steering lock as well as the fuel filler cap. Currently, the penetration of keyless ignition systems in the two-wheeler market is low as only a few luxury two-wheeler models come equipped with this feature. With the growing demand for convenience, safety and security in two-wheelers, the adoption of keyless ignition systems will increase during the forecast period.

"Many premium motorcycle makers are shifting their manufacturing plants to Asian countries. In addition, the development of a biometric-based ignition system will further boost market growth during the forecast period," says a senior analyst at Technavio.
