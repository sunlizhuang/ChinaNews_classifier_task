Parents are urged to take their wards to the doctor if they noticed any symptoms of influenza

Schools and universities in the UAE have been asked to sanction two weeks leave to students or staffs members who have either recently travelled to China or if any of their family members have returned from the virus-hit region.

According to Emarat Al Youm, the circular ordered the leave to be sanctioned for 14 days from the date of arrival from the country even if they don't exhibit any coronavirus symptoms.

The department of Education and Knowledge in Abu Dhabi has sent messages to parents in which they explained that no cases were detected in the emirate. It urged parents to take their wards to the doctor if they noticed any symptoms of influenza or any other breathing problems.

The directives issued by the Ministry of Health and Prevention, Health Department in Abu Dhabi, Dubai Health Department and Abu Dhabi Public Health center have all said that the school environment must be safe.
