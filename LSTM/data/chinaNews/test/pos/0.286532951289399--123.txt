Savelife.org.cn, also known as Love and Hope, is the first domestic organ donor registration system. Its registered volunteers surpassed 1 million on July 2, 2019, and over 53 percent of them are from the post-90s generation.

Bai Yining, born in 1999, signed a body donation agreement last year, a decision that was supported by her parents. She and Liang Jiali, also a post-90s college student, became the second and third registered volunteers for body donation in northwest China's Gansu province. Bai was the youngest person to decide to donate her body in the province last year.

Yu Su, a senior student majoring in Clinical Medicine Science at the Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University, began to change her attitude toward death after her mother died from acute myocarditis, which was a major blow to her.

Yu became a hospice care volunteer and established a similar voluntary association at the college to help patients.

According to a white paper released by the China Will Registration Center in 2019, the Chinese mainland has seen more young testators. By October 2019, 246 post-90s people wrote wills. The youngest among them is only 18 years old.

Chen Jin, director of the center's promotion department, said that writing a will is an act of responsibility toward one's family, adding that it reflected the post-90s generation's rational attitude to death, and that those young testators at the center made the decision after considering the matter in a mature manner.

Members of the post-90s generation are also buying health care and insurance products to prevent risks. A report revealed that 21.9 percent of the group have used health care products for a long time, while nearly 50 percent occasionally took health supplements. According to another report, people from the post-90s group held four insurance policies on average.
