MyBioGate is organizing one of the industry’s leading events in San Francisco during the JPM Week.

Representatives with MyBioGate announced that they are organizing the largest China-themed partnering conference during JPM Week. The China Focus@San Francisco partners conference will be held on 12 January 2020 at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco from 8 am to 7 pm.

“China Focus would like to be your gateway to China’s healthcare and life science industry. For the overseas biopharmas interested in this huge market with enormous potential, partnering is the preferred approach,” said Miao Guo, Vice President of Operations and spokesperson for MyBioGate and added, “as the largest China-themed partnering conference during JPM Week, China Focus@San Francisco is a golden opportunity for 1-on-1 meetings to connect with Chinese decision-makers.”

“More than 300 business leaders and enthusiastic investors are ready to schedule personal meetings with you,” pointed out Guo.

Guo highlighted that China Focus @San Francisco is a partnering forum designed to provide a meaningful platform to inform, inspire, and foster cross-border partnerships in life science and healthcare.

“China embraced a vigorously growing healthcare market in the past decade. Ever since joining ICH in 2017, China has seen increased clinical trials and accelerated new drug and device approval, stressed Guo. “For life science and healthcare companies outside of China, you need to find the right partners and the right resources to bring your products to China to adapt to the difference in culture, regulation, reimbursement, etc. Chinese biotechs are also actively seeking global market entry opportunities and oversea partners.”

China's domestic pharmaceutical consumption has increased dramatically in the past several years. By 2020, China’s pharmaceutical market volume is expected to grow to USD 220 billion, becoming the second-largest market after the United States, as reported by Deloitte.

As for who should attend the event, Guo emphasized that the event is ideal for investors, life science innovators and entrepreneurs, biotech & big pharma companies, Medtech (device and diagnostics) manufacturers and distributors, service providers (law firm, financial advisory, regulatory consulting, CRO, CDMO, etc.), and healthcare providers.

Main topics to be covered during China Focus@San Francisco are cross-border investments, Innovations going to China: regulation, market access, manufacturing and distribution

Chinese innovations going west: partnership for capital and market access in the U.S.
