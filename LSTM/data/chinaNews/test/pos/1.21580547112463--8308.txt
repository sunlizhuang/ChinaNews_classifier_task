The company has reported a profit of Rs. 217 million in FY19, with a revenue of Rs. 2.57 billion during the year. It has also reported an earning per share of Rs. 3.04 according to the draft prospectus.

The company was incorporated in 2010 and commenced operations in 2011 with two initial products, fresh chilled beef and mutton, and frozen boneless beef, having capacities of 5 tons per day and 3 tons per day respectively

Since then the company has expanded its daily production capacity to 75 TPD and 30 TPD and product

portfolio to four (4) products with multiple market coverage. Currently, it has the largest product range as well as market access from Pakistan’s meat export sector.

TOMC’s slaughtering and meat processing facility is spread over 11 acres at Gadap, Karachi. The facilities are approved to supply products to Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, (KSA), United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Egypt, Azerbaijan, Malaysia, and Vietnam, whereas efforts are underway to procure approvals for new markets such as Hong Kong, China, and Russia. TOMC has also successfully qualified as a direct vendor to large regional food processors such as National Foods (Americana), Sunbula in KSA, etc.

Furthermore, owing to large demand of the company’s offal product, TOMC plans to set up an offal processing facility at Export Promotion Zone, Port Qasim Karachi where it will import raw offal from Ukraine, CIS region, Germany, Italy and another one at Korangi, Karachi where raw offal will be processed for exports to Vietnam, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Myanmar.

Furthermore, once the Chinese market opens up for Pakistani food products, the company plans to export directly to the lucrative Chinese market for meat and offal.

Potential in Halal Meat Sector

Halal meat is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world, contributing around 16% to the world food trade, but Pakistan’s share in this is not as much as it can be. Pakistan, being the fifth largest producer of livestock in the world, is still not among the top ten Halal product exporting countries. Livestock share stands at 11.11 percent of GDP, yet Pakistan’s global share in Halal meat exports is around 2.9% according to Halal Research Council (HRC).

Pakistan Halal Authority (PHA) is looking to capture international markets to export halal products.

The newly established authority has set targets to export products, especially meat, to get Pakistan’s due share in the rapidly growing global Halal market.

Pakistan has a 100% Halal production base and has direct access to consumers in Central Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. Therefore, Pakistan has a great opportunity to gain a big share in the global Halal market by enhancing production and improving quality.
