Elon Musk revealed he has moves by dancing and performing an awkward striptease before an audience at Tesla’s (TSLA) Shanghai Gigafactory.

The event was held to promote the accomplishments of the facility, including the first Model 3 cars delivered by the electric car maker.

At the event, Musk can be seen grooving as the crowd cheers on. Not one to shy from the spotlight, Musk pulled out a brief “Walk Like An Egyptian” gesture and threw his jacket off as he swung it above his head.

The performance was a first for Musk, who later tweeted the video from the event on Twitter, saying it was “NSFW.”

While marked by Musk’s stage entrance, the event was designed to promote all that Tesla has achieved in China. Musk has said that he will design an electric vehicle in China that will be sold worldwide, in addition to using the Shanghai’s Gigafactory to produce the Model Y SUV, CNBC reported.

Shares of Tesla stock were up 3.71% as of 1:37 p.m. EST on Tuesday.
