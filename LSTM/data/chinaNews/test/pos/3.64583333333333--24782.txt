Federal New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh helped ring in the Lunar New Year in Burnaby on Saturday.

Year of the Rat celebrations, which began Saturday, are taking place all weekend across Metro Vancouver, including the annual Spring Festival Parade in Vancouver on Sunday. That festival draws more than 100,000 spectators each year. This year’s animal on the Chinese zodiac, the rat, symbolizes fortune and fertility, and people born in the Year of Rat are thought to be optimistic and energetic.

Singh began his day at the Lunar New Year bell ringing ceremony at the Tian-Jin Temple, before heading to a festival at the Grand Villa Casino, and a tour at the Crystal Mall. He then planned to hit up the Lunar New Year festival at Metropolis at Metrotown.

The Lunar New Year, also sometimes called Chinese New Year, is celebrated in most Asian countries and in many different places around the world. Much of China this year, however, has put celebrations on hold as many cities are on lockdown, and events are cancelled because of the Wuhan coronavirus. As of Saturday, the virus had killed 26 people and sickened hundreds, according to Chinese authorities.

B.C. Premier John Horgan wished all British Columbians celebrating a prosperous Year of the Rat.

“May this year be one of good luck, good health and great prosperity,” he said, on Twitter.
