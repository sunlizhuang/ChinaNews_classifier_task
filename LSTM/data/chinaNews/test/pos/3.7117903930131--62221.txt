Joan Canton was the queen of SWAG Saturday.

Canton is one of the founders of the Southwest Advocacy Group, a cadre of women — some from wealthy neighborhoods and Canton from Linton Oaks — who achieved far beyond what others would have predicted in creating a set of buildings and services to help children and adults.

On Saturday, Canton was honored by a big crowd of well-wishers at a luncheon announcing that a new playground will be dedicated to her.

"To me, it’s very important to not just overlook or dismiss children," Canton said. "Now we can give people skills to help people help themselves. People were willing to help us help ourselves."

Canton and other SWAG founders, including Dorothy Benson, Alison Law and Dr. Nancy Hardt, developed a plan to help neighborhoods along Southwest 20th/24th Avenue where residents lived with disparities in education, health, income and opportunity.

They worked to get money from the Alachua County Commission and from organizations such as Rotary clubs to make their plan a reality.

It started with a family resource center in Linton Oaks that opened in 2012 in some renovated apartments.

It has computers and internet access, after-school tutoring programs, summer programs for kids, a food pantry, health and exercise programs, free notary services, counseling services and parenting support.

Next up was a health clinic, especially needed because a bus trip across town to the Alachua County Health Department in East Gainesville could take hours.

In a collaboration with the University of Florida and O2B Kids, the SWAG Child Center was created to ensure the health and early education of children up to age 5.

All of the buildings are in Linton Oaks and serve it and the adjoining neighborhoods.

Canton’s party was in the Child Center, which was packed with family, friends and people she helped over the years. Many of the people who spoke about her had to pause to compose themselves.

"When we didn’t have anything, you were there for us," Barbara Grant said. "You pushed me day after day. You and your family are my family."

SWAG board member Dorothy Thomas presented a plaque in Canton’s honor that will be placed in the playground.

"We should probably name the whole city after her, but we decided to name the playground after her," Thomas said.

The inscription says in part that Canton’s "steadfast commitment to this neighborhood, her love of the children that live in it and her belief that education is the most important gift we can give our children has guided our vision for the Child Center and beyond."

Canton shies away from the spotlight but she did say one word to describe the afternoon.

"Fabulous."
