SIGNING A LANDMARK PHASE ONE TRADE AGREEMENT: Today, President Trump is signing a new, fully-enforceable Phase One Trade Agreement with China.

President Trump is making good on his promise to fix the failed policies of the past and deliver fairer trade for the United States.

This historic agreement will begin to rebalance our vital trade partnership with China and benefit both of our countries.

The signing of this agreement will be an incredible boost for American businesses, farmers, manufacturers, and innovators.

ENACTING CRITICAL REFORMS: China has agreed to make significant structural reforms in a wide range of critical areas.

This agreement will help level the playing field for Americaâ€™s innovators to compete and win.

Importantly, the reforms included in the agreement are fully enforceable and include a strong dispute resolution system to ensure effective implementation and enforcement.

For the first time in any trade agreement, China agreed to end its practice of forcing foreign companies to transfer their technology to Chinese companies in order to gain market access.

China will address numerous longstanding intellectual property concerns in the areas of trade secrets, trademarks, enforcement against pirated and counterfeit goods, and more.

China agreed to strong commitments on currency practices regarding currency devaluations and exchange rates.

The agreement addresses a wide range of trade and investment barriers that have prevented American financial services companies from being able to compete in China.

The agreement addresses structural barriers that have unfairly limited United States food and agricultural exports. The agreement includes significant commitments by China on accepting United States agricultural biotechnology products.



REBALANCING TRADE: This agreement will begin rebalancing our trade relationship with China and provide new opportunity for American businesses and farmers.
