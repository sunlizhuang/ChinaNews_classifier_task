It was US President John F. Kennedy who said: "When written in Chinese, the word crisis is composed of two characters – one represents danger, and the other represents opportunity."

That couldn’t be more apt when dissecting how Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his government have handled the events of the past few weeks. From the devastating bushfires to this week’s rapid escalation of the coronavirus outbreak, there’s been enough danger to fill a year, not a month.

As JFK identified, there has also been political opportunity – some that has been squandered by the PM and his team. But if you’ve noticed the stark difference between Morrison’s lethargic bushfire response in early January and the rapid formulation of a coronavirus plan this week, it’s clear there have been some lessons learned over the course of the month.

It didn’t look like that was the case on Monday when Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne said it was "very important to appreciate that there are limitations to what we can do" when asked about evacuating Australians from Wuhan, China. At that point, it seemed the government was yet again facing an angry electorate that just wanted to Australian citizens protected and didn't care much for the bureaucratic complications.
