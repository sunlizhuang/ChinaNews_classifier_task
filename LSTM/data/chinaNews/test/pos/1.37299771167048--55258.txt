Tourists with protective face masks at Merlion Park in Singapore

CHENNAI: Southeast Asian countries seem to have fallen out of favour among travellers planning trips for the Valentine’s Day weekend, Holi holidays and summer vacation because more cases of novel coronavirus have been detected in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand — among the most popular destinations from Chennai. Instead, the Middle East and Europe have emerged as alternative destinations.This has begun to reflect on airfares. Return fares to Southeast Asian countries have begun to decrease but fares to the Middle East have started to rise for bookings in March.One-way fares on the Chennai-Singapore route are hovering in the range of Rs 5,000–Rs 7,000, while fares to Dubai are in the range of Rs 7,000–Rs 10,000 for travel in March and April. Fares on the Singapore route are expected to decrease further in the coming days.Travel and tour companies too have begun suggesting alternative destinations for travellers because panic has gripped authorities in Singapore after around 18 coronavirus cases were detected.The virus has also begun spreading in Macau, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, Hong Kong and Japan which have emerged as new destinations in the last few years for those who have visited to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. There is more concern among the tourists over visiting these countries because they get many travellers from China.This will be the first time, travellers would be moving away from Southeast Asian nations for summer vacation travel.Basheer Ahmed of Metro Travels said: “Leisure travellers, who used to visit Singapore on weekends have stopped travelling. Only traders and those who have relatives there are travelling. Many who have not booked trips are considering the Middle East and Europe. Europe is an expensive destination.”Anand Menon, brand leader, Travel Tours of FCM Travel Solutions, said that Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Bali because of their proximity and various experiences they offer make for great holiday getaways. Europe could be expensive but group tours may be an option. “Group tours are a great way to holiday especially when you’re going to a place for the first time and want to keep it cost effective.”Since India is the third source market for tourists after China and Indonesia, Singapore Tourism Board has sent out a communication to travel and tour operators and hotels in India highlighting the steps being taken to safeguard people against novel coronavirus to assure them that all measures are being taken at hotels, business venues, cruise terminals and airports.
