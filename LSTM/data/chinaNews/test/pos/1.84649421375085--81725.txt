JAKARTA, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- The relationship between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries will not be affected by the COVID-19 outbreak as the two sides have agreed to strengthen their cooperation in winning the battle against the deadly virus, Chinese ambassador to ASEAN Deng Xijun said here Friday.

Talking to reporters about the Special ASEAN-China Foreign Ministers' Meeting on Coronavirus Disease held Thursday in Laos' capital Vientiane Thursday, the ambassador said that the meeting has delivered a signal to the world that both China and ASEAN are joining hands to contain the disease, safeguard peoples' health of all countries and promote global and regional health resilience.

ASEAN, which was founded in 1967, groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Thursday's meeting was co-chaired by Chinese State Council and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and the Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin and attended by ASEAN Secretary-General Lim Jock Hoi.

"The meeting fully demonstrates firm will and determination of solidarity and support between ASEAN and China in times of difficulty. China-ASEAN friendship and cooperation have withstood the test of time and become much stronger than ever before," Ambassador Deng said.

Apart from having vowed to reduce the impact of the epidemic on socio-economic development of affected countries, Deng said all ministers have agreed to step up the regional cooperation against COVID-19 by sharing information and best practices in a timely manner, including exchanging available epidemiological information, technical guidelines and solutions for epidemic prevention and control, diagnosis, treatment and surveillance.

"Yesterday, China-ASEAN clinical experts held a video conference and exchanged views on dealing with and managing the virus," said Deng.

"All this gives new importance of cooperation on regional public health and prevention of disease," he added. Enditem
