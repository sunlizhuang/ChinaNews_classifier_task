MANILA – Lazada sees a growing market for wedding gowns in the Philippines as more brides look for cheaper alternatives to cut costs.

Neil Trinidad, Lazada Philippines’ chief marketing officer, said they have been getting a lot of wedding gown inquiries after a story about one of their customers went viral online.

The woman shared with the wedding website Bride and Breakfast last January that she ordered her gown at Lazada’s 11/11 sale as she does not want to “splurge a lot of money for a gown that will be used for one time and just a few hours.”

“The lady that was featured in that story bought her wedding gown from our global collection. It was a beautiful wedding gown that was shipped from China,” Trinidad said in an interview with ABS-CBN News on Wednesday.

“It’s really quite affordable,” he added. “I think the wedding gown that she got was under P15,000.”

Custom-made wedding gowns in the Philippines usually start at P50,000, with prices going as high as P1 million for intricate pieces by popular designers.

Trinidad considers the sudden interest of Filipino Lazada users in wedding gowns a “pleasant surprise” as they strive to get more brands on board.

He hopes that the trend will help more people see online marketplaces as a source of high-quality, low-priced items.

“We need to have an assortment of brands and products that appeal to different needs. We really want to be a one-stop destination for anything related to lifestyle, and that story made us realize the potential of selling wedding dresses on the platform. Who would have thought, right?” Trinidad said.

WOMEN’S FESTIVAL

Women – particularly those aged 18 to 35 – are considered the most active shoppers of Lazada here in the Philippines, according to Trinidad.

On average, the online marketplace has 4 million users in one day – and more than half of them are females.

To better accommodate their biggest market, Lazada launched its second Women’s Festival for the whole month of February, and a new online destination called Beauty by LazMall that boasts of tech innovations like digital makeup filters.

The Women’s Festival is divided into four categories – beauty, fashion, home and living, and mom and baby – with deals and discounts offered on weekends.

“We have seen that beauty and fashion, specifically, are among our fastest growing categories,” Trinidad said.

“Seeing that, we realized that we need to offer women a special festival where they can find products that appeal to their different needs.”
