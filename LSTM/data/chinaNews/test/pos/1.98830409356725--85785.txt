Payout ratios

Dividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Guangzhou Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Holdings paid out 22% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. Given the low payout ratio, it is hard to envision the dividend coming under threat, barring a catastrophe.

In addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Guangzhou Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Holdings paid out 110% of its free cash last year. Cash flows can be lumpy, but this dividend was not well covered by cash flow. Guangzhou Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Holdings paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough free cash flow to cover the dividend. Were it to repeatedly pay dividends that were not well covered by cash flow, this could be a risk to Guangzhou Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Holdings's ability to maintain its dividend.

While the above analysis focuses on dividends relative to a company's earnings, we do note Guangzhou Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Holdings's strong net cash position, which will let it pay larger dividends for a time, should it choose.
