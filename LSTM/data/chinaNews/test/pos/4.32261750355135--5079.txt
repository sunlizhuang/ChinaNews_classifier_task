Vanguard has received the regulatory green light to provide investment advice in the U.K., Citywire reports.

The fund giant’s head of Europe, Sean Hagerty, said in message to clients that Vanguard has secured approval from the Financial Conduct Authority to provide retail advice and is “exploring the launch of a direct to consumer financial advice offer in the UK,” according to the publication.

It may take a while for the service to launch. Hagerty said it was in its early stages and “there is not currently a timescale for bringing a proposition to market.”

Vanguard opened its U.K. funds business in 2009, and in 2017 launched an online platform offering U.K. residents access to mutual funds and ETFs.

Comments Hagerty made in his message suggest the U.K. investment advice service might be a hybrid robo offering combining automated portfolio management with access to human advisors. That’s the model followed by Vanguard’s successful Personal Advisor Services in the U.S.

“The provision of advice will never be one-size-fits all, and it is important that investors are able to access advice in a manner that suits their particular preferences,” Hagerty was quoted saying in the message.

The company is expanding internationally in the other direction. Last month, it said it was partnering with Chinese fintech company Ant Financial Services Group to offer Chinese investors an investment advisory service with a low account minimum of 800 yuan (about $113).
