North Dakota’s largest farm organization says the signing of a partial trade agreement between the U.S. and China is a “first step forward after many steps back.”

“We hope this first phase of the deal is real and not just rhetoric,” North Dakota Farmers Union President Mark Watne said. “The trade war the president said would be easy has been extremely difficult. Farmers and ranchers paid the price.”

President Donald Trump signed a trade agreement Wednesday with China that is expected to boost exports from U.S. farmers and manufacturers and is aimed at lowering tensions in a long-running dispute between the economic powers. The agreement is being described as “phase one" of a larger negotiation focusing on tensions in the U.S.-China trade relationship.

Watne said he was “cautiously optimistic, but the agreement doesn’t cover our lost sales to China, and it will take time to regain our market share and restore our reputation as a reliable trading partner.”

U.S. agricultural exports to China fell from $21.4 billion in 2016 to $9.2 billion in 2018, according to Farmers Union. Soybeans, which have long been the top overall U.S. export to China, fell from $14.2 to $3.1 billion over the same time period.
