— President Donald Trump will sign his trade deal with Mexico and Canada on Wednesday, but the USMCA is still months from going into effect. Canada still has to ratify the agreement and then all three countries must meet implementation obligations first.

— U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is skipping an annual trade ministers meeting in Davos today that will focus on the future of the WTO Appellate Body. U.S. Ambassador to the WTO Dennis Shea will attend instead, even though Lighthizer has been in Davos all week for other meetings.

— The Trump administration is eyeing a trade deal with the United Kingdom before the end of 2020, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday. Talks could start as soon as February.

Driving the Day

USMCA STILL HAS A WAYS TO GO AFTER TRUMP SIGNATURE: Trump will sign the revised USMCA into law at a White House ceremony Wednesday, an administration spokesman confirmed Thursday night, but his legislative achievement may not enter into force until after the 2020 election.

Canada must still ratify the pact, and is expected to do so by April. But passage of USMCA in Canada does not trigger any sort of clock for the deal to go into effect.

Implementation is the key: After ratification by Canada, the three countries must work to check off all the obligations outlined in the deal that must be met before the deal can take effect. (The U.S. and Mexico are already getting started in tackling their obligations while they wait on Canada.) Once they have completed all required procedures, the countries will notify each other in an exchange of letters. Then, the deal will enter into force about 60 days later.

There will be lots of behind-the-scenes talks within and between each country to ensure the U.S., Mexico and Canada are living up to their commitments. That could take months, especially when it comes to challenging issues such as making sure Mexico complies with its major labor commitments and that all three countries have the new automotive rules of origin ready to go when the deal takes effect.

“Implementation is a hard thing. It’s what I consider one of the most underrated parts of negotiating trade agreements,” a former administration official told POLITICO.

A question of timing: Still, the Trump administration is aiming for the deal to go into effect by July, a timeline that the former official said is "historically ambitious," but not impossible.

LIGHTHIZER SKIPS DAVOS MINI-MINISTERIAL: USTR on Thursday confirmed that Lighthizer will not attend a meeting in Davos, Switzerland, today to discuss the future of the WTO Appellate Body and other pending issues.

Lighthizer was in Davos earlier this week, along with Trump and other administration officials. But rather than stay for the annual trade ministers meeting hosted by the Swiss government, Lighthizer will send Shea instead.

Swiss State Secretary for Economic Affairs Marie-Gabrielle Ineichen-Fleisch and WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo will brief reporters today on the discussions, which are expected to include goals for the WTO’s 12th ministerial conference in Kazakhstan in June.

Blast from the past: U.S. officials missed last year’s gathering, which occurred on the last day of the 35-day U.S. government shutdown, while China, the European Union, India, Japan, Canada, Australia, Russia and 25 other WTO members sent representatives.

BIDEN’S TRADE POLICY STARTS AT HOME: Former Vice President Joe Biden is fleshing out his trade policy this week, vowing to renew and revamp America’s relationships with its allies in order to create a united front that can take on global challenges, China among them.

But before he looks abroad, Biden is pledging first to strengthen the U.S.’s middle class through “enormous investments” in areas like infrastructure, education and health care that will “equip Americans to succeed in the global economy — with a foreign policy for the middle class.”

Paging progressives: In a piece for Foreign Affairs magazine that published online Thursday, the free trade-oriented Democrat sought to appeal to more progressive members of the party when he emphasized his belief in “fair trade” and promised to include strong labor, environmental and enforcement provisions in any future agreements.

At the same time, he maintained a firmly anti-protectionist view. “The wrong thing to do,” he wrote, “is to put our heads in the sand and say no more trade deals.”

Plugging TPP? Biden, the chief cheerleader of the Trans-Pacific Partnership under the Obama administration, did not specifically name that agreement in his piece. But in an argument that in many ways echoes the Obama administration’s thinking on the TPP, Biden advocated an approach toward China that involves building “a united front of U.S. allies and partners” to tackle some of Beijing’s more aggressive behaviors.

“When we join together with fellow democracies, our strength more than doubles,” Biden wrote. “China can’t afford to ignore more than half the global economy.”

MNUCHIN: U.S.-U.K. TRADE DEAL ‘DONE THIS YEAR’: It seems like a tall order. But the Trump administration wants a free trade deal with the United Kingdom by the end of December, Mnuchin said Thursday in an interview on CNBC that also seemed to downplay the possibility of tariffs on auto imports from Europe.

“The president is very focused ... on Europe,” Mnuchin said. “The good news is we have seen a lot of investments in the U.S. from the European car companies. But the president wants to make sure that we have free and fair and reciprocal trade in Europe. And by the way, we’re very focused on a U.K. Free Trade Agreement, which we hope to get done this year as well.”

The Treasury chief’s comments came the same day the U.K. Parliament passed legislation paving the way for Brexit on Jan. 31. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected in Washington next month to kick off talks with Trump, although no date has been announced. USTR published its negotiating objectives for a U.K. trade deal last year, but Britain has yet to release its own goals for the agreement.

TRUMP NEARING DECISION IN TITANIUM SPONGE PROBE: Trump is expected to decide in the next five to eight weeks whether to restrict imports of titanium sponge, a key metal used by the military, on national security grounds. A decision to take that action could complicate U.S. efforts to reach a broader trade agreement with Japan, the principal source of titanium sponge imports.

Titanium Metals Corp., also known as TIMET, asked for the protection last year under the same Section 232 provision that Trump used to impose duties on steel and aluminum imports. The Commerce Department launched an investigation in March and is believed to have delivered its recommendations to the White House by its deadline in late November. However, the Commerce Department’s main press office declined to comment on the status of the report. Trump has 90 days after receiving the Commerce report to make a decision.

Titanium sponge is the critical element of titanium metal, which is used to make parts for aircraft structures and engines, munition systems, ground combat vehicles and ships. The U.S. already has a 15 percent tariff on titanium sponge and a 5.5 percent tariff on related products. That is higher than most U.S. tariffs on industrial goods.

TRUMP TIGHTENS WASHER IMPORT RESTRICTIONS: Trump said Thursday evening that he was adjusting import restrictions that he imposed on residential washing machines in early 2018 to reduce problems caused by peak import periods.

Under Trump’s initial import “safeguard” action, which was imposed at the request of Whirlpool, the first 1.2 million units of imported finished washers faced a tariff of 20 percent in year one, 18 percent in year two and 16 percent in year three. Any imports beyond that level faced higher declining tariffs of 50 percent, 45 percent and 40 percent over the same three-year period.

However, import data shows the 1.2 million lower-duty quota was quickly filled in both 2018 and 2019, undermining the effectiveness of the relief, Trump said in the proclamation. To address that concern, “I have decided to allocate, on a quarterly basis, within-quota quantities of 1.2 million washers during the third year of the action, beginning February 7, 2020,” he said.

SENIOR WAY AND MEANS STAFFER REACHES MILESTONE: Angela Ellard on Thursday marked her 25th anniversary with the House Ways and Means Committee, a period spanning four presidential administrations and big changes in U.S. trade policy. Ellard, who is chief trade counsel and Republican staff director for the Trade Subcommittee, joined the panel when NAFTA was barely one year old and the World Trade Organization had just been created. Since then, she’s been involved in every congressional trade fight in the past quarter-century.

That includes bitter battles over trade promotion authority in both 2002 and 2015, as well as votes on a string of free trade agreements beginning with Jordan in 2001 and ending with South Korea in 2011. More recently though, Ellard was forced to mostly watch from the sidelines during negotiations between House Democrats and the White House on the final version of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement that was put up for a vote. Born in Minneapolis, Ellard went to school at the other end of the Mississippi River and graduated from Tulane Law School in 1986.
