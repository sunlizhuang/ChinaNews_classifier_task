As we approach Lunar New Year, we look back at some of the biggest milestones in Imperial-Chinese collaboration from the last 12 months.

Imperial is the UK’s top STEM research collaborator with China, publishing more than 900 joint research papers every year.

Our Chinese community is growing every year and we currently have more than 220 staff making scientific breakthroughs, more than 3,100 students at our London campus and more than 9,000 alumni living in China.

Here are some of the highlights of the last year:

China’s Minister of Science and Technology visited Imperial

China’s Minister of Science and Technology Wang Zhigang visited Imperial to meet our scientists and students.

The visit showcased Imperial’s deep ties with China as well as the College’s research strengths, international collaborations, and industry partnerships.
