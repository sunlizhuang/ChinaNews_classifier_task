BEIJING, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping said Monday China has the confidence that its development will be even stronger in 2020.

Xi made the remarks when holding talks with Kiribati's President Taneti Mamau at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

Xi said the new year began with a mixture of good news and bad news, and unstable and uncertain factors are increasing.

"Mr. President's visit to China comes as Beijing welcomes the first snow of the new year. As the Chinese saying goes, 'a timely snowfall offers promise for a fruitful harvest,' and China has the confidence that its development will be even better in 2020," Xi said. Enditem
