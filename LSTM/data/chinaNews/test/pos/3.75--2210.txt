HONG KONG (China Daily/ANN): Hong Kong Tourism Board announced on Tuesday (Jan 7) that a carnival instead of a float parade will be held in the West Kowloon Cultural District from Jan 25-28 to celebrate the upcoming Spring Festival.

The annual float parade has been held to mark the Chinese New Year in the past 25 years.

The event will begin at 2pm and end at 8pm each day except for Jan 26 when it will close three hours earlier. Admission is free.

One of the highlights of the carnival will be a joint performance by 48 troupes from Hong Kong and abroad.

The board's President Pang Yiu-kai said the carnival marks a new way the Spring Festival will be celebrated in Hong Kong.

He hopes Hong Kong people will share the festive joy with their friends and families, while helping to spread positive messages to overseas visitors. - China Daily/Asia News Network
