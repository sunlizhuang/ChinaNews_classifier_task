Movie stars Ethan Hawke and Isabella Rossellini, as well as filmmakers, visual artists and a few scientists, will be serving on the juries of the 2020 Sundance Film Festival.

The slates for this year’s seven juries were announced Tuesday by Robert Redford’s Sundance Institute, which runs the festival.

The juries will decide award winners in the U.S. and World Cinema competitions for both dramatic films and documentaries, and for short films. A one-person jury selects the Next Innovator Award; past Next jurors have been fashion icon RuPaul and avant-garde musician Laurie Anderson.

One jury has already done its job for this year’s festival. The jury that selects the Alfred P. Sloan Prize, which goes to a film that covers themes of science and technology, is going to “Tesla,” director Michael Almereyda’s biography of the inventor Nikolai Tesla, portrayed by Hawke.

Most of the juries’ awards will be given out Saturday, Feb. 1, at the festival’s closing night ceremony. Here are the slates of this year’s Sundance juries:
