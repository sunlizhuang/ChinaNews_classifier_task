TIANJIN, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- The fourth World Intelligence Congress (WIC), set to open in north China's Tianjin Municipality from April 23 to 26, will highlight innovative applications, according to the organizer on Tuesday.

The four-day event will feature a series of activities including forums, exhibitions and competitions highlighting intelligent experiences.

Enterprises, research institutions and universities can showcase their cutting-edge technologies and products at eight exhibition zones involving intelligent manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, big data and more.

Six competitions will be held during the event, such as the World Smart Driving Challenge and China Industrial Innovation Application Competition.

In the previous WICs in 2017, 2018 and 2019, about 300,000 visitors from both home and abroad gathered in Tianjin to discuss the world's most frontier trends of intelligent technologies.

A total of 126 agreements with an estimated investment of over 108 billion yuan (about 15.7 billion U.S. dollars) were inked last year.
