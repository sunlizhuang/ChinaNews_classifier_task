FairPrice Xtra Has Cute Mickey & Minnie Mouse Goodies To Celebrate Year Of The Rat

Back in the day, bringing a Mickey Mouse lunchbox to school was all the rage. I remember in primary school, there was no shortage of mice in the classrooms – except they were cartoonish and not actual rodents.

Stationery, cups, notebooks – whatever you laid your gaze upon, there would be the visage of Mickey.

Come 2020, and Mickey & Minnie are back – although it’s debatable if they ever left – thanks to the Year of the Rat, with FairPrice Xtra’s special Chinese New Year promotions.

FairPrice Xtra is celebrating Chinese New Year by offering customers the chance to get some exclusive Mickey & Minnie Mouse saucer plates and tiffin carriers.

Redeem limited edition Mickey & Minnie Mouse plates

This Mickey & Minnie Mouse Saucer Plate will not only ring in the Lunar New Year but also add to your Mickey collection – killing 2 birds with 1 stone.

The plate will belong to you with a minimum $30 spend on participating Mickey/Minnie Mouse products in a single FairPrice Xtra receipt, so you can shop for your CNY goodies while you’re at it.

There’ll be a total of 4 designs, one released each Thursday, and they’ll be available until Wed (29 Jan), so you can schedule your weekly grocery shopping then*.

Redemption can be done at the Customer Service Counter by presenting your receipt.

*Terms and conditions apply.

Save the Earth using Mickey & Minnie tiffin carrier at $29.90 with $50 spend

If 2 of your New Year’s Resolutions are to eat more healthily and go green, a tingkat (tiffin carrier) might just be the thing you need to fulfill them.

The tingkat contains 3 tiers, perfect for storing not only your hopes and dreams, but also homemade lunch crafted with love.

These themed carriers can be bought for $29.90 each, with a minimum spend of $50 in a single receipt.

The receipt must contain at least 1 Mickey or Minnie Mouse product in-store, such as this special Kit Kat sharebag with Mickey/Minnie fortune container, at $12.40 each.

Similarly to the plates, each receipt entitles customers to up to 2 purchases of the tiffin carrier per day, while stocks last.*

*Terms and conditions apply.

On certain dates, you can also pick up a free CNY Prosperity Bag with the same minimum spend of $50, so be sure to time your grocery shopping if you don’t want to miss out.
