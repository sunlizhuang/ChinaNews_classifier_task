PLEASANT HILL, Iowa - Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is coming to Des Moines next month.

The social conservative political organization The Family Leader announced Thursday that Pompeo will speak at the downtown Marriot on March 21st.

He'll be joined in his appearance by American/Israeli communications strategist Joel Rosenberg, who is also an author.

The event is being billed as “An Evening of International Impact”.

“As tensions mount in the Middle East, we wanted to set apart an evening to begin a conversation,” said Family Leader President and CEO Bob Vander Plaats in a statement. “We have invited Rosenberg and Secretary Pompeo to sit down with us and discuss the current global situation, America’s role, and the impact our faith has on these circumstances.”

Pompeo was last in Iowa to promote President Trump's trade policies in March of last year. He was joined in that trip by former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, who is now the U.S. Ambassador to China.

Pompeo served in the U.S. Army and is a former Republican Congressman fro Kansas. President Trump appointed him to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency before the President appointed him as Secretary of State in December of 2018.

Tickets for The Family Leader's event with Pompeo and Vander Plaats go on sale Friday.
