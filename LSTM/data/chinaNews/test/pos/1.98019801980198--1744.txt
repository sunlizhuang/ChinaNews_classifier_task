U.S. President Donald Trump says phase 1 of the trade deal with China would be signed on January 15 at the White House, though considerable confusion remains about the details of the agreement.

Mr. Trump on Tuesday said he would sign the deal with high level representatives of China and later travel to Beijing to begin talks on the next phase.

The deal, struck earlier this month, is expected to reduce tariffs and boost Chinese purchases of American farm, energy and manufactured goods, while addressing some disputes over intellectual property.
