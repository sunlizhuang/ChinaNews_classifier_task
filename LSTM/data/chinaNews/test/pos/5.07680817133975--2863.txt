"We are now one step away from unleashing the competitiveness of America's farmers and ranchers with our two largest trading partners thanks to today's Senate Finance Committee vote. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will protect our valuable trade relationships with our nearest neighbors and return certainty to our markets. We urge immediate approval by the full Senate to deliver a much-needed win for agriculture," he said. "The challenges farmers and ranchers faced in 2019 are no secret, but it's a new year and we are eager for new opportunities to compete, building on the progress with Japan and the pending announcement of a new China agreement. We hope the USMCA will be a model for future U.S. trade agreements as the administration pursues a level playing field around the globe for our farmers and ranchers."
