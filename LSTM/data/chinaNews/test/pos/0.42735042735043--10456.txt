The 21st century saw the advent of a revolutionary mode of business - ecommerce. It gave consumers the power to order all things under the sun, be it food or goods, without getting off one's seat, and it has changed the way the world operates now.

While in India for the company’s SMBhav summit, Bezos announced that Amazon would be making an “incremental investment of $1 billion in digitising small and medium businesses” to a packed audience of SMB entrepreneurs.
