Daxing International Airport will be tested as it readies for the Spring Festival travel rush for the first time starting this Friday. During the 40-day travel rush, the new airport is anticipating 1.9 million inbound and outbound passengers with an average 15% increase in the number of flights per day.

Daxing International has made appropriate adjustments to handle the rapidly increasing passenger volume during the travel rush, said Tan Zhanfeng, deputy manager of the airport's operation management department. These measures include increasing the number of domestic flight counters, opening more security check channels, and guiding passengers to self-check-in service. In case of bad weather, additional shuttle buses and taxis will be added to ensure no passenger is stranded during the travel rush.

In addition, some airlines are offering check-in service at the Caoqiao Subway Station. It takes 19 minutes to go from Caoqiao to Daxing International by subway.

Meanwhile, passengers can immerse themselves in the festive atmosphere in the airport while waiting for their flights. In addition to festive decorations, Daxing International will host a wide range of activities to celebrate the Spring Festival. The airport will work with cultural institutions such as the National Museum and the China Crafts Development Research Center to hold a special exhibition on Chinese calligraphy, as well as a Lunar New Year Craftsman Market where passengers can interact with craftsmen and inheritors of intangible cultural heritage.

The 2020 Spring Festival travel rush lasts from this Friday to Feb. 18 for a total of 40 days. The total passenger volume of railways, airlines, and highways is expected to be 45.73 million in Beijing.
