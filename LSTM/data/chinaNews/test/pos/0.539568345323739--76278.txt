Two Irish people have tested positive for the Coronavirus while onboard a quarantined cruise ship.

It is believed that Tanaiste Simon Coveney plans to update Cabinet later today following the efforts of officials to assist Irish people.

The two infected Irish were onboard the Princess Diamond Cruise Ship which has stopped in Yokahama, Japan. They are both due to receive treatment in a hospital in Japan.

Sources have suggested that the two passengers hold dual citizenship between Ireland and another European country, and are not usually resident in Ireland.

The Irish Embassy in Tokyo is in consistent contact with the two citizens to assist in any way possible.

Though Ireland remains uninfected, 21 Irish people abroad have been affected or displaced by the virus.

15 Irish citizens were onboard cruise ships amidst the outbreak including the two now infected. Another six people have been sent home from Wuhan China to Ireland since the outbreak.

The Department of Foreign Affairs is helping all Irish citizens affected by the virus both directly and indirectly.

Nine Irish passengers are currently onboard the Westerdam Cruise Ship currently docked in Sihanoukville, Cambodia. While two have already returned home, the remaining seven are currently being screened for the virus.

In a statement, Mr. Coveney said that his officials are liaising with our Embassies overseas regarding the outbreak.

‘The safety and welfare of our citizens overseas remain our priority. In these efforts we are working hand-in-hand with the Department of Health and other relevant Departments and Agencies, both in Ireland and internationally., to ensure that all the appropriate advice and precautions are in place’ he wrote.

‘Ireland’s international support is complementary to our domestic preparedness efforts led by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. We all share the overriding goal of minimising the impact of this epidemic.’

The Irish Government has already allocated €500,000 to the World Health Organization to work towards detaining the virus.
