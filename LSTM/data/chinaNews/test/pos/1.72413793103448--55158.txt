The popular Jersey City Filipino grocery store FilStop will close in about a week, according to owner Erwin Santos.

Santos said financial issues were the reason for the closure.

Santos' parents opened the 4,000-square-foot store at 683 Newark Avenue in 1973. Santos grew up working at FilStop and took over about 12 years ago.

"I'm just thankful," said Santos. "The support I've been getting online from customers is unbelievable. The ability to bring those memories from home. It was a great ride for me."

A second Clifton location both opened and closed in 2019.

FilStop was one of the largest Filipino/Asian grocery stores in the Northeast. It sold hard-to-find Filipino food items including bottled bagoong, bihon, canton, misua, banana ketchup and lechon sauce in-store and online.

The store is currently holding a liquidation sale, with most of its items 70 percent off.
