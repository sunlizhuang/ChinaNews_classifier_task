TWO Anglesey school cooks will go head-to-head in a prestigious culinary competition.

The search for LACA School Chef of the Year 2020 is underway with the competition having reached the secondary stage - the live regional finals.

The Wales heat will see the Anglesey duo of Jo Cox of Ysgol Pentraeth and Sian Pritchard of Ysgol Henblas battle it out to be crowned the Welsh School Chef of the Year for 2020.

They will come up against Jane Jones, Nicola Pagano and Tracey Smart in the finals at Newtown College, Powys on January 16.

Looking forward to it, Jo, who also took part in last year’s competition, said: “I was a bag of nerves last time around, but this year I'm feeling ready.

“Just like last year, I've been doing trial runs with my favourite 'customers' at Ysgol Gynradd Pentraeth and they seem to be big fans of what I'm going to be making at the competition."

For her main course, Jo will be making Lobscouse with a twist, using both beef and lentils to create a 'half and half dish', served with a bread roll. For dessert, she will be making a chocolate beetroot cake layered with cream cheese frosting.

Competition newcomer Sian, who is 45 and from Trefor on Anglesey added: “I'm so ecstatic to be taking part in this competition and to be coming up against some amazing cooks. This will be my first time in the competition so I'm just looking forward to the experience more than anything.

“I've always loved cooking, ever since a young age when I used to help my mum when we lived on a farm.

“I used to take everything on board from her and I've carried on with the same passion ever since."

Sian will be creating a toad in the hole dish for her main course and a 'Vicky's trifle' for dessert - a traditional recipe which has been in her family for generations.

Competitors have 90 minutes to prepare, cook and present four portions each of a two course imaginative meal suitable for serving en masse to 11 year olds in primary or secondary schools.

In addition to the kudos of winning the national title, the 2020 champion will receive a £1000 cash prize and the LACA 2020 School Chef of the Year trophy. He or she will also be awarded a work experience trip and an invitation to a calendar of high profile catering industry engagements between 2020 - 2021.

The national second and third place winners will receive cash prizes of £500 and £300 respectively.
