Erika Macapagal is looking forward to pursuing a career in which she will help children to learn and develop.

Ms Macapagal, from Manor Lakes, graduated from the Kangan Institute with a diploma in early childhood education and care last month.

During the graduation ceremony, Kangan presented Ms Macapagal – who hails from the Philippines – with an Outstanding International Student Award for Community Services.

“I was ecstatic, I really didn’t expect the award,” she said. Ms Macapagal said that her future plans were to pursue a bachelor’s degree in her chosen field, and eventually become the director of a childcare centre.

She said that she was inspired to become an educator, after she began tutoring children from China online three years ago.

“I love the feeling of being able to be a part of a child’s life, being their guide, their friend and their mentor,” she said.

“I am determined to help the children reach their full potential and be a good future adult.”

Ms Macapagal said that she began studying at Kangan in July 2018.

“All of these would not have happened if not for my family’s unconditional love, they are my number one critic and supporter, they are the best and I can’t thank them enough for everything that they do for me.”
