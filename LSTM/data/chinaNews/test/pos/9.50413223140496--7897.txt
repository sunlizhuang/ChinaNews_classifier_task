Pan Pacific Xiamen hosted a Charity Art Event "Building Your Art Dream" on 10 January, 2020, and invited local media, UOB Bank, Singapore Consulate, Singapore SilkAir, Xiamen International School, Xiamen University, Xiamen Academy of arts and design, Fuzhou University, and many other guests participated in the event.

Executive Director of Pan Pacific Hotels Group-Ms. Wee Wei Ling came with her beloved art creation "The Art of Journey" and shared with us. At the same time, she also represented Pan Pacific Hotels Group to promote corporate social responsibility, Pan Pacific Hotel Group corporate social responsibility is manifested in three aspects: People, Sustainability and Art.

These include a diverse representation of works from watercolours to traditional ink paintings, including master ink painter and seal-carver Han Tian Heng's "Four Seasons", and the imaginative and avant-garde paintings of female painter Shao Fei. In view of the upcoming Lunar New Year, the works on display were carefully curated to evoke the energy and hope of springtime, which brought forth an optimistic and delightful ambience.

We received total CNY 22,750 (SGD 4,445) and donated it to Xiamen Special Education School in the name of "Pan Pacific Xiamen".

The Charity Art Event cooperated with the Xiamen Special Education School. 25 students created 25 works around the artistic dream in their hearts, 5 of which were used for exhibition and selection, and 8 works with Pan Pacific Hotels Group collections are exhibited together, and the remaining 20 are used for charity auctions.

In the end, Lin Qian's "Climbing" was unanimously recognized by the art teacher and Ms. Wee Wei Ling, and became the outstanding work of the night.
