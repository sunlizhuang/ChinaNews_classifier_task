LONGVIEW — A tentative trade agreement between the U.S. and China could restore a major grain trading partner for local ports in the new year, potentially wrapping up a 21-month trade war between those two countries.

The “phase one” agreement, which was released Dec. 13 and slated for a presidential signature Jan. 15, cuts some U.S.-imposed tariffs on China and sets goals for China to significantly increase purchases of America products and services over the next two years, including a record amount of U.S. agricultural products, according to reports by Reuters.

But despite China’s promise to buy an average of $40 billion of American farm products annually over the next two years — nearly double pre-trade war numbers — local port officials are cautious and a bit skeptical. They predict that grain exports likely will recover gradually, and they’re not expecting a huge surge of additional business any time soon.

“I think our expectation would be to get back to normal year if this deal goes through,” said Christian Clay, Port of Longview’s business development director. “I think the stock market has shown this is a positive step forward … but it will be a slow recovery.”

Grain handling operations at the port created nearly 500 jobs in 2018, according to an economic impact study. And grain exports account for almost 25 percent of the port’s annual operating revenue.
