The Chinese ambassador, His Excellency Ma Jianchun on 20 February 2020 met with Hon. Badara Joof, the minister of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology.



They talked about the developments of China’s combat against COVID-19 outbreak, as well as safeguarding the health of Gambian students living in China during these trying times.

Ambassador Ma briefed Minister Joof on the current distribution of Gambian students in China, and the multifaceted measures taken by the Chinese government, schools, and residential communities to prevent them from infection and other assistance rendered for their daily needs. He stressed that the Chinese government considered the health and safety of all foreigners in China equally important as that of Chinese citizens, and no Gambian national in China has been infected so far. Ambassador Ma took Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in Wuhan as an example, pointing out that measures taken by the school included frequent disinfection in campus especially in residential areas, distributing health necessities to students, delivering free meals three times per day to students’ dormitories, providing shopping and delivery assistance, and so on.
