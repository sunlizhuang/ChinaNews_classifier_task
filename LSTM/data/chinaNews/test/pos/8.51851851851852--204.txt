Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday wrapped up his state visit to Myanmar, the first of its kind in 19 years and Xi's first foreign trip in 2020.

The two-day visit constitutes not only a new milestone in China-Myanmar relations, but testifies to China's resolve to seek joint development with its neighbors on the principles of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness.

China and Myanmar, two close neighbors linked by shared mountains and rivers, enjoy a long history of friendly exchanges and have witnessed the sound development of their bilateral relationship since the two countries established diplomatic ties 70 years ago.

Both initiators and advocates of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, China and Myanmar have set an example of countries of different sizes forging ahead with mutually beneficial cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual respect.

Recent years have seen frequent high-level exchanges and a lot of interaction between the people of China and Myanmar. China staunchly supports Myanmar in choosing a development path suited to its own national conditions and its efforts to promote peace and the reconciliation process.

Aimed at further strengthening the "Paukphaw" (fraternal) friendship, Xi's visit has given fresh momentum to strengthening political mutual trust and enriching the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between the two neighbors. Both countries have reached consensus on building a China-Myanmar community with a shared future and created a new blueprint for bilateral ties.

Underpinned by mutual trust and understanding, trade and economic cooperation are expected to continue to flourish, which will further enhance inter-connectivity and bring more tangible benefits for the peoples of both countries.

With Xi's visit, new vigor has been injected into bilateral economic exchanges to drive common development and foster shared prosperity.

Mutual benefit is the foundation on which China cooperates with other countries, in particular with its neighbors. By accelerating the building of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor and expanding Belt and Road cooperation, the two countries are creating an increasing number of concrete benefits for their people.

China and Myanmar enjoy economic complementarity. There is huge potential to be tapped through a series of key cooperation programs including the Kyaukpyu Special Economic Zone, the China-Myanmar Border Economic Cooperation Zone and New Yangon City.

These programs will contribute to improving local infrastructure, such as transport and electricity, and spurring economic development in Myanmar. Through closer economic ties, China can benefit from them as well.

Besides, advancing cultural and people-to-people exchanges is also an aim, which will help carry forward the time-tested friendship and strengthen public support for the friendly ties.

As 2020 is designated as the China-Myanmar Year of Culture and Tourism, an increasing number of Chinese tourists are expected to visit the Southeast Asian country, which boasts a splendid culture and enchanting scenery. Through such exchanges, the two peoples will without a doubt grow closer.

The relationship between China and Myanmar, two close neighbors that share weal and woe, has now entered a new era. The two countries will build on the momentum created by Xi's visit and stride together towards a brighter, shared future.
