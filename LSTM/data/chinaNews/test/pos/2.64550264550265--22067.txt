In December the Taiwan Tourism Bureau opened its first London headquarters – the second European centre after Frankfurt – to bolster UK visitor numbers.



“The UK is the largest outbound market in Europe to Taiwan. We hope that the opening of the office in London will help travel agencies and tour operators work closely with Taiwan to develop a tailor-made programme for UK visitors,” said Joe Y. Chou, director-general of the Taiwan Tourism Bureau.



By the close of 2019, Taiwan had welcomed more than 70,000 UK arrivals – an 8% year-on-year growth from January to October.

“It’s looking likely the destination will reach new heights in 2020.”

Now, with a new strategy promoting adventure options, Taiwan is hopeful of reaching 100,000.



“Under the Taiwan Tourism 2020 Plan, the tourism bureau has initiated a theme-based promotion. [Themes] include eco-tourism, bay tourism, small-town roaming and mountain tourism,” explained Chou.
