We all have a smart phone, but have you ever heard of a smart bra? Well, courtesy of Triumph, they're about to be a thing.

The Woman & Home fashion team were given the chance this January to trial Triumph’s new innovative ‘Fit Smart ’ bra, and honestly we’re gobsmacked with how comfortable it is, while still providing a great natural shape and support. Not to mention how cool it looks.

Sian Thomas, Global Head of Creative Design at Triumph says: “This season sees the launch of the revolutionary Fit Smart bra, available in four sizes, with an intelligent support system that moulds to women’s unique shapes. With customers searching out more personalised solutions, we wanted to create a new innovation that adapts to personal shapes but still delivers best-in-class support and looks beautiful.”

What makes the Triumph fit smart bra so exciting?

Triumph have been designing bras for over 100 years, and developed this bra after the overwhelming feedback they had from many customers that the focus should be on comfort.

With that in mind, Triumph engineered an intelligent 4D-engineered stretch lace. It moves and adapts to a woman’s body. Research shows that we all have one breast larger than the other and that we can change up to a cup size during the course of the month – the idea behind this 4D stretch lace is that it constantly adapts to the wearer’s body throughout the day and month.

Another big plus for many will be the fact it’s a non-wired bra. Traditionally a non-wired bra meant ‘less support’ or a ‘sausage effect shape’ but that’s not the case with the Fit Smart bra. As well as the 4D stretch lace the bra has 4D stretch foam cup’s, which create a natural, round and flattering bust shape that claim to support all boob sizes, big and small.

The elastic supportive straps adapt and move with the body too, and the bra has a 4-hook fastener provides further adaptability. We were pleasantly surprised with how thin the straps were on the larger size bras, whilst still giving great support.

All this clever technology means the bra comes in just four simple sizes, which Triump say are guaranteed to fit every woman who measures between a 32a – 40e. The innovative fit claims to take the fuss out of sizing, with the bra adapting to your shape and size fluctuation.

Want to try one? The new Smart bra will launch in March 2020. It will be available in 5 different colours and will retail at £40. It will be available online direct from Triumph, or from suppliers that will include John Lewis, House of Fraser and Debenhams.

We really recommend that you try it. We have, and we haven’t taken it off since (we’re not going to divulge how long it’s been exactly, but safe to say we should probably wash it!). We’ve even slept in it and can guarantee it feels invisible.

We’ll be racing out to buy more when they launch in March.
