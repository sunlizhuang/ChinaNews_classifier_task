OnePlus has announced it was the most popular premium smartphone vendor in India last year, citing market research collected by Counterpoint.

In a blog entry on its Community forum, OnePlus founder and CEO Pete Lau said the Shenzhen-based firm held 33 percent of India's premium smartphone segment. Additionally, Lau declared OnePlus became the first premium smartphone brand to ship more than two million devices in India within a single year, which is pretty significant for a five-year-old firm.

All in all, OnePlus claims to have sold more than 5 million devices in India to date â€“ a country with a population of over 1.3 billion that's become increasingly important for the Shenzhen firm. In fact, last year saw OnePlus release its first TV exclusively in India, signifying just how important it sees the market as part of its success going forward.

Counterpoint's data said India smartphone shipments grew 29 percent in the year, of which the fastest-growing segment was for "ultra-premium" handsets with a 63 percent increase year-over-year.
