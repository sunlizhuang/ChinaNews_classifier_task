UK: Tesco beats rivals with 0.1% Christmas sales rise

Tesco, Britain’s biggest retailer, ground out a 0.1% rise in underlying sales in its home market during what it said was a “subdued” Christmas for consumer spending. Showing how hard supermarkets had to work over the festive period, Tesco said it had cut prices, delivered the best operational performance in 6 years and seen the biggest ever day of UK food sales in its history, just to secure a small rise in organic growth. British shoppers turned particularly cautious in 2019 as wage growth slowed and political uncertainty gripped the country. Tesco said a resounding election victory for Boris Johnson in December, which broke the deadlock, had not released any pent up demand. “In a subdued UK market we performed well, delivering our 5th consecutive Christmas of growth”, Chief Executive Dave Lewis said. Tesco, which has a 27.4% share of Britain’s grocery market, also updated on trading in the third quarter period before Christmas, when life-for-like sales fell by 0.4%. That showed shoppers had returned to its stores for Christmas.
