Following the schedule, today, Huawei held a new product launch conference online. It released a large number of new products. During the conference, Yu Chengdong also revealed the sales performance of some Huawei smartphones. He said that as of last month, Huawei 5G smartphone shipments have exceeded 10 million units.

Yu Chengdong said that Huawei’s smartphone shipments in 2019 were 240 million units, an increase of 16.8% year-on-year, and ranking second in the world. At the same time, PC shipments were increased by 200%, and wearable devices were increased by 170%.

Yu Chengdong also pointed out that Huawei’s consumer business ranks second in the world, and the wireless wearable and PC markets have grown by more than 200%. Investment in research and development has exceeded 50 billion yuan ($7.11 billion), ranking ninth in the world.

Moreover, the Huawei executive re-introduced the 1 + 8 + N strategy. “1” stands for smartphone, “8” refers devices such as PC, tablet, TV, audio, glasses, watches, car, and headset while “N” talks about the number of sections. These are all manufactured by Huawei, while N is a product of the HiLink platform, from Huawei’s partners.

Last week, Counterpoint Research reported that nearly half of the total global 5G smartphone sales last year came from China. And Huawei (including its sub-brand Honor) dominated 5G smartphone sales in the country.

The report found that Huawei and Honor are the only two mainstream companies in the Chinese market to achieve smartphone shipment growth in 2019. Apple and Xiaomi have each experienced a significant decline of more than 20%.
