SHANGHAI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - China’s benchmark index closed at its highest level in more than eight months on Tuesday, resuming a rally prompted by hopes of a brighter trade outlook and more policy support, as worries over Middle East tensions eased.

** The Shanghai Composite index ended 0.69% higher at 3,104.80, its highest close since April 25, 2019. ** The country’s blue-chip CSI300 index gained 0.75% to its highest close since Feb. 5, 2018. ** Its financial sector sub-index added 0.61%, the consumer staples sector rose 2.15%, the real estate index gained 0.85% and the healthcare sub-index jumped 1.4%. ** Investors drew relief as there was no immediate escalation in tensions between Washington and Tehran. ** Energy shares underperformed after a rally on Monday as oil prices slid after analysts tempered expectations of a widespread conflict in the Middle East.
