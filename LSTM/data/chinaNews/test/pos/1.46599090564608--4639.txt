Last year, Xiaomi launched its MIUI 11 custom user interface and now the Chinese brand has confirmed that the next-generation custom UI MIUI 12 is officially on its way. This is in line with the company’s pattern of unveiling the new version of its user interface in the beginning of the year.

Right now, apart from confirming MIUI 12, the company has not yet revealed anything related to the upcoming interface. Since Xiaomi has just confirmed this, it is too early to say what it could bring to the plate. However, we expect to get more information about this in the coming weeks.

MIUI has been one of the major offerings from Xiaomi, which was first released in 2010. Since then, the company has been continuously updating this custom operating system and it’s been around 444 weeks.

The upcoming MIUI 12, which will mark the 10th anniversary of the Xiaomi’s user interface, is expected to bring a refreshed interface along with some impressive features. It will be interesting to see what the company has planned to mark this milestone.

It was recently reported that with the MIUI 12, the company will introduce support for a global system-wide dark mode. This came from one of the developers of the company working on this upcoming product.

At a time when the company is releasing MIUI 11 stable to most Xiaomi and Redmi devices, it has started working on the new features for MIUI 12. Back in October, the company’s executive, Xu Jieyun, General Manager of Public Relations confirmed that Xiaomi has already started working on the new MIUI 12 OS.

The recently launched MIUI 11 is a big update for Xiaomi that changes up a lot of things for the popular custom operating system. Starting with the visual aspects, you get slightly softer icons, a system-wide dark mode, new Mi Lan Pro system font and improved always-on display functionality. There are also new animations, themes, wallpapers and improved notification system.

It also focuses on enhancing the audio experience with all-new dynamic natural sound effects and alarms. Xiaomi also announced the new Mi Go Travel suite which will help you with booking tickets for a broad range of transport ranging from airplane to rail and bus alongside currency conversion and an extreme power-saving mode.
