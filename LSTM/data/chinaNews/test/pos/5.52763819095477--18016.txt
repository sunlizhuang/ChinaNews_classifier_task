SYDNEY, Jan. 22 (People's Daily Online)—From Jan. 18 to Feb. 2, a two-week Karaoke Climb with a Chinese New Year theme is welcoming Mandarin-speaking visitors to climb to the top of Harbour Bridge to sing in the Year of the Rat.

Climbers can find themselves standing at 134 meters above sea level, nestled in the heart of Sydney Harbour, to enjoy the panorama of Sydney city and its surroundings. While at the top, climbers can take center stage and enjoy an unforgettable karaoke experience surrounded by a spectacular view.

BridgeClimb Public Relations Manager, Jessica White, said this year that BridgeClimb tailored lanterns, special red handkerchiefs, tickets wrapped in red envelopes and “Happy New Year” decorations on the left side of photos of Chinese climbers to mark Chinese New Year.

BridgeClimb Sales Manager, Elizabeth Li, said BridgeClimb is an activity for any age, from 8-year-old children to elderly people in their eighties, and that as long as they are generally fit and healthy, they are welcome to climb. 87-year-old Lloyd Poulton, the most frequent ascender, has climbed 115 times.
