Yelper Caroline C., who reviewed Aloha Specialties on Jan. 21, wrote, "I settled for the Aloha bento. It comes with teriyaki steak, Korean chicken, mahi mahi and redondo hot dog, served with a mountain of rice. The steak is tender and the sauce isn't overwhelming. ... The mahi mahi is different from anything I have ever tried. ... The sauce makes it."

Yelper jeffrey l. wrote, "My go-to is the mixed plate. It comes with spam musubi (2), teriyaki beef, teriyaki chicken and macaroni salad. This time I got a side of kimchi. The kimchi was slightly sour with a hint of spice. It was perfect. "
