PIGEON — While exchange students have become commonplace in schools across the country, Laker Elementary School decided to take it a step further this year by having exchange teachers from China.

Two teachers from the Northeastern Chinese city of Changchun are visiting Laker Elementary School for three weeks to observe how Laker Elementary School teachers teach their students and to give some lessons about Chinese culture.

Illinois-based Attitudinal Dynamics International, whose president, Robert Libka, is a graduate of Laker Schools, manages the exchange program.

Laker Elementary Principal Jill VerBurg also visited China a year and a half ago, which made her interested in a possible exchange program.

“ADI reached out to us saying they had two teachers coming from Changchun and asked if we were interested,” VerBurg said. “We jumped at it.”

Two of the Laker teachers, Shannon Popham and Tracy Gordon, are acting as host teachers, where the Chinese teachers can observe how they teach and give their own lessons.

The Chinese teachers are given the Americanized named of Ms. Alice and Ms. Louise so the students can more easily identify them.

Ms. Alice, whose real name is Lyu Chuanjing, observes Popham’s first-grade class and does lessons about Mandarin Chinese words, while Ms. Louise observes Gordan’s second-grade class and teaches how to make traditional Chinese paper lanterns.

While in the Thumb, the Chinese teachers are staying with Elkton resident Sherry Helmuth, who VerBurg said has spent time in China herself due to her husband’s work.

Lyu, herself an English teacher, said that back in Changchun, a city of 7 million people, her second grade class has between 45 and 50 students, while Laker Elementary School has about 20 students per class.

Her main goal in coming to America is to learn about Laker Schools’ curriculum and about the local culture.

“What we know before just comes from a book, the opinion of the author,” Lyu said. “When we come here, we use our eyes to see for ourselves.”

Outside of the classroom, the teachers will visit the Pigeon Historical Center, the Tower Automotive factory in Elkton, and L & T Ziel Farms in Pigeon.

VerBurg hopes that in the future, Laker teachers and administrators can travel abroad to China as well as other locations.

“We hope to keep it going,” VerBurg said. “We’re trying to show these teachers the different aspects of the Thumb.”
