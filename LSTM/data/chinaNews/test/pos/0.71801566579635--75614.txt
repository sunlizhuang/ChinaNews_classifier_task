At this point of time, the Indian handset market is doing extremely well as the sector saw double digit growth reaching a record 49 million units in Q3 2019. This market is growing in leaps and bounds for all its segments, primarily for below 20k price range segment. For a market above Rs 20,000 price range, there are a handful of players who are dominating the market. If I talk about itel in less than Rs 5,000 market, we see that the brand is growing rapidly. As per the last GFK report, the market size for less than Rs 5,000 was limited with almost around 5.5 million devices but in the forthcoming year, we expect that market size will register multi-fold growth.itel has a lot to offer in the price range of Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000 in the smartphone segment. itel is currently the number one player in less than Rs 5,000 price segment in offline channels. Here, we see a lot of opportunities because our target markets, which are tier 3-6 cities are majorly driving India’s growth. Today, In India, more than 60%-65% of the population resides in T3 cities and below towns and are below the age of 30. This section of population has high aspirations. The mid-range and premium smartphones market is flooded with options. Consumers can choose between a myriad of feature-packed handsets from premium brands.It is not the same for the ultra-low budget price category, which usually falls under Rs. 5,000. Here, the options are very limited and mostly falls short of expectations. itel is trying to fill this gap by providing consumers with decent smartphones that suit the aspirations and pocket of the mass segment. Since we have already cemented our positioning in under Rs 5,000 offerings, now with our upcoming products we'll be targeting segment under Rs 5,500 with technologically advanced and premium feature based devices.At one point of time, we thought 2G feature phones will be over in India whereas today out of 1.2 billion total wireless telecommunication subscribers, more than 600-650 million are 4G users and 50/60 million are 3G users, and 500 million users are still using 2G services. Though the industry has started talking about the shift to 5G, in India, more than 50% of the base is still sitting at 2G.Undoubtedly, the idea is to move to 4G but for that, the subscriber base must be 4G. India’s growth will be driven with the transition to 4G phones because a 2G phone has its limitations. While we eventually want to get into 4G, currently there is a huge 2G opportunity as well. With itel smartphone, we want to encash the 4G requirements with the product offering that is less than 5K eventually, dominating it with a more than 50% share. Currently, we are the number 1 player in the offline channels under 5k and we see huge opportunities coming our way.In less than Rs 5,000 market for itel, we have some limitations with marketing initiatives considering the difficult terrain, linguistic and cultural variation in the Indian geography. In order to overcome these challenges, itel has crafted a differential marketing strategy that varied from region to region, depending on consumer requirements, language and sensibilities with the right balance of conventional and unconventional marketing initiatives to ensure brand connect and awareness.In addition to this, we are doing a lot with sales activity, on-ground visibility, wall paintings and other associations such as the partnership with the UP Yoddha Team in Pro-Kabaddi League. We have also done a lot of OOH activities across different markets. Other than that, we are also focusing on 360-degree marketing campaigns, digital campaigns, and radio outreach. We are deeply connected with our consumers with these local initiatives.Challenge has always been there but here the Transsion global strength is really helping us. If you see itel globally, we are the number one player. Transsion Holding is among the top 5 OEMs in China. Backed with thorough research and of course considering scale of business, itel brings some best of the product offering equipped with latest and trendy features under less than 5K price point, which is difficult to bring in the market.Africa is our biggest market. Over-all in Transsion, we have a multi-brand strategy with sub brands: itel, Tecno, Infinix and Oraimo. In markets like Nigeria and Cote d'Ivoire, we have more than 70% market share. But Transsion always works on emerging markets. Transsion is one of the top original equipment manufacturers in China but we don't sell it in China. Transsion is focused towards emerging markets. Other than Africa, Latin America, we are there in Mexico, South-East Asia, Middle-East, Russia etc, we are a global player.As far as India is concerned, it is going to be one of the biggest markets. In India, Transsion is not only doing sales in India, but it is also expanding its capability in terms of manufacturing in India. The Make in India initiative by the government will take us ahead into the path of achieving Digital India mission. Transsion plans not only to manufacture in India for the Indian customers, but it also plans to export from India.Currently, we have an area 2.5 lakh square feet for manufacturing. In the coming time, we are looking forward to a huge expansion of the facility to cater to the demand from the market.Today, 2 SMT lines, 11 packaging lines, more than 2600 people working in the unit. By 2020 H1, we would like to build this further.Production scale is almost 15 lakh feature phones and around 6.5 lakh smartphones. But maybe during the Q1 2020, these 15 lakhs should be more than 20 lakhs and these 6.5 lakhs should be more than 10-15 lakhs. We are not only serving India, but we also cater to the demands of the Nepal market.We are getting a lot of support from the Government of India. The good part is that the MeiTY conducts industry meetings every alternate month. The government of India closely works with all the OEMs, supports us and keeps a regular check form managing the challenges. The government is consistently helping us with various initiatives like recently Minister of Finance announced that anybody who sets up his manufacturing facility after 2019 and before 2023 will have a 15% customs benefit. 25% Corporate tax is another initiative. Some minor challenges are there such as 2% reduction in exports while other things are completely fine.We will be wanting to further invest and increase our expansion in manufacturing. Manufacturing will be one of the core areas.We have two company-owned or company-operated Carlcare service centres, one in Mumbai and one in Noida. The rest is third-party centres but the entire quality and hygiene everything is controlled by our team. We have a picked service team, though third-party, because everywhere it's difficult to have your own service centers. We on a monthly basis check about our customer satisfaction. The customer satisfaction is more than 96-97% because we do independent third-party service. It is not that a random survey, we talk to each customer who visits our service center, on their experience, what is the turnaround time, when did he/she get their handset.For itel, we have a 100-day replacement. Things are going right but yes; it is a super aggressive industry where selling is difficult but getting the bottom-line as well as the top line together is aggressive. Since we are a global company with footprints in more than 60 countries. India is among the top priority markets for us.Transsion has more than 3400 channel partners. In itel, for feature phones, we have more than 1,00,000 retailers.Currently, the average is 35:65 (online: offline). During the festival period, it becomes high with online becoming 45%. But this is not the actual case, because many retailers in tier 4,5,6 markets are purchasing online but sell offline. There are customers who are still not confident to use the wallet, make the payment and later get the product. They ask the retailer to pay for them online and then they buy from the retailer.For 5G, we are working closely in the Chinese ecosystem but if you observe 5G is still in the nascent stage in china too. In India, some brands may bring some 5G compatible models H2 2020, but most of these models will be majorly above Rs 20,000 price category.
