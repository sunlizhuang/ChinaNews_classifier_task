The musician and multimedia artist, whose new show will open at the Hirshhorn Museum this spring, has long been haunted by a particular image: “As the wind passes through windows and slips under doors we meet the characters in the book. If any Times readers know which Balzac book this wind is in — please let me know.”

What books are on your nightstand?

I read as a survival strategy. I wake up every morning full of dread and disbelief. Then I start reading. Sometimes poems, sometimes history or books about dreams or consciousness. Once in a while I look at a few pages of “Sapiens,” by Yuval Noah Harari, or review “The Uninhabitable Earth,” by David Wallace-Wells. I read until I feel better. I’m an optimistic person from then on.

What’s the last great book you read?

“Rebel in the Soul: An Ancient Egyptian Dialogue Between a Man and His Destiny,” translated by Bika Reed from fragments of hieroglyphics between Old and Middle Kingdom Egypt (2500-1991 B.C.). And “Album for Kamila Stosslova,” by the composer Leos Janacek, which includes transcriptions of conversations overheard in trams and on the street with pitch and rhythm notations that Janacek used to compose music.

Are there any classic novels that you only recently read for the first time?

I read “A Woman of Thirty” while looking for a Balzac book that begins with an image that has haunted me for a long time. It’s a book that begins with a wind that blows through town. As the wind passes through windows and slips under doors we meet the characters in the book. If any Times readers know which Balzac book this wind is in — please let me know.
