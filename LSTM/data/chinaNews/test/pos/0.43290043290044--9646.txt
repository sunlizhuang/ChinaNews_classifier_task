It is the development and progress of the mainland that fundamentally determines the direction of cross-Strait relations.

BEIJING, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- Facing the complex and grim situation across the Taiwan Strait, the Chinese mainland has enough confidence and capability to overcome risks and challenges, a mainland spokesperson said Wednesday.

It is the development and progress of the mainland that fundamentally determines the direction of cross-Strait relations, Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman with the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said at a regular press conference in Beijing.

"We will uphold the basic principles of 'peaceful reunification' and 'one country, two systems' as well as the one-China principle, resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and resolutely oppose separatist attempts and acts for 'Taiwan independence' in any form," Ma said.

The mainland will continue to resolutely promote the interests and well-being of compatriots on both sides and the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, and advance the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland, according to Ma. â–
