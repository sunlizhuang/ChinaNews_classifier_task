London: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo vowed never to send intelligence through a network America couldn't trust, declaring China the central threat of our time.

Pompeo was speaking at the Westminster think-tank Policy Exchange alongside his UK counterpart Dominic Raab when he was asked if the US would make good on its threat to limit Five Eyes intelligence from the UK if it allowed China's Huawei to build its 5G network.

"All the elements of the Five Eyes will work together to ensure that the systems are sufficiently secure ... that we have only a level of risk that we find tolerable inside of our systems and we will ensure that we will protect American information through that stance," Pompeo said.

But when asked directly, Pompeo did not rule out denying Britain access to intelligence.
