With the final entry date for 2020’s LVMH Prize applications drawing ever closer, LVMH has announced a new slate of experts joining its expansive roster of judges. Drawing from talent within and outside of the industry, LVMH is welcoming big names and insiders alike.

The most recognizable new name is Gigi Hadid, a celebrity in her own right. The model and philanthropist is joined by Irish activist and influencer Sinéad Burke, House + Holme creative director Ronnie Cooke Newhouse, entrepreneur Caroline Daur, How to Spend It editor in chief Jo Ellison, Shanghai-based stylist, reporter and consultant Leaf Greener, i-D stylist and fashion editor Ibrahim Kamara, MATCHESFASHION.COM buying director Natalie Kingham and Moda Operandi co-founder Lauren Santo Domingo.

Accompanying the new recruits are the LVMH Prize’s staple lineup of experts, which include nearly 60 fashion heavyweights like Naomi Campbell, Tim Blanks, Carine Roitfeld and Suzy Menkes. The experts are abetted by the LVMH Prize Jury, who will select winning designers from the pool assembled by the Expert Panel. 2020’s Jury members have yet to be revealed, but last year’s all-star assemblage included Delphine Arnault, J.W Anderson, Kris Van Assche and Maria Grazia Chiuri.

Emerging designers can enter on the LVMH Prize’s website until February 2.

Most recently, LVMH announced record-high financials from 2019.
