Growing concerns over the impact of building materials on the environment have increased the adoption of sustainable construction practices across the world. Developed markets such as the US and Western Europe have adopted various regulations to promote the construction of eco-friendly buildings. This is also compelling consumers to opt for natural stone products such as marble and granite, instead of plastic composites and other emission-prone products. Furthermore, sustainable construction practices are also gaining traction in other emerging markets such as China and India. These factors are crucial in driving the demand for dimension stone products during the forecast period.
