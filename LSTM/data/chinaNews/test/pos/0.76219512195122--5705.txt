Amalyn Otero was at work looking forward to spending New Year’s Eve with her husband and their two teenage sons and eating Chinese food.

At 7 a.m., she received a call from her husband telling her he had to be at work. He’d been on holiday leave.

“It’s happened before,” Otero said of her husband calling to tell her he had to go in for work. “But then he came home at 1 o’clock that afternoon saying, ‘I got to pack. Things are happening, and we’re deploying.’ I said, ‘Now?’ and he said he was on alert.”

Otero said her husband packed his stuff, and she didn’t see him on New Year’s Eve.

The next three days were “a back and forth,” until Department of Defense officials announced Jan. 3 that the remainder of her husband’s brigade — the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division — would deploy to the Middle East.

The announcement followed the Department of Defense confirming Jan. 2 that the U.S. military killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force.

Once she knew her husband would deploy, Otero told their 18-year-old and 19-year-old sons.

Jan. 3 was the last time she saw her husband.

“When you watch the news, of course you know that things are getting crazy over there,” Otero said. “You know that’s where he’s going, but it’s not knowing exactly where. … It’s crazy to hear so many things going on there and not know where my husband is and then hear about missiles the other night and wonder if he was there or close.”

Pentagon officials said more than a dozen ballistic missiles were launched Tuesday by Iran against U.S. and coalition forces at the al Assad and Erbil military bases in Iraq.

It’s her husband’s fifth deployment, but Otero said she still has the natural questions that she doesn’t know all the answers to.

“This was such a quick deployment of him leaving and going so fast and not knowing if he’s going to be there for three months, six months, or a year,” she said.

While she waits, Otero said she is finding solace from the 82nd Airborne Division’s command team keeping families updated on information they are able to release.

“We’re getting updates from the division, which they're really good at reaching out to the spouses,” Otero said. “I can’t complain. They’re really good at easing your mind when you turn on the TV and see something’s just happened.”

For Otero, who also has family affected by the past week’s earthquakes in Puerto Rico, she’s trying to keep her mind focused on work, her sons or staying connected to other military spouses.

“It’s probably good that my mind is occupied eight to 10 hours a day,” said Otero, who is a full-time nurse at a pain management facility. “Also when I clock out, I’m an Army spouse, so I’m making sure I go to whatever briefing that I can be involved in. And it’s good my kids are adults, because I can dedicate my time to help out spouses that are also having a hard time dealing with this situation.”

And Otero said the division commander’s wife and command sergeant major’s wife reach out to spouses, too.

“They don’t forget about you,” Otero said. “Everyone kind of unites. There’s some younger spouses who have never been through this before, and it’s very reassuring that we get to talk to each other, and that homes are open. … I can honestly say being a part of this division, they’re amazing. … You just feel at ease you feel like, ‘Wow, they’re genuine.’ and it’s a really good feeling, ’cause then you don’t feel alone.”
