Kolkata: Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal called on domestic industry to be more self-reliant and imbibe the spirit of nationalism in realising the country’s goal to become a $5 trillion economy. "Industry must work with a spirit of nationalism and oneness to increase self-reliance," Goyal said at the ET Bengal Corporate Awards in Kolkata on Thursday.Industry big guns in attendance included ITC chairman Sanjiv Puri Bandhan Bank founder and MD Chandra Shekhar Ghosh, Ambuja-Neotia group chairman Harshavardhan Neotia , Keventer Agro CMD Mayank Jalan and Patton Group MD Sanjay Budhia. Alluding to the deadly Covid-19 viral outbreak in China, Goyal said the world was in the throes of a 'medical challenge' which had heightened the uncertainties in the global business environment, a scenario that called for greater self-reliance for local industry.The minister encouraged industry captains present at ET's marquee business event to do what it takes to protect local businesses. There are countries that don’t allow Indian steel to enter their shores, not by virtue of any government diktat, but simply since local industry and stakeholders in those countries want it that way, Goyal said.The minister lamented that whenever the government coaxes industry to build world-class quality standards locally, it faces maximum resistance from local business and stakeholders. He called on industry to rethink and reconsider (their) business models: to create a value chain that supports domestic industry the way it happened in other parts of the world. He voiced optimism about India becoming a $5 trillion economy if all stakeholders work as a team. "Together we can move mountains to realise the $5 trillion economic dream," said Goyal. He urged industry to leverage the 'Vivad se Vishwas'' scheme to achieve closure of pending tax disputes swiftly.
