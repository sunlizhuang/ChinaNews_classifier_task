The opening ceremony took place in Harbin Ice and Snow World and involved colourful celebrations complete with festive fireworks to kick off the event in China’s northeast Heilongjiang province.

The festival itself is one of the largest ice and snow festivals in the world, with approximately 220,000 cubic metres of ice and snow used to build the mystical ice world, Xinhua News Agency reports.



It has been a significant driver in creating a name for Harbin as a popular winter tourism destination.
