CANTON Spencer Bentley is keeping pace with his older brother, Caleb Bentley.

Spencer Bentley, 17, is among 143 members of the Buckeye Council Boy Scouts of America to earn the Eagle Scout award. He was joined Sunday at the annual Eagle Scout Recognition Event in the Historic Canton Masonic Temple by his 20-year-old brother, who had earned the Eagle Scout honor earlier.

"I redid the pool at Camp CHOF (Christian Hall of Fame)," said Bentley, a Perry High School junior, describing his service project. "We redid the flooring, the cabinets, painted the walls, built a shed."

Bentley is with Troop 912, which is sponsored by Reedurban Presbyterian Church in Perry Township. The Boy Scouts earned their Eagle Scout honors in 2019.

"After I earned my Eagle, I was able to be vice president of Ohio HOSA (Health Occupations Students of America)," Bentley said. "I want to go on to be a nurse practitioner, acute care."

Joining the new Eagle Scouts was North Canton Mayor Stephan Wilder, an Eagle Scout award winner. Wilder was recognized during the ceremony as a winner of the James A. West and Silver Beaver awards from the Buckeye Council.

Wilder was elected mayor in North Canton in 2019. Also, Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague attended the ceremony.

"You are joining a group of individuals who took leadership not only in commerce and industry, but also in government," said Sprague, who was elected to statewide office in 2018.

The Buckeye Council takes in 12 counties in Ohio and part of a county in West Virginia.

"This is the highest award a youth member can achieve in the Boy Scouts of America," said Jesse Roper II, scout executive of the Buckeye Council. "Most of them started in our Cub Scout program, which is our entry-level program."

Jim Hill, a scoutmaster from Strasburg, had two reasons to feel proud. Sitting at a table with him during the the event were Hillâ€™s two sons, Hugh Hill, 17, and Joseph Hill, 16, both Eagle Scout award winners.

"I am very proud of the accomplishment that they have done," Jim Hill said. "I earned my Eagle Scout in 1982. I have been involved with Boy Scouts since I was 8 years old. The Boy Scouts gives them leadership skills that will carry on in their future lives. Some will stay active in their troops, some will become adult leaders after they turn 18."
