As the sound of the celebrations marking the UK’s departure from the EU die away tonight – historians may look back and say this day exemplified not just the end of Brexit but the start of Britain’s new, all-powerful economic renaissance.

Why? In fact, since 2016 that miracle has already been happening - a true ‘Brexit Boom’. Little noticed by Government, politicians or big business, thousands of small British companies abandoned the EU and began winning lucrative export deals all around the world.

Since 2003 our London-based research agency Gibson Index Ltd (GI) has tracked the UK’s best smaller companies, around 70,000 in total, giving it a telescopic view of the UK’s real economy.

Soon after the EU Referendum result, GI began receiving dozens of news stories, then hundreds, and now thousands, about SMEs signing new export deals in markets outside the EU.

The UK economy is now rapidly switching its strategic trading pattern away from the near-dead EU to new sales in the ‘Big Three’ high growth markets of the world: North America, Middle East and south Asia.
