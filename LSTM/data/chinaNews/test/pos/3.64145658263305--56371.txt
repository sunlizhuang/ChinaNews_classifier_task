CANTON-Mr. John R. Barclay turned 103, Jan. 25. He was born 1917 in Royalton, Illinois, the seventh of 11 children.

At Tuesday night’s Canton City Council meeting, the entire council honored Mr. Barclay with a proclamation.

The suggestion to do so came from Alderwoman, Angie Lingenfelter.

Mayor Kent McDowell emotionally read the proclamation noting prior he had known Mr. Barclay for 30 years, “We’re friends, he’s a heck of a cook and we’ve worked on some campaigns.”

According to the proclamation, Mr. Barclay learned the art of cooking from an early age by helping his mother feed their large family.

In June, 1941 he was drafted into the U.S. Army, 33rd Armored Regiment, a part of the 3rd Armored Division.

Initially, he applied his cooking skills to support with mess operations but was soon shipped to England to prep for the Normandy Invasion.

His regiment surged into France, June 1944.

Mr. Barclay eventually became Staff Sergeant and “didn’t shy away from the call of duty as his regiment ventured into the Battle of Hurtgen Forest, the Battle of the Bulge, and finally celebrated V-J Day in Germany as the world learned of the war’s end.”

Upon returning home, he married his pen pal sweetheart Oct. 23, 1945, Leila Hoyt.

Together, they enjoyed more than 50 years of marriage.

Mr. Barclay subsequently parlayed his cooking skills operating a diner in Lewistown for years.

Later, he cooked for a rooming house in Canton for women attending Spoon River College.

Mr. Barclay enjoys frequent visits from many grand and great-grandchildren.

McDowell concluded the proclamation by saying, “Now, therefore, be it proclaimed that on January 25, and every day of the year, we honor John R. Barclay, who served his country so fully and honorably, and that we remember his memories for future generations.”

Mr. Barclay is still as witty as ever.

McDowell promised him he would be at his next birthday celebration and Mr. Barclay quipped, “I’ll make sure I’m there, too.”
