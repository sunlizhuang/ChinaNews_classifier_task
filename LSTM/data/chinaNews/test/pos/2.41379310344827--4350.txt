The release said all work will be done in consultation with the Chinook Indian Nation, and that the Chinook Indian Nation Tribal Council endorsed the project along with Port District 1, the town of Cathlamet and the Wahkiakum County commissioners.

“This project is unique in the lower Columbia area, bringing together for the first time Wahkiakum County jurisdictions and the Chinook Indian Nation, whose indigenous homeland includes the local environs where Wahkiakum and Kathlamet Chinookan bands occupied the land adjacent to the Columbia river in self-governing villages for thousands of years before the arrival of the Lewis & Clark Corps of Discovery in 1805,” the press release said.
