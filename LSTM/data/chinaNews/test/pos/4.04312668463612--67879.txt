China has expressed appreciation for Pakistan over Senate’s resolution which showed full solidarity and support to Beijing’s battle against coronavirus.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said in Beijing on Tuesday that the resolution expressed its appreciation for China for having treated Pakistani citizens, especially students in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, with protection and comfort. “China and Pakistan are iron-clad friends and all-weather strategic cooperative partners with a tradition of mutual assistance. This resolution stands as further testament to the unwavering friendship between our two countries and peoples. It shows once again that we, as a community with a shared future, can always rely on each other in difficult times,” the spokesperson said. “China stands ready to strengthen cooperation with Pakistan and other members of the international community to combat the epidemic and contribute to global public health. With a highly responsible attitude, we will also enhance communication and coordination with Pakistan and do our best to ensure the health and safety of Pakistani nationals in China.”

The spokesperson said China attaches great importance to the health and safety of all foreign nationals in Wuhan. “We have taken effective measures to timely respond to their concerns and requests. WHO DG Tedros also stressed many times that flying out in a rush is not recommended, the best way being stay put and enhancing self-protection. For those countries that wish to take home their nationals, China will make relevant arrangements and offer necessary assistance consistent with international practices and our domestic epidemic control measures.” To a question that the outbreak will trigger a domino effect on China’s economy, have a major impact on global supply chain and lead to a slowdown in world economic growth, the spokesperson said, “We believe our economic fundamentals that support China’s long-term growth will remain unchanged, and we are capable of minimizing the epidemic’s impact on our economy. In fact, international institutions including the IMF and the World Bank noted that China has enough policy space to deal with the epidemic and China’s efforts have effectively reduced the risks the world economy may be exposed to.”
