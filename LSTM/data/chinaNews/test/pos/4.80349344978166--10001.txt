The form and genre are not limited. The museum carefully prepared for the event.

In order to fully demonstrate the importance and support for this event, before the event began, the museum used the Zigong Dinosaur Museum's official overseas social media account to use pre-order videos, posters, graphics, and other forms to warm up the event. Netizens from all over the world excitedly expressed their expectations and aspirations for this event. Many people expressed their desire to participate in this event because of its novel and creative form.

The "OneStrokeFinishADinosaur" online solicitation started on December 25, 2019, at Christmas. Some fans who have learned about the challenge early on can't wait to use their own accounts to post their work. As one of the best dinosaur museums in the world, the appeal of the Zigong Dinosaur Museum is huge.

During the event, videos combining the works of domestic and foreign netizens were posted on social platforms, further stimulating the participation of netizens.
