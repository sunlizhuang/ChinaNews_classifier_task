China appreciates Laos' efforts to arrange within a short time the Special ASEAN-China Foreign Ministers' Meeting on Coronavirus Disease and the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Foreign Ministers' Meeting, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said.

Wang made the remark during his meeting with Laotian Foreign Minister Saleumxay Kommasith in Vientiane on Thursday.

The fight against the disease is the top priority for the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government, Wang said.

Under the guidance of Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, China is giving full play to the advantage of the socialist system and fighting people's war against the disease, Wang said.

Attendants to Thursday's foreign ministers' meetings expressed their confidence in China's ability to win the fight and extended their support for China, and agreed to cooperate to overcome the challenge, he said.

This shows a good tradition that Laos and the ASEAN would stand together with China at important moments, Wang said.

Speaking of China-Laos relations, Wang said bilateral ties have entered a new era as the two countries are working to build the China-Laos community with a shared future.

China hopes to work with Laos to implement the important consensus reached by the top leaders of the two parties and the two countries, and promote bilateral cooperation in various fields.

Saleumxay said Laos appreciates highly China's efforts to tackle the disease, and will stand firmly with the Chinese people.

Laos values greatly the idea of building the Laos-China community with a shared future, an important consensus reached by the top leaders of the two parties and the two nations, Saleumxay said.

Laos also hopes to expand pragmatic cooperation with China and work for completion of the China-Laos Railway as scheduled, Saleumxay said.
