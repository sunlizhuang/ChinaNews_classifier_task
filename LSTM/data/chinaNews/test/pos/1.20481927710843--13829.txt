Lest you’re not aware, on the second day of Chinese New Year, tradition states that parents should be welcoming their sons-in-law to their houses. But it’s 2020: the only tradition we follow is what’s trending on Instagram, so what better way to celebrate the second day than to visit the office of our President and our Prime Minister (i.e. go to the Istana Open House)?

Reader Bao: Why the heck would I want to visit a government place during Chinese New Year?

Istana to Have Free Open House on CNY Day 2 With Live Rats, Food Trucks & Cai Shen Ye

Lest you’re not aware, Istana is like the White House in the US: other than it housing the Prime Minister’s office, it is also the official residence and office of the President of Singapore.

However, while our President does work from the Istana, no President has lived in the premises after Devan Nair, the third President of Singapore. Our current President used to live in a Yishun HDB before moving to somewhere else—but still not in the Istana.

The building usually holds open houses on five big holidays: Chinese New Year, Deepavali, Hari Raya Puasa, Labour Day and National Day.

And as you can tell from the headline, this year’s open house will be held on 26 January 2020 from 8:30am to 6.00pm.

Istana Open House Events

i’mable Gift Market

For this open house, it’ll feature the i’mable Gift Market for the first time.

Reader Bao: What’s i’mable Gift Market?

Oh, welcome back, Reader Bao, and I’m glad you ask. i’mable Gift Market is SG Enable’s initiative to promote and market artworks and artisanal products by talented persons with disabilities.

Our President first officiated this inaugural event in November 2019 at the Enabling Village. This latest edition of i’mable Gift Market at the open house will feature a myriad of items, including leather products, homeware, jewellery, notebooks and paintings.

Here are some of the items that were sold in last year’s i’mable Gift Market:

Well, if you’ve got some extra ang bao money, or if your red underwear has made you some extra bucks during those ban luck sessions, then here’s the place to spend your money for a cause.

Rumours have it that your chance of winning the Toto Hong Bao Draw will increase by 0.00000001% if you buy something there. Just don’t quote us on this, please.

Rats Infestation

Okay, maybe not a rat infestation, but over at the open house, you’d be able to see real rats, because #YearoftheRat

The Wildlife Reserves of Singapore will be setting up an awareness booth about rats and their rodent relatives.

From there, you can learn more about rats’ excellent sense of smell and their ability to adapt to different environments when you visit this booth. Visitors to the booth will also discover several special species of rodents, take part in a mini-game and create cute rat noses using recycled red packets.

You can even interact with two species of rodents – the Dumbo Rats and Guinea Pigs.

How Instagram-worthy cute are they? Here, we Google for you:

Yeah, I wasn’t aware that rats can be that cute, too.

Other Events in the Open House

Other than taking selfies with rats and spending all your ban luck winnings for a good cause, there would of course still be other interesting events.

There would be buskers at the Lawn (though I’d have to warn you in advance: they’re most likely going to sing those overused CNY songs), traditional Chinese performances such as lion dance, Chinese dance and Chinese drums, and even food trucks selling Thai fusion food and Impossible Burgers and fries.

By the way, Ah Gong Istana also encouraged you to wear red for this event.

Tours of Istana

And just like any open house, there would be a guided tour of the Istana main building where guests can visit selected function rooms and view collections of State Gifts presented to the President and the Prime Minister.

But don’t bet on Obama appearing out of nowhere to kiss babies, though.

Reader Bao: You do know that the President of Singapore isn’t Obama, right?

Of course I know. He finished his term in 2016 mah. There’s another election this year. I think Joe Biden will win.

Reader Bao: Wah, you’re really ignorant. You need to go for the Istana Heritage Gallery which is situated at Istana Park. It’ll be open from 10am to 6pm for that. Go learn something about Singapore, please.

Oh, okay. But anyways, I do know that Hillary Clinton isn’t the President of Singapore.

Lest you’d like to know the event schedule, just take a look at this:

Reader Bao: Wait, Cai Shen Ye is there as well?

Didn’t you read the headline?

Istana Open Hour CNY 2020 Fees
