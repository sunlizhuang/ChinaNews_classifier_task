A Chinese New Year celebration event in Oxford has been cancelled.

The event, which is run by the Chinese Community Advice Centre every year at Oxford Town Hall, has been pulled due to the coronavirus outbreak in China.

Mei Clark, of the Chinese Community Advice Centre, said: "It's a very sad decision, but we cannot risk the health of the general public."

It was to be held on Sunday and would have been the centre's 29th celebration, welcoming the year of the rat.

Participants had been rehearsing months in advance for performances, including music and dance, a community choir, childrenâ€™s choir, a poetry recitation and comedy sketches.
