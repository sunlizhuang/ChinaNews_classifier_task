"Korean families gather together to make mandu, like 200 or 500," Korean chef Inui Cho told ABC News, recalling her fondest memories of celebrating the holiday. "It's like traditional culture of the family."

Cho grew up in Suwon, Korea, and built her culinary career with a deep appreciation for cultural culinary traditions. After attending Le Cordon Bleu in Korea, Cho worked in an array of renowned kitchens for chef Daniel Boulud before becoming the corporate chef for CJ Cheiljedang at their headquarters in Seoul.

Chef Cho's famous Bibigo Mandu, a traditional Korean-style dumpling filled with beef and vegetables, has become the brand's most popular recipe that's used by home cooks and chefs globally and is a staple on Lunar New Year.

"Korean dumpling is a little different than Chinese dumpling," she said. "They use just pork or chicken, but the Korean dumpling is a wholesome one that adds vegetables and the protein, and everything is filled inside a thin wrapper."

Happy Lunar New Year!
