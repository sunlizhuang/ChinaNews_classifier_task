Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel, announced today that it’s taking special precautions to screen the droves of Chinese tourists expected for the Lunar New Year holiday.

Dubai Airports said that, following government guidance, all passengers arriving on direct flights from China will receive thermal screening at the gate upon arrival and be provided with informational brochures.

The screening will be conducted at secured, closed gates by teams from the Dubai Health Authority and the Airport Medical Center, Dubai Airports said in a statement provided to The Associated Press.

Preliminary figures show Dubai Airport welcomed some 3.7 million passengers from China, a 5 percent increase year-on-year.
