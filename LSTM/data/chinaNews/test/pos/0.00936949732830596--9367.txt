Growth in VC investment exceeded 40% for the third year in a row.

The UK is third behind only US and China in terms of VC funding received in 2019.

Companies headquartered in London raised $9.7 billion during 2019.

Eight more unicorns were created in the UK in 2019 – Rapyd, CMR Surgical, Babylon Health, Sumup, Trainline, Acuris, Checkout.com and OVO Energy – taking the total number based in the UK to 77.

London remains the leading city for unicorns in the UK, having produced a total of 46 unicorns since 1990, Manchester, Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Bristol have produced a combined total of 20.

Of the latest unicorns to join the list, OVO Energy adds to Bristol’s tally while Cambridge-based CMR Surgical pushes Oxbridge’s combined total to 11. Two unicorns are based in Leeds: Sky Betting & Gaming and TransUnion UK.

Six UK cities rank amongst the top 26 cities in the world for raising venture capital in 2019, these are London ($9.7bn), Cambridge (12th), Bristol, Oxford, Manchester and Edinburgh.

The amount being invested in early-stage companies increased, reaching $5.1 billion in 2019 up from $4 billion the year before.

2019 saw the number of early-stage investment rounds grow by 20% year-on-year. While among more mature companies, a total of $5.4 billion was invested in rounds exceeding $100 million in 2019 – more than twice the amount invested in such rounds during the same period last year.

Of the highest-value UK rounds, five companies raised more than $250 million each, and three of those exceeded $500 million in a single round.

2019 saw one of the UK’s largest ever Series A investments, made in payments processor Checkout.com ($230 million) in May, and the largest UK round of all time, which saw $800 million being invested in supply-chain fintech Greensill in October just five months after the company had raised $655 million.

The UK’s best performing sectors were fintech, AI and clean energy.

UK fintech firms raised $5.4bn last year, representing a 100% increase from 2018’s total of $2.7 billion, as a result of both the Greensill and Checkout.com investments plus significant fundraises from the likes of World Remit ($197 million), Monzo ($147 million) and Starling Bank ($98 million).

In AI and deep tech, investments in Benevolent AI ($90m), Melody ($60m) and Wayve ($20m) helped push the investment total across these sectors to $3.2 billion – up from $2.6 billion in 2018.

While clean energy is a smaller market, OVO Energy’s $260 million deal, alongside $81 million investments in photovoltaic and solar panel firm Oxford PV and BBOXX, similarly helped push 2019’s total investment in this sector to just short of $1 billion for the first time, which is a 45% increase on 2018’s figures.
