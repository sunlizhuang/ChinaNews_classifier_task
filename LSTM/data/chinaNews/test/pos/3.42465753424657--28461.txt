The second annual Chinese Spring Festival took place Jan. 25 at Sanctuary, marking the official beginning of the Chinese New Year.

Maynard businesses Metrowest Kung Fu and TruNature Salt Therapy collaborated to host the event.

The festival featured the traditional Lion Dance, a fashion show, Chinese music and food, and demonstrations of kung fu and tai chi.

2020 is the Year of the Rat.

According to chinesenewyear.net, the rat is the first zodiac animal. Rats were seen as a sign of wealth and surplus in Chinese culture, and because of their high reproduction rate, married couples prayed to them for children.

Rats are clever, quick thinkers. They are successful, but content to live a quiet and peaceful life.
