On one hand, we continue to attract a lot of liquidity into the system and liquidity comes largely from the foreign investors through the ETF route and that money goes into some of the larger companies where the liquidity can be parked easily and they have the representation on index.The money possibly coming into the system is chasing a few stocks and resulting in index movement and that is what’s behind the market movement. In the last few days, we have seen Bank Nifty remaining under pressure largely because of the telcos’ AGR dues. Since Bank Nifty has remained under pressure, the market has remained on correction mode. In my view, nothing has changed fundamentally as far as the market and the direction is concerned.On the contrary, as we grow, we are getting a bit more clarity on every front in respective companies. Particularly the Q3 result season suggests that the companies have been able to manage their cost structure well, contain the raw material cost well, particularly the metal commodity prices. All in all, fundamentally things remain strong. Maybe we will see follow up buying happening in some of the select stocks going forward. We believe that the market is going to be selective and maybe corrections of this degree will continue during the course of the market.Largely, China is shut as far as the investment programme is concerned and that is possibly bringing liquidity into our markets. Some of the largecap companies where this money is getting attracted are driving the market prices. IPOs which are likely to hit the market, be it SBI Cards IPO or any other IPO that is being talked about. Market would possibly be attracting a good amount of liquidity even through the IPO route. It will be difficult to judge the quantum of funds coming into IPOs because currently, the money is also moving to passive investment products like ETFs and one is not too sure as to how much further flows can come into ETFs. But the direction remains quite strong flow of money coming into the market and that too into select stocks.Metal as a commodity space is possibly in a cyclical upswing and the trend is likely to continue. In Asia pack, the amount of economic growth has been relatively stable compared with other places. India, in particular, is in a capex mode so obviously the amount of consumption of the metal is on the higher side. The metal prices are likely to remain steady. Crude oil prices are soft and with metal prices steady, it should lead to a revival in demand in different pockets in the world, and that is why we believe as a commodity space metal could possibly do much better than it has done in the last three-four years. Next two to three years could possibly see a strong emergence of metals as a commodity. We particularly continue to like the less volatile commodity -- zinc and aluminium. Both have relatively lesser volatility. In the steel commodity, there are few names to choose from but all these companies could possibly show relatively better profit performance given the underlying trend on the metal commodity prices remaining steady to firm going forward.We continue to stay selective with some of the good quality midcap companies where our conviction on the fundamental strength of the company is on a higher side. Some of the auto and auto ancillaries companies are likely to see at least a couple of months of challenges but at the end of it, it should see a demand revival coming in. So auto, auto ancillaries pack is one area we are comfortable looking at. Some of the chemical companies in the midcap space are basically good to go with because of the good amount of demand and the China factor favouring them. They are relatively looking good. The strong conviction stays with the companies which are likely to offer IPOs that include SBI. SBI Cards and for that matter, HDFC for HDB Financials are companies that would remain in our focus for adding into the portfolio during corrective downside.
