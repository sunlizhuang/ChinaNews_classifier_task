The Feb. 8 article in the Cape Breton Post (“I Apologize to Everyone”) shares the story of Ken Zhou and his decision not to accept Chinese students at his restaurant for the immediate future.

The owner of the Fortune Star restaurant on Prince Street in Sydney was fearful that some of the students at Cape Breton University might have travelled back home to China for the holidays.

We have to realize that there is a fear in China that we are far removed from. We only view the situation from the comfort of our living room.

Mr. Zhou and his wife probably have close contact with family and friends in China and they are fully aware of the devastating effect of this virus. Hundreds of people have died and the disease is still spreading.

In making this drastic decision, Mr. Zhou was trying to keep his customers safe.

Due to the backlash, the family is closing the restaurant for a month. They are losing their income and the staff are losing their wages.

Restaurants are hard businesses to run and the profit margin is low, so the family is probably nervous that people will not return when they re-open.

When the Zhou family opens the doors of the Fortune Star Restaurant, let us all walk through those doors or order a delicious take-out meal.

They were looking after our safety with their original decision. Let us support their business when they open in a month.

The Fortune Star Restaurant needs our support and compassion.
