U.S. diplomat sees Russia-U.S. deconfliction channels in Syria as efficient at all levels (Part 2) WASHINGTON. Jan 30 (Interfax) - The United States Department of State sees the channels for deconfliction interaction between Russian and U.S. forces in Syria as extremely efficient at all levels, U.S. Special Representative for Syria Engagement James Jeffrey said. "The deconfliction channels are very effective, and they work at each level," Jeffrey said at a news briefing in reply to a question from Interfax on Thursday. "Obviously, there's a need for deconfliction from time to time," as "there are minor misunderstandings," and this is why this mechanism is essential, he said. "We are very pleased with the deconfliction mechanism so far," Jeffrey said. va rm kl (Our editorial staff can be reached at eng.editors@interfax.ru) /Interfax/ Subscription You can access a demo version of, receive more information about or subscribe to Interfax publications by filling in and returning the form below.
