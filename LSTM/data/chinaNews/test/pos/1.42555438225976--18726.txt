Pix is the first animative backpack in the world. You can display widgets, pictures, animations, and even your digital art on its back surface. Despite being introduced as the first digitalized backpack, Pix is a convenient city backpack. It is resistant to water and bending.

Pix helps to change your look with just a click depending on the situation or feelings. The product is based on everybody’s innate demand to stand out.

CEO Pix Margaret Rimek shared a story of bringing to life her baby-startup and gave valuable insights on how to prepare a campaign on Kickstarter, launch manufacturing in China, cause buzz in foreign media, and register a company in the USA.

Dream Team

Founders of the project are Sergii Yezdin (marketing and sales), Ivan Kaunov (soft and manufacturing), and I, Margaret Rimek (strategy). We met at the National University of «Kyiv-Mohyla Academy» 5 years ago. Before Pix, Sergii and I were working as digital marketing specialists at one of the Ukrainian startups. We had a chance to put different promotion tools and techniques to the test, which successfully use at Pix now. Ivan worked in the IT industry and had his projects in business automatization.

Recently, Ivan left the team, and the new CTO became Andriy Glizhynskii. He lives in China and is responsible for manufacturing.

Our first project, together, a smart pet collar, didn’t enter the market because our competitors went ahead and launched an almost identical product.

It didn’t break us because, first of all, we are friends. We ride bikes, go camping together. Friendship is a fundamental thing for us, and satisfaction from the results we from working together is just a new level of our friendship.

At this point in time, 9 people work at the company, and half of the team doesn’t work at the office. We use a project management approach: meet one time per week, write down clear sprints, and then check who did what.

The First Prototype and First Investments

The first backpack prototype was built manually and presented at DIY Lab. We didn’t know anything about electronics, so we found the engineers who agreed to help us with the project. As young developers, we were granted $1,000 by DIY Lab to create the prototype of the backpack.

Our first prototype looked like a baggy checkered backpack, which we bought for 20 UAH at the local market. We cut out a hole in the fabric and glue this pixelated plastic screen right there. Pixels were uneven and constantly falling down. The product had over 15 prototypes.

In March 2018, Volodymyr Ilchenko joined our team as a new Product Designer and created a new design of the product from scratch. Finally, we decided to sew the screen inside the backpack.

Before the development of the ultimate product’s design, we had main jobs and worked on Pix part-time. Over a year, we invested in the project our own $10,000, which we spent on prototypes creation, tailors salaries, and design.

In spring 2018, Pix got its first investor, Roman Kravchenko (ed. — Ukrainian investor, founder of IoT Hub). Evaluating Pix, we took into consideration the idea’s potential and level of implementation, the team, and the experience of other startups in initial stages. Getting the first investments was the most challenging step on our way.

Finding the Target Audience

We were identifying the target audience of the product for a long time. One time we squander $1,500 on design, logo, and corporate identity, which then threw. We identified our target audience in the wrong way because we decided that Pix would be interesting for children. It was very painful because we only started our startup journey.

“WOW” effect is the main emotion that Pix caused. Huge crowds were gathering near our booths. Both adults and children asked how the product works and asked to test it.

Over the first year, we visited 6–7 exhibitions in Ukraine. We collected feedback and constantly observed people who were interested in the product most and said: «I’ll pay. It doesn’t matter that it is the prototype».

A lot of insights were born from conversations with other people and observations over their emotions. We assumed that our client was an ambitious young guy of 25 years old. He likes gadgets and innovations. He isn’t afraid of standing out in the crowd. We launched the campaign on Kickstarter targeting this audience. The statistics confirmed that we didn’t make a mistake. Pix pledged on Kickstarter over $150,000. Backers received roughly 1,000 backpacks.

As we expected, the USA became the most profitable market for us. The number of orders from Japan and China became a pleasant surprise. Asians like bright things very much, especially if it is a backpack, on which you can display an illuminative pony. When we wore Pix in China, the Chinese chased us, discussing the backpack with delight and pointing fingers at it.

In January, Pix visited CES (Las-Vegas), the biggest exposition of consumer electronics in the world. We were looking for partners for the realization of the first batch of goods there.

Such expositions are reasonable to visit if you have what to sell. You can go there without a product, but in most cases, it will be a waste of money. A little number of people are ready to wait for half of a year unless you produced something. The majority of distributors want to buy goods and start running a business on the spot.

Successful Launch on Kickstarter and Cooperation with Foreign Bloggers

At the stage of product launch, we had a roadmap made by huge smears. However, we knew for sure that we would launch a campaign on Kickstarter. Firstly, on Kickstarter, you can raise money on manufacturing without attracting investments and ending up with debts. Secondly, it’s a pretty good tool for idea validation and testing product/market fit. It’s much safer than getting $50–100,000 in a bank, producing a batch of goods, and only then talking about the product.

Having understood that Pix is interesting for people, we quickly created positioning, strategy, launched Indiegogo, manufacturing, retail, online, and offline.

We prepared for launching the campaign on Kickstarter for 2 months. In the first month, we filmed lifestyle and product video. Pitcher video — a production company, which shot videos for Petcube and MacPaw — helped with that. The video on Kickstarter has a crucial role; it should be product-oriented, and with the full revealing of the idea. In the second month, we were engaged in branding of the page, copyright, legal issues, looking for an agency, pre-launching, and advertising.

Before and after the Kickstarter campaign launch, we actively worked with international bloggers and media. 50–60 illuminative backpacks were sent around the world. Half of them went to media and bloggers, and the rest were delivered to testers and Instagram-influencers. We hired a PR agency, but we remained unsatisfied with its work, so we concluded that it is possible to achieve better results by ourselves.

YouTube reviews became the most effective promotion tool for Pix. We didn’t pay any YouTuber. The interest in the product has worked.

Unbox Therapy (edit. — YouTube channel about gadgets reviews with more than 13 bln of subscribers) gave Pix $40,000 per day. Lewis Hilsenteger, the host of the channel, doesn’t take money, but he always reviews products honestly at the same time. When he released a video, we feared to put the button «play» because we thought that he criticized everything severely. But in general, everything was positive.

Unbox Therapy caused a wave of interest. Bloggers from the United Arab Emirates, Brasil started writing to us by themselves.

The best way is to remind the media about you 2 weeks before the Kickstarter launch. You need to set an embargo date to make publications release not earlier than the date of the campaign launch. It’s cool if you managed to create a buzz on the day of the campaign launch. It will help you to attract first backers. We got the necessary sum of $35,000 within two days and a half, however, the most successful projects are supposed to get funding during the first day.

We copied the Kickstarter campaign on Indiegogo and liked this platform more. Unlike American Kickstarter, Indiegogo is less popular and oriented on Europe and Asia, but it gives more convenient tools for pre-orders processing.

Manufacturing in China

We launched the mass manufacturing of Pix in China. From the experience of other projects, we understood that it would cost us half of the Ukrainian price.

We wrote hundreds of different factories, looked for the best manufacturing costs, delivery terms and prices. Then we went to China for a month, where we opted for 2 sewing factories from 100. One sewed Pix for a week, other, one and a half months. The choice was obvious.

Besides taking into account the quality of factory work, I considered my own criteria, business correspondence. If your potential partner writes you with mistakes, like left-handed, he might have the same attitude towards work. It’s very important for me how we communicate, how adequately this person reacts, and how easy you can get in touch with this person.

In Ukraine, there are not only higher manufacturing costs but logistical problems as well. Goods can be easily stuck at the border for a month, and you are helpless in this situation. In China, everything works like a system because they have a lot of manufacturers. They constantly ship to other countries. All you need is to get a product certificate and find a logistic agent.

Pix registration in the USA

Pix is registered in Delaware, USA. There are a few reasons for that. Firstly, it is a convenience of international payments. In Ukraine, long delays happen very often; significant amounts of money frequently can’t get admissions. Secondly, it is much easier to attract foreign investments to European or American companies. In the USA, there are venture capital funds and investment culture. Everything is more-or-less transparent. If you are a European investor, you don’t understand at all how to invest in Ukraine and how it will work.

Lessons and Advice

A good way to kickstart is when you know how you will manufacture a product; the perfect way is when your product is already assembled before Kickstarter.

On the one hand, it is better to start running a business with simple projects because they are easily implemented, and you can learn on them. On the other hand, WOW-effect is usually caused by complicated technology.

It is very important for a brand to be honest with its customers and communicate with them all the time. You need to share achievements, as well as problems. Thus, you will become a brand-friend instead of being a company with no familiar location, which communicates with pretentious, arrogant phrases.

In a startup, it is difficult to plan in the long-term perspective. Facing something on your way, you need to correct your vision and choose the way which is the best for you at a particular time. Everything is changing very fast. If you obstinately go somewhere you planned, you might reach a wrong destination.

Why do You Work on Pix?

With Pix, I stopped thinking that I need to work. It’s like developing your own child and trying to make your baby feel well.
