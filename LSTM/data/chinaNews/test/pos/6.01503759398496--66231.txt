Dear Friend of GATA and Gold:

The near-lockdown of China's people and economy to prevent the spread of the coronavirus is bound to affect the nation's gold demand and gold market, Bullion Star researcher Ronan Manly writes today. The epidemic, Manly writes, will put China's gold market data in great question and it may be months before the data can be considered generally reliable again.

Manly's commentary is headlined "China's Gold Market Not Immune to a Wider Downturn" and it's posted at Bullion Star here:

and Bars in the Safest Way

GoldCore's mission statement since 2003 has been to protect and grow the wealth of our clients, and given growing monetary, cyber, and systemic risks, it is increasingly important to take delivery or have legal title and outright ownership of fully segregated coins and bars.

On all investment and pension purchases and gold and/or silver coin and bars transfers (from banks, ETFs, and digital gold providers) worth more than $10,000 stored in GoldCore Secure Storage in Zurich, Switzerland, we are now offering Secure Storage for free for six months and the gift of a silver bullion coin -- a beautiful, legal tender, 1-ounce Silver Eagle.

GoldCore does not report transactions to any authority, and safety, privacy, and confidentiality are paramount when we are entrusted with safekeeping of our clients' precious metals.

Toast to a free gold market

with great GATA-label wine

Wine carrying the label of the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee, cases of which were awarded to three lucky donors in GATA's recent fundraising campaign, are now available for purchase by the case from Fay J Winery LLC in Texarkana, Texas. Each case has 12 bottles and the cost is $240, which includes shipping via Federal Express.

Here's what the bottles look like:

Buyers can compose their case by choosing as many as four varietals from the list here:

GATA will receive a commission on each case of GATA-label wine sold. So if you like wine and buy it anyway, why not buy it in a way that supports our work to achieve free and transparent markets in the monetary metals?

To order a case of GATA-label wine, please e-mail Fay J Winery at bagman1236@aol.com.
