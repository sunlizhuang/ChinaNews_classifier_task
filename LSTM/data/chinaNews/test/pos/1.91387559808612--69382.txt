SEOUL, Feb. 14 (Korea Bizwire) — The 17th coronavirus-infected patient in South Korean, who was discharged Wednesday after successful treatment, sent a letter of thanks to the medical team.

Patient number 17, a 37-year-old man, sent an e-mail to a medical team at Myongji Hospital in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, where he was receiving treatment.

“I arrived at the hospital when I was confirmed, and I was anxious. But the most memorable thing is that Dr. Kim Moon-jung in his protective suit came to meet me in person and accompanied me to the hospital room. He ensured me with the words ‘You will get better with treatment’,’” he said.

He further added that, “I liked the sight of Dr. Kang, who took care of my condition every day and informed me immediately of any news, and of the medical staff who tried to visit my room in person or give me other warm words of encouragement on video phone.”

He thanked each of the 10 nurses in the negative pressure isolation ward.

Patient number 17 returned home on Jan. 24 after attending a conference at a hotel in Singapore.

After hearing that one of the attendees had tested positive for the coronavirus, he was tested and subsequently diagnosed with the coronavirus on Feb. 5, and had been receiving treatment ever since.

Meanwhile, on Thursday, a Chinese patient who was the first confirmed coronavirus case in South Korea sent a letter to a medical team at Incheon Medical Center where she had been receiving treatment.

The woman in her mid-30s wrote in English, “I am writing to express my most sincere gratitude for what you did for me when I suffered this disaster. Thank you for saving my life.”

She added that “As the saying goes in China, ‘the healer has benevolence,’ to me you are more than that. All of you are my heroes and I will never forget this experience. I will learn from you and try my best to help others for the rest of my life.”

She explained in her letter that “I cannot image that without your advanced medical technology and professional attitude, what would have happened to me and my family.”

She also expressed her wish to invite the medical staff of Incheon City Medical Center who treated to her home once the coronavirus outbreak is under control.
