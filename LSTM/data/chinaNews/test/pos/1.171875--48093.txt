This year marks the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II and the 50th year of the founding of the United Nations.

The first event arguably represents mankind’s greatest effort to defeat tyranny and enable the growth of freedom.

Given the UN’s mixed image of a noble but politically controversial organization, however, its anniversary may not inspire many.

It might be easier to win a world war than to solve endemic global issues such as human rights that the UN tries to tackle. But checking the growth of toxic nationalism is best addressed through nonmilitary means.

Around the world, nationalism is now on the rise and globalism generally in retreat.

Nationalist candidates in European parliamentary elections have registered major increases in wins in countries including Hungary, Austria and Switzerland and England’s departure from the European Union symbolizes that country’s equivalent of President Donald Trump’s “America First” strategy.

There’s often a fine line between populism, which has a long history of periodic rises in American political life, and nationalism, which typically is opposed to globalism, immigration and liberalism and favors nativist positions, including isolationism and protectionism.

President Trump’s vision of “America First” is a form of nationalism with populist appeal.

A catchy campaign slogan, “America First” can be a red flag to other countries and can provide both our allies and our enemies with a rallying cry for resisting America’s international policies.

The president’s emotion-driven, often fact-challenged style and his strain of nationalism continue to resonate with his base and have enabled him to effectively refashion the Republican Party in his own image. But they have created a backlash abroad in most countries not ruled by right-wing or autocratic elements.

According to a 2020 survey of 32 countries conducted by the Pew Research Center, “a median of 64% say they do not have confidence in Trump to do the right thing in world affairs, while just 29% express confidence” in him.

Given the president’s dislike of institutions, he probably won’t attempt to mend relations abroad via the United Nations or perhaps even through his own State Department. His main international interests likely will remain doing trade deals and limiting most immigration from the Mexican border.

In the wake of the American drone strike that killed Iranian military commander Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 2, it’s become clearer than ever that the president follows his gut more than advice from his inner circle of military or diplomatic advisers.

While we apparently dodged an escalated conflict with Iran, the drone strike underscored the need for a cohesive, disciplined international strategy to further American interests amid the rise of nationalist impulses.

A smarter approach to a globalist American policy could include:

• Fashioning a 21st century “Marshall Plan” that firmly links our foreign aid to countries that commit to fair elections and adopt anti-corruption standards

• Favoring sanctions over tariffs and military intervention. Our best defense against hostile governments such as Iran, Russia and Korea is through sanctions.

• Reducing our reliance on foreign creditors, most notably China, through legislation capping the federal debt level and allocating a percentage of future revenues to debt reduction.

• Appointing ambassadors with international experience and not favoring major political campaign donors who lack such skills.

• Reestablishing U.S. leadership on climate change, the issue that ultimately affects the entire globe, by setting aggressive domestic targets for carbon emission reduction even more stringent than those contained in the Paris Accord and offering incentives to trade partners that meet the targets.

• Better leveraging and coordinating the relationships our international businesses have with foreign governments to develop industry-specific global initiatives that could create a de facto U.S. version of China’s long-term “Belt and Road” strategy.

• Always emphasizing our historical support of countries that favor democratic ideals and a commitment to human rights.

An effective long-term international affairs strategy requires a blend of both thoughtful analysis and pure opportunism. The president, however, seems almost entirely focused on the latter approach as he “makes it (strategy) up” as he goes along.

Most major nations adopt a more strategic approach that takes into account analysis of historical trends as well as knowledge of changing conditions.

That’s the kind of global strategy America needs now.

Charles Krauthammer, a leading conservative pundit, once said, “If you’re going to master policy, especially world affairs, you’ve got to know history.” To which one could add, “and act prudently.”
