Kylie Jenner took fans on a tour of the Kylie Cosmetics headquarters via her Instagram Story.

Her face is everywhere because, of course it is.

Kylie Jenner gave fans a sneak peek at her makeup company’s home base and it’s no surprise that she’s everywhere all at once – or, at least her face is.

One of the shots showed a wall-length table stacked with magazines, each starring a different member of the Kardashian/Jenner family. Some highlights included: her GQ Mexico cover from 2017, her Playboy cover which was shot by ex-bf Travis Scott, and her on the cover of Elle China from 2018.

But a whole table of her face just wasn't enough. Three huge portraits of her hang over that table just in case you missed it the first few times.

The second shot Kylie shared looked like the waiting area of a posh pink hotel lobby. But the room just wouldn't be complete without another set of three Kylie portraits.

If Kylie ever wanted to start a Kylie Cosmetics-themed hotel, I’d book a room ASAP.
