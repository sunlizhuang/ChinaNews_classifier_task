DID British Labor Party leader Jeremy Corbyn think that this time of resurgent populism was suitable for his brand of socialism to hold sway? If he did, it was a great delusion on his part. At the last year end election in the United Kingdom, Labor did not only lose, it was overwhelmingly rejected by people who used to vote Labor. One reason voters deserted Labor, according to surveys, was that under Mr. Corbyn’s leadership, the party had gone too far left.

Mr. Corbyn is known to be no lover of monarchy but realizing the popularity of the Queen and how people relish a future under King William and Queen Catherine, he has ceased to advocate changing the kingdom to a Republic of Great Britain. But he persisted in nationalizing other industries, running smack against the public’s current sensibilities. The British are quite happy with their National Health Service, which was established by a Labor government, but they, it seems, are in no mood to put the royal seal on other private enterprises.





The Tory leader Boris Johnson emerged victorious because he had a better sense of the public pulse. Before the elections, Mr. Johnson attacked his opponent by labeling him a “socialist” and got voters to reject his party’s manifesto because it was socialistic. Mr. Johnson’s has been one of the faces of the populism that got the majority of the British opting out of the European Union in the referendum. The difference between “socialism” and “populism” can seem merely semantic to some, the two denoting an inclination to listen to the wishes of a good number of people from ordinary and lower walks of life. But as the recent elections in the UK have shown, there is a significant, eventual difference. The difference lies in the degree or proportion the state or private enterprise appears to play a role in the changes advocated. Poor Mr. Corbyn, he did look stunned and abandoned in acknowledging the defeat of his party. It was gentlemanly of Mr Johnson just to ignore him and leave him to his misery.

Populist wave

President Donald Trump was of course overjoyed that he was proved right that his clone would win. He was himself brought to power by a populist wave, consisting of evangelicals, Zionists, white supremacists, rednecks, Ku Klux Klan members, Wall Street brokers,

Conservatives, Republicans and those who think themselves marginalized by globalization. And the Washington D.C. bureaucracy. They form an immovable mass base supporting Mr. Trump through thick and thin. They believe and repeat every lie, every “alternative truth” fabricated by him. They seem to be just waiting to serve him. Even before his invitation to fly to Korea was confirmed, he had this crowd clamoring shamelessly for a Nobel Prize for him.

Trump and his ilk have lost no time targeting the leading aspirants for nomination as the Democratic Party candidate for President in 2020. They have at one time been attacked as a bunch of do-nothing socialists. “Socialist” has turned out to be today’s equivalent of “commie” during the McCarthy era. Former Vice President Joe Biden has staked a claim on the legacy of the Obama administration, particularly its affordable health care program. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has denied being a socialist, calling herself a “capitalist to the bones.” She describes herself as a left-wing capitalist who uses public choice ideas to cleanse the State and the markets of their corruption. Sen. Bernie Sanders admits to being a socialist but a democratic socialist, a socialist of Scandinavian vintage.

Observers have warned that the Democrats by going too far away from the center will be ensuring the reelection of Donald Trump. Aren’t Americans something else? They call too leftist politicians who espouse measures like free education from kindergarten to college and universal health care which have been, gosh, commonplace realities in Europe for a long, long time. And they expect the world to look up to them as an exceptional civilization and breed of people.

But it is mostly in the West today where socialism is a bad word.

Mixed economies

Actually, most countries in the world today have mixed economies. It is hard to find one that is completely capitalistic or socialistic. We have to thank John Maynard Keynes for the idea that when the market does not perform to a level desired, consider intervention by the government. It sounds so like common sense today, but Keynes did have to fight for its acceptance. And perhaps we have to thank Deng Xiaoping for thinking the other way around, that when the State does not perform to a level desired one must consider working with market forces.

And so, voila, we have in China today an economy described apparently by the Chinese themselves in the Internet as a socialist market economy. Jiang Zemin is credited for coining the phrase so that China could learn the lessons from advanced capitalist countries without needing to discuss if the reforms are “socialist” or “capitalist.”

The Chinese communists, however, dutifully contextualize their reforms within the framework of Marxist historical materialism. The prior Maoist emphasis on culture and political agency has been rejected. The emphasis henceforth has been on advancing the material productive forces as the fundamental and necessary prerequisite for building an advanced socialist society. In other words, “Poverty is not socialist. To be rich is glorious!” (Deng Xiaoping)

Liberal socialism

China’s economy today is commonly described by outsiders as state capitalism. Internet sources say this is not correct. Despite the coexistence of private capitalists and entrepreneurs with public and collective enterprises, China is not a capitalist country because the party retains control over the direction of the country, maintaining its course of socialist development. While looking for an economic system compatible with China’s specific conditions, Deng remained committed to the Leninist model of centralized political control and a one-party state.

China’s socialist market economy furthermore finds similarity with James Mead’s model of liberal socialism which involves public ownership of firms with independent management where the state acts as residual claimant to the profits generated by its enterprises, but does not exercise control rights over management and operation of its firms. The benefits of the model derive from the state having a source of income independent of taxation and debt, enabling a reduction of the tax burden on individual incomes and the private sector while promoting greater equality.

With Deng Xiaoping’s reforms, China’s gross domestic product rose from some $150 billion in 1978 to $1.6 trillion in 2014. It is today the No. 1 or No. 2 economic power in the world. In 2003, it launched the Belt and Road Initiative, a global development strategy involving infrastructure development and investments in 152 countries. The rise of China from a developing country to economic superpower status in four decades is certainly awesome. One could only wish it were possible for developing countries to emulate China. However, isn’t the China model specific to the needs of China, as Deng Xiaoping intended? It is hard to contemplate the Chinese one-party model inspiring developing countries. In these parts, everyone seems to want to be Leader and found or run a party geared to his individual ambitions and not the needs of society.
