Three top officials including foreign ministers of Russia and China will be visiting Sri Lanka over the next two days. Chinaâ€™s Foreign Minister Wang Yi will arrive in Colombo today on a brief official visit.



His visit assumes significance in wake of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's statement that he will prefer renegotiation over security aspects of Hambantota port. The Port is leased to a Chinese company for 99 years.



The proposed visit of the Lankan President to China may also come up for discussion during the talks.



Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Alice Wells will also travel to Sri Lanka from today- before her visit to India and Pakistan. U.S. state department said the official will meet with senior government officials and members of civil society to discuss a range of bilateral and regional issues. This will include shared interests in a free and open Indo-Pacific region.

Minister of Foreign affairs of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov will pay a working visit to Sri Lanka tomorrow, before his visit to India. He plans to discuss prospects for promoting political dialogue, trade cooperation, and will consider expanding the bilateral legal framework.

All visiting dignitaries will have meetings with the Lankan President, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and Minister of Foreign Relations Dinesh Gunawardena.
