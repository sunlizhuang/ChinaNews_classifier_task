Integrated Biometrics is investing in its research and development footprint, global manufacturing capacity, and its management expertise to prepare for a continuation of its rapid growth, according to a company announcement.

Demian Bigelow has been added as the company’s new Vice President of Engineering to drive new product development and oversee further innovation with IB’s patented Light Emitting Sensor (LES) film technology. Bigelow has previously served as a CTO, principle engineer, and in other roles within the biometric industry.

“I’ve watched IB’s product and technology leadership grow for a number of years,” Bigelow comments. “It’s very exciting to join a technology sector leader at such a pivotal time in their history.”

The company has also acquired office space in Phoenix, Arizona with an expanded clean room, which it says will enable a far greater range of thin-film research and manufacturing. Engineering and manufacturing capacity at IB’s U.S. and South Korea facilities was also recently increased, with the new people and space overall tripling its R&D capability and more than doubling its global, year-over-year manufacturing capacity.

Integrated Biometrics reported revenue growth above 50 percent year-over-year in its latest results, and also opened an office in South Africa last year.

“The changes we’ve announced are based on solid forecasts for very strong years in 2020 and beyond. The addition of Demian Bigelow means we will meet those demands with confidence and excellence,” says Stephen Thies, CEO of Integrated Biometrics. “The increase in our manufacturing and research facilities meets our aggressive sales forecasts with the flexibility to respond to unpredictable market interruptions, such as the current health-related situation in China.”
