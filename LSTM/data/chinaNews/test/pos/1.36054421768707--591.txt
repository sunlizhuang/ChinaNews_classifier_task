Currently, Chilean cherries are flooding into China. As the Spring Festival, a traditional Chinese holiday gets closer, the market demand for cherries is rising. "Recently, the market has been under pressure due to the arrival of large volumes, and prices have started to decline. Compared with the same period of last year, this year's prices are falling faster because the quality is uneven and unstable. In comparison, last year's cherries were very good in quality and had a long shelf life. However, as our goal is to supply the market with the best possible products, we only sell selected high-quality cherries,” Mr. Wei Yuyou from Jiaxing Your Home Fruit Import & Export Co., Ltd. analyzed the current situation.





Jiaxing Your Home Fruit Import & Export Co., Ltd. operates in the Jiaxing Wholesale Market. With the rapid development of China's second-tier cities, the market demand for imported fruits is also rising. "As one of the major importers of the Jiaxing Wholesale Market, we have imported large volumes of products from the West since 2019. Consumer demand for cherries is huge. With large volumes reaching China, it still cannot meet the large demand, so demand will not decrease. Currently, the most popular are small sizes, which are more affordable, and the sales volume is large,” Wei said.











In addition to Chile, countries such as Argentina and Australia are also exporting their cherries to China. “Prices of Argentine cherries are cheaper, which will affect pricing to a certain extent, while prices of Australian cherries are higher, which does not pose a threat to us. Our import volume has increased this year compared with the last, with our total import volume at about 140 containers. Among them, about 80 containers were directly imported by us, and 60 were handled by other Chinese importers,” Wei shared. This week, Wei participated in a one-day special event for representatives of Chilean cherry importers in China.









With the approach of the Spring Festival, Jiaxing Yuehao Fruit Co., Ltd. has designed several different packages to better meet the market demand during the Festival. "In China, it is important to have attractive packaging, especially during this festive period, as many people buy fruit as a gift for their family and friends. Therefore, we not only focus on the quality and taste of the fruit, but also on the packaging."

Jiaxing Your Home Fruit Import & Export Co., Ltd. is a large fruit company that handles a variety of fruits such as blueberries, grapes, oranges, and nectarines from Latin America and pineapples from the Philippines and Costa Rica.
