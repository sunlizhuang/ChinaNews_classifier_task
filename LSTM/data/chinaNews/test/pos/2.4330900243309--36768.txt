Communications minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams is concerned that SA relies heavily on software produced by the West or the East and says its time government focuses on home-grown technologies.

Her reasoning is that if US president Donald Trump, for example, was to prevent all US companies from operating in SA, the country could be in trouble.

Ndabeni-Abrahams’s statements on Wednesday were made during a visit to Dalibaso High in Mqanduli, where she was accompanied by social development minister Lindiwe Zulu and justice deputy minister Nkosi Phatekile Holomisa.

A cyber lab, 100 school uniforms and a bursary to one of the school’s leading technology pupils were handed over by Ndabeni-Abrahams.

She said most technology came from the East or West.

In 2019, Trump ordered US businesses to leave China, saying he had the authority to do so.

Ndabeni-Abrahams said: “Can you imagine if Donald Trump woke up tomorrow and said: “I am recalling all the US companies in SA”.

We don’t have our own software, our own technologies.

“Where would we be? What would we use to communicate?”

Together with the department of higher education, her department should create an SA identity for technology so that “our people develop their own applications'', she said.
