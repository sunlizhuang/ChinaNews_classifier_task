Ivanka Trump donned one of her favorite Oscar de la Renta outfits to watch her father, President Donald Trump, sign the historic first stage of a trade deal with China on Wednesday.

The first daughter was dressed to impress in a $2,490 navy peplum top with a white grid pattern and a matching $1,190 skirt when she attended the ceremony held in the East Room of the White House.

The highly-publicized signing marked the third time she has seen modeling the ladylike ensemble, which she first wore to the G20 summit in Buenos Aires in November 2018.

The White House senior adviser also donned the short-sleeve top and pencil skirt three months ago, when she was seen heading to work in October.

On Wednesday morning, she embraced the unseasonably warm weather and carried her navy wool coat over her left arm — possibly to show off her outfit — when she stepped out of the front gate of her Washington, D.C. home.

Ivanka also lugged her black Chanel tote bag, which has become another favorite of hers over the past year.

She has previously paired the outfit with both white and maroon heels, but this time around, she opted for navy patent leather pumps.

Late start: The White House senior adviser was seen leaving her home at 10:30 a.m.

The first daughter's sleek blonde hair was dried poker-straight, and she stuck with her signature makeup look: a smokey brown eye and dusty rose lipstick.

She accessorized her look with pearl earrings, a ring, and a red string bracelet on her left wrist, which she has been wearing off and on for a few years now.

Though she hasn't spoken about the purpose of the bracelet, it does bear a resemblance to the type of red string that Kabbalah practitioners wear to ward off the 'evil eye.'

Ivanka got a late start and left her home at 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, three hours after her husband, Jared Kushner, was out the door.

On the go: Ivanka's husband, fellow White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, was seen leaving their home a little after 7:30 a.m.

Jared, 39, was seen leaving the front gate of their home a little after 7:30 a.m. with a smile on his face and his work bag in his hand.

The White House senior adviser seemed to be taking a style cue from his father-in-law as he paired his signature navy suit with a crimson tie, though the color was darker than the bright red ties worn by the president.

The couple later reunited at the trade deal signing at the White House, where they mingled with other members of the Trump administration.

Jared was seen sharing a laugh with White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow as they made their way into the East Room, with Ivanka following close behind.

The two both appeared to be in good spirits as they took second-row seats next to each other to watch the signing.

The trade agreement is expected to boost exports from U.S. farmers and manufacturers, protect American trade secrets, and lower tensions in a long-running dispute between the world's two biggest economies.

During the ceremony, President Trump said the deal is 'righting the wrongs of the past.' He promoted the agreement as a way of delivering economic justice for American workers, saying that 'we mark a sea change in international trade' with the signing.

The agreement is being described as 'phase one' of a larger negotiation focusing on tensions in the U.S.-China trade relationship. Chinese leader Xi Jinping said in a letter to Trump that the first phase was 'good for China, the U.S. and for the whole world.' The letter was read by Beijing's chief negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He.

But this agreement left unresolved many of the complaints — notably, the way the Chinese government subsidizes its companies — voiced by the Trump administration when it started the trade war by imposing tariffs on Chinese imports in July 2018.

White the deal stops short of many changes the president has sought from China, it leaves in place tariffs on about $360 billion in Chinese imports, leverage the administration hopes will generate future concessions.

The White House ceremony gave Trump a chance to cite progress on a top economic priority on the same day that the House prepared to vote to send articles of impeachment to the Senate for a trial.

He told Republican lawmakers attending the ceremony that he understood if they had to leave early for votes.

'They have a hoax going on over there. Let's take care of it,' Trump said.

The agreement is intended to ease some U.S. economic sanctions on China while Beijing would step up purchases of American farm products and other goods. Trump cited beef, pork, poultry, seafood, rice, and dairy products as examples.

The deal would lower tensions in a trade dispute that has slowed global growth, hurt American manufacturers and weighed on the Chinese economy. Trump said easing trade tensions was critical.

'Keeping these two giant and powerful nations together in harmony is so important for the world,' Trump said. 'The world is watching today.'

His Chinese counterpart noted that 'the world is now at a critical historical crossroads' facing choices of how to promote country-to-country cooperation.

'Cooperation is the only right choice,' said Liu.
