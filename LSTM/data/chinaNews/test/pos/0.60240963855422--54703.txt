“Our ongoing Year of Investment Initiative will be a testimony to the depth of our cooperation and relationship with China. It is a pleasure for Equatorial Guinea to support its partner in times of need,” he added.

Latest updates from the World Health Organization indicates that the coronavirus as of 6am Geneva time on February 5, 2020; had affected 24,363 people in China, and 490 deaths.

“Outside China there are 191 #2019nCoV cases in 24 countries & one death, in the Philippines. Of those, 31 cases are in people with no travel history to China but all are close contacts of a confirmed case or of someone from Wuhan.

“So far, 99% of the #2019nCoV cases are in #China, and 80% of cases in China are from Hubei province. The relatively small number of cases outside China gives us a window of opportunity to prevent this outbreak from becoming a broader global crisis,” he stressed.
