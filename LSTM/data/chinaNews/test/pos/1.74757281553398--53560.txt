At present, the epidemic of novel coronavirus has drawn close attention from all Chinese domestic and abroad. Under the firm leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, all Chinese people stay united and resolved to fight against the epidemic together. We pay tribute to all those who are fighting the epidemic at the front line and extend our best wishes. Gratitude also goes to all friends around the world for your concern about China's fight against the epidemic. Your greetings and encouragements refuel our strength and confidence.

Qingdao, which is doing its best to win the tough battle of epidemic prevention and control, has ensured that its domestic and overseas investment exchanges are being carried out orderly without interruption. A few days ago, the world's largest container ship loaded nearly ten thousand containers of exported commodities in Qingdao port and set sail! The excellent business environment has led to continuous expansion of investment from domestic and overseas enterprises. On the first day of the Chinese New Year, a high-end chip packaging project made a confirmation call to settle in Qingdao; A world-renowned container manufacturer is making plans to expand its factory based on the information provided by Qingdao. Avionics companies in the United States exchanged information of investment environment via email; Japan Asia Investment Co., Ltd., in the letter of holiday greetings, said they have recently confirmed the work plan of China-Japan food cooperation project; A Singapore company and a Qingdao type B bonded warehouse operator have agreed to set up a cross-border e-commerce company. In due course, the Qingdao business delegation will visit Russia to exchange views with the economic departments of 14 states of Russia.

The epidemic is under resolute prevention and control and continued efforts have been made to promote investment!

In this special period, we will continue to maintain close communication and speed up the progress of the cooperation projects that have been discussed or under negotiation through emails, video chat and phone calls. For all new intentions, suggestions and plans on the cooperation with Qingdao, as long as you send us a message illustrating future cooperation direction and your requests, we will discuss it timely and respond with the highest efficiency and sincerity, and then implement it in detail. If face-to-face meeting is really necessary, we are fully prepared to choose proper time and location for meeting under the precondition of ensuring safety.

In the epidemic, what is isolated is the virus, not the good willing for joint development, neither the hope for win-win cooperation. Qingdao, an open, modern, dynamic and fashionable international metropolis, will always open its mind and work with friends domestic and abroad to discuss and seek common development and share its benefits for a better future.

The cold winter will pass and spring will come finally. We are online 24/7 for serving you sincerely!
