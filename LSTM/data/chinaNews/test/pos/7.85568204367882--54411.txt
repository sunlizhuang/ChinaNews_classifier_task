NEW DELHI, Feb. 5, 2020 /CNW/ -- On February 5, the 15th Auto Expo opened in Delhi, India. Centered around a theme of how Great Wall Motor (601633.SS/02333.HK), a world-renowned SUV and pickup manufacturer, is leading the world through intelligence, the carmaker debuted its Haval and Great Wall EV brands at the event, showcasing the company's strong product lineup and leading technologies to Indian consumers. Great Wall's presence at the expo signals the automaker's formal entry into the Indian market.

Haval, a China-based global leader in the SUV segment, not only staged the world debut of its Concept H and the Indian debut of its Vision 2025, but also exhibited four high-end intelligent SUVs - F7, F7x, F5 and H9 â€“ all of which have established a solid reputation in world markets.
