Located in Dam Thuy commune, Trung Khanh district, Ban Gioc lies on the border between Vietnam and China. The three-layer white water cascade with a width of 50m and a height of 35m is truly a wonder of nature.



About 500m from Ban Gioc waterfall is Truc Lam Phat Tich pagoda which is located on Phia Nham mountain. From the pagoda, one can see the whole of Ban Gioc waterfall and the northern border area of Vietnam.



In Non Nuoc Cao Bang, one should visit Ma Phuc pass, one of the most beautiful passes in Cao Bang, and Mat Than (god’s eyes) mountain in Quoc Toan commune, Tra Linh district. Walking on a path weaving around Mat Than mountain, visitors can explore gorgeous Nam Tra lake and Nam Tra waterfall.



Phia Oac-Phia Den national park in Non Nuoc Cao Bang boasts beautiful untouched scenery. It is home to 90 flora and 58 fauna species which are rare, precious and of high values for scientific research, gene conservation and environmental education. The forest on the western side of Cao Bang province is also regarded as a “green lung” which helps regulate the climate in the region. In winter, Phia Oac is covered with frost and ice.



Phia Oac-Phia Den is also home to a special national historical relic- Tran Hung Dao forest. It is where General Vo Nguyen Giap and 34 soldiers established the Vietnam Liberation Army Propaganda Unit, the precursor of the Vietnam People’s Army.

Original indigenous culture

Legend of the Tay has it that Cao Bang was where Thuc Phan defeated the enemy and unified the Lac Viet and Tay Au. He founded the country of Au Lac and became King An Duong Vuong. Cao Bang was thus a political and cultural center during the period of founding the country, even though An Duong Vuong later moved the capital to Co Loa in Dong Anh, Hanoi.

In Cao Bang, there are nine ethnic groups, including the Tay, Nung, and Dao, who have created a unique and vivid cultural picture here.



Non Nuoc Cao Bang has many craft villages, including the Pac Rang forging village and Phia Thap incense village.



The forefather of the forging craft in Pac Rang was believed to be an old man who accidentally passed the area and taught the craft to the Nung An. The Nung An then built a temple dedicated to this man and every Nung An family has an altar at home to worship the forefather of the craft.



In Phia Thap village, the incense making craft has been passed from one generation to another. Phia Thap incense is safe and has a natural scent because all of its materials come from forest plants.



Non Nuoc Cao Bang is also home to dozens of folk ceremonies, including the Quang Uyen firework festival, and the Long Tong festival of the Tay, Nung, Dao and San Chi. At these festivals, visitors can see beautiful traditional costumes of indigenous ethnic groups and try tasty local dishes. Among the specialty foods in Cao Bang are smoked sausage, roasted duck, roasted suckling pig, grilled meat, sour fish hotpot, and sticky rice with caranium.



Visiting Non Nuoc Cao Bang, one will enjoy valuable moments of relaxation in the beautiful natural scenery and the peaceful life of ethnic locals.

“Non Nuoc Cao Bang geopark has geological value, particularly in the Phia Oac mountain area where nearly 100 million years ago, volcanoes erupted, creating volcanic rocks and numerous minerals, including tin, gold, wolfram, fluorite, and uranium.”
