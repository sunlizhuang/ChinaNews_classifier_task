Class is officially in session at the new Nissan regional training center in Decherd, Tennessee, where manufacturing employees are learning skills needed to build engines for future Nissan vehicles. One of its first major projects was readying employees to assemble the ‘heart of the next-generation Frontier’— an all-new, powerful 3.8-liter direct injection V6 engine debuting on the 2020 Nissan Frontier.

Nissan’s investment reinforces its commitment to developing employees skilled in using advanced manufacturing technology. The Nissan Decherd Regional Training Center is a 21,000 square-foot facility located within the existing Nissan powertrain assembly complex. It has 13 training areas with capacity to train nearly 200 employees simultaneously in the areas of powertrain production, engineering and maintenance.

“The programs offered at the Decherd training center proved to be an integral part of bringing the all-new V6 engine to life,” said Brian Sullivan, vice president, powertrain operations, Nissan North America, Inc. “The hardworking team at Decherd Powertrain is thrilled to power the 2020 Frontier for customers.”

2020 Nissan Frontier

The 2020 Nissan Frontier, which marks the last model year of the current generation, will feature best-in-class 310 horsepower1 while also providing improved fuel economy and emissions performance. With a standard 3.8-liter V6 engine and 9-speed automatic transmission, the versatile 2020 Frontier focuses on the needs and demands of truck owners in the U.S.

The 2020 Nissan Frontier will go on sale in spring 2020. Nissan also announced the same powertrain will be used in the all-new next generation Frontier to be assembled in Canton, Mississippi.
