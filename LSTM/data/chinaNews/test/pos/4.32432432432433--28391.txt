The Quinte Chinese Canadian Association has officially welcomed the year of the rat.

On Saturday’s snowy night, members of the Quinte Chinese Canadian Association, QCCA, gathered together inside Centennial Secondary School’s auditorium to celebrate with song, dance, and food.

“It’s a lot like Thanksgiving or Christmas,” explained Shawn Kao, president of the Quinte Chinese Canadian Association. “On New Year’s Eve you’re supposed to eat with your family and have plenty of food.”

Fourteen musical performances by community members delighted the 2020 Chinese New Year Celebration Gala audience as they celebrated the beginning of the Spring Festival.

The Chinese New year celebrations don’t last for only one day. Officially beginning on January 25, the Spring Festival lasts 11 days ending on February 4. Afterward, preparations are made for the highlight of the new year, the Lantern Festival which takes place on February 8.

The new year coincides with the changing of the Chinese zodiac. A dozen animals – rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog and pig – are featured. 2020 is special due to the zodiac completing its 12 year cycle.

“There are 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac, and rat is the first one. It has just completed a cycle so it will start from the beginning again,” explained Kao.

Those born in the year of the rat are considered to be clever, quick thinking and successful, but content with living a quiet and peaceful life.

Another custom of the Spring Festival is the giving of red envelopes. The money contained inside is considered to be lucky and is generally gifted to those as a sign of well wishing.

For Kao, the most important part is getting together with members of the QCCA community and celebrating their culture.

“We do have a small Chinese community here, but we do have a voice,” Kao said.
