In route news, Qantas kicks off a new route from San Francisco; airlines continue their exodus from China routes, including Hong Kong; JetBlue founder unveils new name, planes for his latest domestic airline; American lands a South American partner to replace LATAM; Delta’s expanded transatlantic joint venture officially launches; South African Airways overhauls its route network; and United drops a route to Washington’s Paine Field but Alaska adds one.

Sunday, Feb. 9 is the launch date for Qantas’ new San Francisco-Brisbane service, which will operate three days a week (Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday) with a 787-9. The carrier already has San Francisco service to Sydney and Melbourne, and it currently operates daily flights to Brisbane from Los Angeles. On April 20, Qantas plans to add new Chicago O’Hare-Brisbane flights as well, operating four days a week, also with a 787-9. According to Qantas, the southbound flight from SFO to Brisbane (QF60) will take 13 hours 45 minutes, and the northbound segment (QF59) will be a 12-hour 40-minute flight. The new Brisbane-U.S. routes were announced last summer after Qantas received U.S. Department of Transportation approval for its joint business partnership with American Airlines. Brisbane is located in Queensland, about a 90-minute flight north of Sydney, and is the gateway to the beachy Gold Coast region and an easy stop on the way to the Great Barrier Reef and Cairns, about two more hours by plane up the coast.

A week ago, the Big Three U.S. airlines suspended service to cities on the Chinese mainland, and this week, American and United decided to terminate Hong Kong flights as well after more cases of coronavirus were reported there. (Delta has no direct service from the United States to Hong Kong but offers code-share flights via Seoul with its partner Korean Air.) American has suspended its daily Los Angeles-Hong Kong service through March 27 and Dallas/Ft. Worth-Hong Kong flights at least through Feb. 20. “Affected customers will be contacted directly to accommodate travel needs,” AA said.

United, which previously cut San Francisco-Hong Kong service to one flight a day effective Feb. 17, has now stopped taking bookings for SFO-Hong Kong flights at least through Feb. 22. (Earlier, United had suspended its three weekly Newark-Hong Kong flights from Feb. 8 through March 28.)

Cathay Pacific has also slashed its schedules due to a falloff in bookings from the coronavirus scare – to the point where the airline this week asked all of its 27,000 employees to plan on taking three weeks of unpaid leave from March through June. Cathay expects its total capacity worldwide to drop by 30% in the weeks ahead and will cut its flights between Hong Kong and mainland China by 90%. For its international schedules, the carrier is dropping one of its daily Los Angeles flights and one of its three daily SFO departures between Feb. 18-March 28. Cathay will suspend its daily Newark flight starting Feb. 10 and its Washington Dulles flight as of Feb. 14, and will cut back Boston and Chicago schedules to five flights a week in mid-February. The carrier has set up a special web page here with the latest coronavirus information and a flight status check.

As a Hong Kong footnote, Feb. 8 is the day when financially troubled Hong Kong Airlines has said it would discontinue its Los Angeles-Hong Kong service. LAX was the carrier’s last remaining U.S. gateway.

The Chinese government has reportedly asked its national carriers not to suspend all service to international destinations, but they are cutting back. Beijing-based Air China will reportedly reduce its U.S. service to four cities on two combined routes starting Feb. 11, with a total of only seven flights a week. That will include four weekly flights from Beijing to San Francisco via a stop in Los Angeles, and three a week flights from Beijing to New York and Washington.

China Southern has reduced its Guangzhou-San Francisco schedule from six flights to four from now through Feb. 14, and will cancel the route from Feb. 15 through March 28. Its daily A380 service between Los Angeles and Guangzhou will be axed from Feb. 13 through March 28. And China Southern will trim its Guangzhou-New York JFK schedule from seven flights a week to four from Feb. 10-15 and then cancel it through March 28.

According to Routesonline.com, China Eastern is slashing its U.S. schedules. It is reportedly ending its Shanghai-San Francisco daily flight from Feb. 10 through March 28 and reducing its LAX-Shanghai schedule from 14 flights a week to as few as three from Feb. 10 through March 28. And China’s Hainan Airlines has suspended a number of U.S. flights, including its three weekly San Jose-Beijing flights, through the end of March.

Remember those various reports over the past year or so about JetBlue founder David Neeleman starting a new domestic airline? Neeleman’s company made it official this week by announcing the launch of Salt Lake City-based Breeze Airways, the chosen brand for a carrier that had initially been referred to as Moxy during the conceptual stage. The announcement didn’t include much new information except that Breeze now hopes to start flying by the end of this year instead of sometime in 2021. Breeze has 60 new Airbus A220-300s on order, but instead of waiting for them, it now plans to kick-start its operations by leasing 30 smaller Embraer 195 aircraft from Azul, the Brazilian carrier also founded by Neeleman. Those plans will be delivered starting in May 2020.

“The A220 is ideally suited for nonstop flights between midsize markets that Breeze expects to serve, while the E195s can connect smaller markets cost-effectively,” a company spokesperson said. The airline’s basic business plan remains unchanged: “Breeze’s initial markets will be midsized U.S. city pairs that currently have no nonstop service. The airline startup plans to connect these cities with low-fare, high-quality nonstop flights, with new consumer technology innovations, improving the flying experience while saving travelers both time and money,” the company said. But it still hasn’t said which specific routes it will fly.

Now that Delta has acquired a significant stake in South America’s LATAM and is starting to code-share with that carrier, LATAM is ending its participation in American’s Oneworld alliance and its AA code-shares. But this week American said it has a new South American code-sharing agreement, this one with Brazil’s largest airline, GOL – the former partner of Delta. AA said the new code-shares will give its customers access to 20 new destinations in South America not served by American, and that the code-sharing will soon be “paired with frequent flier earning and redemption on both airlines.” To facilitate the pact, American said it plans to add a second daily winter season flight between its Miami hub and Rio de Janeiro, and to feed more traffic into Miami – its primary connecting point to GOL – by operating a dozen more daily frequencies into MIA from Nashville, Boston, Houston, Orlando, Raleigh-Durham and Tampa.

Meanwhile, Delta this week officially launched its expanded transatlantic joint venture, which now includes Virgin Atlantic as well as Air France and KLM. “Enhanced customer benefits starting Feb. 13 mean that loyalty program members will be able to earn and use miles or enjoy elite benefits for flights on any of the four airlines’ worldwide operations, including a trans-Atlantic trip, intra-Europe hops, or domestic U.S. journey, offering more opportunities to quickly move through loyalty tiers and reach a higher status,” Delta said. “Eligible Elite loyalty program members can also enjoy priority boarding and relax in over 100 airport lounges when travelling internationally.” The four airlines together handle 23 percent of transatlantic passenger and cargo capacity with up to 341 flights a day between North America and Europe.

A week ago, we reported that financially troubled South African Airways had received emergency funding to see it through its restructuring process (called “business rescue”). Now the company has announced a major overhaul of its route network as part of that process. SAA said it will continue to operate international service from Johannesburg to New York and Washington Dulles as well as London Heathrow, Frankfurt and Perth. But on Feb. 29, it will end flights from Johannesburg to Munich, Sao Paulo, Hong Kong, Guangzhou and some African destinations. Some regional flights within Africa will be maintained but its only remaining domestic route will be Cape Town, served on a “reduced basis.” Domestic routes in South Africa will still be served by SAA’s Mango affiliate.

In domestic route news, United has decided to throw in the towel on its three daily E175 flights between San Francisco International and Paine Field in Everett, Wash., north of Seattle. The United flights will end March 4. But Alaska Airlines this week announced plans to add another Paine Field route, this one from Boise. Alaska/Horizon will fly the route once a day beginning June 18. Alaska has also inked a new interline agreement with an international partner, this one with French Bee. The French airline flies from Paris Orly to Tahiti via a stop in San Francisco, and from Newark to Paris.

Flying to Chicago this summer? According to Routesonline.com, United plans to put a 787-8 Dreamliner on the SFO-O’Hare route between June 4 and Aug. 17. The widebody will be used on the westbound UA305 segment and the eastbound late-night flights UA705/724.
