DEDHAM -- Congressman Joe Kennedy III engaged a crowd of nearly 400 people in Dedham at the Motherbrook Arts & Community Center on Saturday, Jan. 18, with his promise to be a U.S. Senator who “shows up” for his constituents.

The former Avery School was rented out for the forum by Kennedy’s team and was packed to the rafters. Announcer Mark Riley recalled an era when Kennedy’s great-uncle, President John F. Kennedy, was one of many historical political figures to speak here. Others included former Boston Mayor James Michael Curley and former Gov. and U.S. Senator David Walsh.

“Of course I knew the name,” Riley said. “But what I’ve come to learn over all these years is Joe is so much more than a name. He embodies public service at its finest.

“He is brilliant, yes,” he added. “But he is humble, he’s down to earth, he’s compassionate and he’s approachable.”

What made Kennedy stand out to Riley from other public servants is that, when Kennedy was asked for aid on literacy initiatives, “Joe shows up.”

Kennedy showed up to Dedham as part of a 14-stop community town hall forum series across the state over a month’s time. He talked about his background studying engineering and then joining the Peace Corps, where he encountered two communities in the Dominican Republic – one Dominican and one Haitian - that suffered “exploitation and degradation.”

“I wrestled with the fact that the law can be so powerful for one community and so powerless for another community about a mile away,” Kennedy said. “I went to law school to find out how that could be. And I found out they don’t teach you that in law school.”

After attending law school, he worked on trying to stop foreclosures for tenants in Roxbury, Dorchester and Mattapan. Later, as an assistant district attorney, he worked on cases involving drugs and domestic violence.

Kennedy said these experiences, as well as his seven years of service as a Congressman, have spurred him to close the disparities between “those most in need of protection” and the wealthy.

“At no time in our American history have we ever had a President of the United States who looks at members of those communities and seeks to exploit, vilify and take advantage of them literally every day, for his own political gain,” Kennedy said.

Yet he acknowledged many of the disenfranchised faced poor economic circumstances long before Trump took office.

“There is not a community in our country where a minimum-wage worker working full time can afford a two-bedroom apartment,” Kennedy said.

“I believe in a country where success can be an achievement,” Kennedy stressed. “And folks, that starts with knowing that the government’s got your back. That starts with showing up. That starts with knowing that somebody consistently is going to be there for you.”

During the past 90 days, “We have been to more Dunkin’ Donuts than you can possibly count across Massachusetts,” he joked.

Some of the issues

Kennedy spent the remainder of the forum addressing a number of concerns ranging from access to medication to Social Security to student debt.

Jerry Shea of Norwood asked what Kennedy’s stance was on Social Security.

Kennedy replied that the average Social Security monthly payment was about $1,200 per person.

“How many people in Dedham could survive on $1,200 bucks a month?” he asked, scanning the crowd for a raised hand.

“Didn’t think so,” Kennedy said to the silenced audience.

He said that the program has been successful for generations, and needs to be kept in place for an aging population, particularly as costs for food, housing and other necessities skyrocket.

Another question, posed by Liza Colburn of Canton, addressed the need to transition away from fossil fuel “within the next six years.”

“What is the most likely piece of legislation that would get us there quickly?” she asked.

“There is zero bipartisan solution that will get us there,” Kennedy said, “because there are no Republicans who will sign onto a bill that will get us there.”

In order for substantive change to happen, he said that Citizens United needs to end and “dark money” and Super PAC money need to be taken out of politics.

Kennedy also said he was the first Congressman to call to end the filibuster. In addition, he said he wants to push to build coalitions.

Doris Dickson from Norwood told Kennedy she is a Type-1 diabetic who does not support Medicare for all. As someone who takes insulin and advocates for fellow diabetics, she explained that insulin can cost between $2 to $8 per vial to manufacture.

“How do we get these prices down from a 5,000-percent profit margin without Medicare for all?” Dixon asked.

Kennedy said the drug patent was sold to the University of Toronto after its discovery a century ago “for a dollar” so that it could be accessible to all.

“Now 26 percent of users ration it,” he said. “There is no greater evidence of a market failure than that.”

Kennedy stressed that there are initiatives in Congress to stop re-patenting. He also wanted to stop single-source providers for medications.

After the forum

In an interview after the forum, Kennedy said he was excited about the turnout.

“The opportunity is to be able to come out and engage with the community in a crowd like we did,” he said. “That’s what this is all about. So far, so good.”

Kennedy also spoke about how “this country has built up barriers” against the most vulnerable populations in today’s society.

“This country has built up barriers to afford suitable access to potential,” he said. “And I think our obligation as elected folks in office is to be able to tear those barriers down.

“So whether it’s access to better medical resources that they need, equipment, medicine; whether it’s putting into place workplace policies that are necessary to enable them to succeed in the workplace; or whether it’s just trying to make sure there are opportunities there for people to have a chance,” Kennedy continued. “When people are given a chance to contribute, they can.”

Kennedy added that special education and Medicaid are other programs that may be expensive but are important to sustain.

“It is important to make sure access goes up, and costs come down,” he said.

“I thought it was very informative,” said Jimmy Coughlin from Dedham of the meeting. “I think the issues that he cares about are the ones that directly impact working families and families that need help by the government.”

The candidate for Norfolk County Sheriff, who currently works for Suffolk County Sheriff Steven Tompkins, said he was impressed with his commitment to mental health.

“It’s a very sobering fact that he said that 90 percent of the inmate population who are mentally ill have substance use problems,” Coughlin added. “That’s something that’s near and dear to my heart and the office for which I’m running. These are people who need treatment while they are incarcerated.”

“He’s a very impressive person,” Josh Belowich from Natick said of Kennedy afterward. “He’s very real. He doesn’t come across as a politician. You get the sense that he’s telling the truth.”
