BEIJING, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- "Jojo Rabbit," an American comedy-drama featuring the signature humor and pathos of writer-director Taika Waititi, is set to hit Chinese arthouse cinemas on Feb. 12.

China's Nationwide Alliance of Arthouse Cinemas made the announcement via its Weibo account Tuesday.

"Jojo Rabbit" is a World War II satire that follows a German boy whose world view is turned upside down when he discovers his single mother is hiding a young Jewish girl in their attic.

It was released theatrically in the United States on Oct. 18, 2019 and has been nominated in six categories for the 2020 Academy Awards.

Taika Waititi, originally from New Zealand, is best known for directing the Marvel blockbuster "Thor: Ragnarok."
