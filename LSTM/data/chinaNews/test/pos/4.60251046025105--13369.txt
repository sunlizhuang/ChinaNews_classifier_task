TUNIS, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- Tunisia's International Centre for Strategic, Security and Military Studies (CIESSM) held a conference on China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

The conference focused on the definition of the BRI, the new concept of the Silk Road, the political and economic relations between Tunisia and China and the assets of the BRI philosophy.

The event, held on Thursday, was attended by Chinese Ambassador to Tunisia Wang Wenbin, Tunisian politicians, and academics and economic experts who presented the contribution of the BRI to socio-economic development in Tunisia.

Wang said the BRI aims to establish a model of cooperation.

"Since the launch of China's BRI, the Chinese government had concluded some 199 agreements with 137 countries and 30 international organizations by the end of 2019," he told the conference.

"The BRI proposed by China has enhanced bilateral relations which were crowned by the establishment of the Tunisian-Chinese Business Council in 2017," said CIESSM's director Badra Gaaloul.

China has become Tunisia's fourth largest trade partner and its third supplier, and the Chinese market is one of the attractive targets for Tunisian tourism, according to Gaaloul.

"Tunisia's relations with China must be strategic, promising and deep to create wealth and common prosperity," said Moez Joudi, president of the Tunisian Association of Governance.

The BRI, proposed by China in 2013, aims at building trade and infrastructure networks connecting Asia with Europe, Africa and beyond.
