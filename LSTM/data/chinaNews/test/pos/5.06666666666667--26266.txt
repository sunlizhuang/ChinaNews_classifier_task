Hundreds of people lined the streets of Newcastle and witnessed a feast of culture at the annual Chinese New Year celebration.

Onlookers watched as the parade made its way up Blackett Street and on to Bath Lane before arriving under the arch on Stowell Street where groups performed a variety of dance routines.

Ley Ton recently moved to Newcastle from the Yunnan province of China to study and he said it reminded him of the celebrations he would attend back home.

He said: "This is my first time at the Chinese New Year festival in Newcastle and I'm from China so it reminds me of being back home.

"It's amazing that there are so many people here today.

"Most of the cities in the UK have Chinatowns now and I just think it's wonderful."

It is a particularly special year for the 24-year-old, as he was born in the Year of the Rat.

He added: "This is my year! I am from the year of the rat."

As Chinese music played in Stowell Street, performers draped in colourful outfits showed off their dragon, lion and unicorn dance routines as the crowd clapped and cheered.

Firecrackers marked the end of the parade, which were set off as one of the dragons continued to dance beneath the archway.

Friends Jodie McElderry and Stuart Pearson live in Newcastle and this was their first time to the parade as well.

Jodie said: "We think it's been brilliant. Next time we come here we will know where to stand so we can get a better view."

Paul Morrison, from County Durham, travelled into the city for the celebration specially for his 10-year-old son Ryan.

Paul said: "It's more for him than for me. He wanted to come and see it.

"I think it is great. It is just good to see different cultures and it is an incredible experience."

Ryan added: "I think it's good and very artsy."

The celebrations wrapped up with the final set of activities at 3.30pm with more dancing and firecrackers.
