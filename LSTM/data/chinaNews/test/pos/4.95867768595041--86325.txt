I sit down with photographer Yiwei Li at a café in the city centre. Blizzards have been ravaging the country, but today is a calm day, although another storm is on its way.

“One of my favourite things to do is to stay at home and listen to the bad weather,” says Yiwei as she sips her hot tea. “I really like the sound of the storm hitting the windows.” She moved to Iceland six years ago, having looked all over for interesting schools teaching design and visual communication. She quickly found that Northern Europe would be the best fit for her, even though she had never been there. Something about the culture, the style, and the climate beguiled her, so after applying for art schools in Iceland and Norway, she accepted an offer of admission from the Iceland University of the Arts. “It’s far enough away from China,” Yiwei laughs when asked about why she chose Iceland. “I like cold places. I think I can handle more cold than the average person.” Yiwei is no stranger to grand landscapes and tourists, having grown up in Guilin, China, a location famous for its natural beauty – and the side effects of mass tourism. She even feels her hometown in China and her adopted home of Reykjavík are connected in some special way. Large cities with huge crowds aren’t for her, which makes Iceland a dream spot. “It’s cold enough and not too many people,” she says with a smile.
