ISLAMABAD: Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs Andleeb Abbas on Thursday said the government would support every initiative, whether bilateral or multilateral, aimed at bringing peace and stability in Afghanistan.

She was speaking at a multilateral dialogue on the future of the Afghan peace process with attendees from Afghanistan, Pakistan, China, USA, UK and Denmark organised by the Royal Danish Defense College and the Centre for Research and Security Studies.

The event was also attended by Chinese Ambassador Yao Jing, Ambassador of Denmark Rolf Holmboe and Special Assistant to Prime Minister on National Security Division Dr Moeed Yusuf.

Mr Jing appreciated Pakistan’s efforts in moving the process forward, and reiterated China’s support for a political solution to the Afghan conflict.

“Peace in Afghanistan is of key importance to the region, and especially Pakistan, as Afghanistan remains the heart of Asia.”

He said China would contribute to any peace agreement through a variety of mechanisms, as the process has reached a serious phase. He said people of Afghanistan deserved peace and stability through a process led and owned by Afghans to ensure success.

Dr Yusuf said Pakistan had been concertedly pushing for a political and amicable solution. It is important that all sides collaborate on how to get Afghanistan to the finish line and secure a sustainable peace, where long-term perspectives such as economic development and refugee reintegration are incorporated.

The sessions during the dialogue revolved around how to promote intra-Afghan peace talks, how to engage with external stakeholders in the Afghan peace process, and finally how infrastructure investments and economic development support the process of stabilisation.

The dialogue was concluded with remarks from Mr Holmboe, who explained the importance of creating peace agreements which can be successfully implemented at least at the strategic level.

Drawing upon his experiences in Sudan, Syria and Lebanon, he emphasised the importance of local stabilisation through social economic progress, rule of law, education, and service delivery.
