The outbreak of coronavirus is a "significant hit" to the UK's brown crab industry because of the large volume of brown crab typically exported to China for Chinese New Year celebrations.

David Markham, director of Devon-based The Blue Sea Food Company, told Undercurrent News a "big chunk" of both live and frozen brown crab the firm sells to China is destined for consumption at Chinese banquets and dinners and for sharing as gifts during the two-week long festival.

"The real bugger for everyone is Chinese new year is the big time," Markham told Undercurrent on Thursday (Jan. 30). "We've got the other side of the business too, but it's cutting into cash at this time of year when it's usually quiet anyway."

He confirmed the firm is no longer sending live brown crab to China. On Thursday, Netherlands, Rotterdam-based crab packer Le Petit Pecheur also confirmed it had halted exports to China of live brown crab.

Markham said some UK and Irish live crab packers are solely focused on China.

"I think there are 36 approved exporters and probably not all that doing it [live], but for the 10, 12, you know, serious exports of live crab, we'd all be looking to do between five and 15 [metric] tons a week each over that period of time. And a lot of them, that's all they have - it's all they do."

Markham said the crisis could affect the rest of the fishing season, as stocks in China were already high. Landing prices had firmed in the run-up to Chinese New Year due to bad weather conditions and short supply. He said last Friday the firm had "overpaid" at the docks given this week usually sees a peak in demand.

"Hopefully it [frozen crab] won't just sit there and they [Chinese] will sell it. But they were carrying quite a lot of crab from the year before anyway. So there's a possibility that it will roll on and effect next year's season as well, which would be a problem."

The UK exports as much as 5,000t of live brown crab to China each year, according to Markham. "That is a huge amount of money and a big chunk of the fishery, especially as you know, a couple of years ago, the price of frozen whole crab was really high.

"So there's quite a few people who went and built boats that are all gonna start arriving in the next 12 months and there'll be more crab landed. That's going to be very interesting if demand from China doesn't kick up again."

In the meantime, fishermen may decide to call off fishing. "I know some of the boats will carry on landing now, but others will just tie up or either get a refurbishment a bit earlier because prices will come down."
