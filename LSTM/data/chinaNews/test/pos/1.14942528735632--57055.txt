The bread and butter of Oakland Community College's Farmington Hills campus will move to a new home in a few years. The college plans to move its well-known culinary program to Royal Oak in about three years.

OCC Chancellor Peter Provenzano said the Farmington Hills campus, also known as Orchard Ridge, will undergo a series of renovations in the next few years that will facilitate the culinary program's move east.

"It really made more sense to us to move it to Royal Oak because it would make it more accessible to the public and really allow us to highlight the program more," Provenzano said. "It's in that urban setting right on main street and the accessibility and exposure is tremendous. It is far greater than something we could achieve at any of the other campuses just because of its location."

OCC's Royal Oak campus is located in the city's downtown, which is known in part for its robust restaurant scene. Provenzano said the culinary program will be housed in a yet-to-be-constructed building attached to the existing campus.

The chancellor said the city's restaurant association is eager to work with students. College officials hope the location will create plenty of opportunities for pop-up kitchens at nearby restaurants, mentoring and internships.

"They've talked to us about job shadowing where students could shadow and determine whether or not culinary is something they're truly interested in," Provanzano said. "There's being a chef and there's owning a restaurant, and those can be two different things."

The program will continue at the Farmington Hills location in the near future as the new Royal Oak building gets constructed. Provanzano said the early announcement should help make the transition easy for staff and students.

Even though the culinary program is leaving the Orchard Ridge campus, Provanzano said OCC will continue to invest in the campus. In the next few years, boiler replacements, new technology in the theater, repaving in parking lots, new signage and overall modernization of the campus are in the works.

OCC's study abroad program will also continue to be mostly housed in Farmington Hills, and the college's mental health and social work program will move there in the fall from Auburn Hills.

The large kitchen in the campus' J Building, where the culinary program is currently housed, will likely continue to operate for catering events. Though the student-run restaurants in Farmington Hills might continue to operate after the culinary program moves, Provenzano said that is unlikely.

"We have this wonderful kitchen here at Orchard Ridge," Provenzano said. "So I see us using that even if culinary is not headquartered here. Because we have the theater here, because this is such a vibrant campus I see us having functions at, I see the need to have a kitchen and some sort of facility to host events."
