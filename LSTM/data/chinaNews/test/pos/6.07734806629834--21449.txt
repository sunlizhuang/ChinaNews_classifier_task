CASPER, Wyo. (Wyoming News Now) Paradise Valley Elementary School's halls were transformed to celebrate the Lunar New Year. The school is home to the Mandarin-Chinese Dual Language Immersion program. This celebration involved all students, DLI and traditional.

"The Clever Rat" was performed by all students and DLI students had a performance after. "The Clever Rat" tells the story of the 12 zodiac animals and how the rat became the first.

5th graders were the first to perform this morning. Many have been involved in the Lunar New Year celebration since they were in kindergarten.

"It's definitely hard to see that we won't be able to do this anymore. 5th graders always get to have such a good time since this is their last year and they get to kind of pass this on to the further generations," Emma Doherty, Paradise Valley Elementary student, said.

Students and staff prepared for the performance for more than a month. Every student played a special part.

"Whether it's voice-overs, music to the credits and their voices, percussion or movement. I make sure that every student really has a unique part," Nathan Gurtler, Paradise Valley Elementary music teacher, said.

Paradise Valley Elementary staff takes pride in being able to share the Chinese culture with their students.

"The Chinese New Year or the Lunar New Year celebration is a cultural celebration that we're exposing all of our students to. We're giving them an opportunity to live outside of Wyoming and see what things are like in other parts of the world," Brett Thielbar, Paradise Valley Elementary Principal, said.

Gurtler and Thielbar said the celebration would not have been possible without the hard work of the students, staff and volunteers.

Friday night, Paradise Valley Elementary School DLI students will continue the celebration at The Nicolaysen Art Museum. The fundraiser will help 4th grade DLI students raise money for their trip to China in 2021.
