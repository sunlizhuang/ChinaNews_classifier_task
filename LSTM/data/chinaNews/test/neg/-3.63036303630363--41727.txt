Cebu Gov. Gwendolyn Garcia said she prefers to implement a 14-day quarantine among Chinese nationals and tourists arriving in Cebu instead of totally banning their entry into the province in the light of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) spread.

During a full multisectoral council meeting on Thursday, Garcia clarified that as local chief executive, she cannot impose a ban on travelers from China because this will have an implication on foreign relations, in which policy-making rests purely on the President as the Chief Executive.

“We are not banning them. These are not pieces of meat that we are talking about. They are human beings like us and we are living together in one universe, one continent and one region,” she said.

“I believe that a quarantine will be more humane to address the emergency,” she added as a ban may discourage Chinese tourists from entering the country.

President Rodrigo Duterte, through Sen. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go, has ordered the temporary ban on Chinese nationals coming from Wuhan City and its province Hubei which is said to be the source of the nCoV.

As this developed, the GMR-Megawide Cebu Airport Corporation (GMCAC), private operator of the Mactan Cebu International Airport (MCIA), estimated that with the temporary ban on Chinese nationals from Wuhan and Hubei, there will be a drop on its arrivals by at least a thousand passengers daily.

The average daily arrivals of Chinese nationals at MCIA is at 1,500 passengers.

There are seven airline companies that are serving the China-Cebu route including Cebu Pacific, Eva Air, Xiamen Airlines, China Eastern, Lucky Air, Pan Pacific and Cathay Pacific. Philippine Airlines has no direct flights from China to Cebu and vice-versa.

However, China flights from Shanghai, Beijing, Xiamen, Macau and Hong Kong remain operational.
