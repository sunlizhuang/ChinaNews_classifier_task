SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) – Facebook Inc said it will take down misinformation, or fake news, about China’s fast-spreading coronavirus, in a rare departure from its usual approach to dubious health content that is presenting a fresh challenge for social media companies. The coronavirus outbreak has stoked a wave of anti-China sentiment around the globe. Those companies, like Facebook in other cases, rely on techniques such as elevating medical information from authoritative public health sources and warning users about content that has been debunked. TikTok, owned by China’s Bytedance, and Pinterest Inc do ban health misinformation and are actively removing false coronavirus content, they told Reuters. Facebook, under fierce scrutiny worldwide in recent years over its privacy and content practices, has previously removed vaccine misinformation in Samoa, where a measles outbreak killed dozens late last year.
