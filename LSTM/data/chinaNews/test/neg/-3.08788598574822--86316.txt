Coronavirus is continuing to spread across the world with the number of cases rising each day.

In China, where the outbreak began, there are now more than 77,000 cases, while the death toll has risen to 2,663.

On Sunday, South Korea was put on high alert by president Moon Jae-in as authorities reported a further 123 cases, increasing the total of confirmed cases to 556, with five deaths.

And closer to home, 50,000 residents in northern Italy have been put into lockdown for a fortnight.

Due to changes in the severity of the virus in a number of destinations, the Department of Health has updated its travel advice on Tuesday for Britons returning to the UK.

They have provided a list of destinations where people need to self-isolate on their return, whether they have symptoms or not, as well as giving steps on what to do if you do need to stay indoors.
