The coronavirus outbreak claimed its first life in the Chinese capital of Beijing, officials confirmed Monday.

The city's municipal health authority said the patient was a 50-year-old man who had recently traveled to Wuhan, the city where the virus was first detected in December.

He later came down with a fever and sought medical attention last week. His condition worsened on Monday, and he died of respiratory failure.

China is restricting travel for more than 50 million people in an effort to stop the spread of the virus, which has nearly 3,000 confirmed cases so far.

The Chinese government also extended the Lunar New Year holiday by three days in an effort to limit travel.

The mayor of Wuhan claimed responsibility for the crisis and offered to step down amid growing criticism that local authorities didn't respond fast enough to the outbreak.

Health officials have documented five cases in the U.S. across four states: Arizona, California, Illinois and Washington. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is monitoring 110 people in 26 states for the virus.

The CDC has recommended "enhanced precautions" for anyone traveling to China.

Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on a call with reporters on Monday that the virus is not spreading in U.S. communities.

"For that reason, we continue to believe that the immediate health risk from the new virus to the general American public is low at this time," Messonnier said.

President Donald Trump on Monday tweeted that the U.S. is "on watch" for the virus.

"We are in very close communication with China concerning the virus," Trump tweeted. "Very few cases reported in USA, but strongly on watch. We have offered China and President Xi any help that is necessary. Our experts are extraordinary!"

Cases have also been confirmed in Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, Vietnam, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia, France, Cambodia, Canada and Nepal. Ivory Coast health officials are investigating one potential case in Africa.
