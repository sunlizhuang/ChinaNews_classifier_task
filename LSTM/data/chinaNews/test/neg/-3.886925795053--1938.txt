The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) yesterday issued a level one “watch” health notice for travel

to Wuhan in China’s Hubei Province due to an outbreak of a pneumonia-like illness, saying that it has also sent a request to health professionals in Wuhan for information to better understand the disease.

People planning to travel to Wuhan and its surrounding areas should take precautions, including avoiding direct exposure to livestock, raw meat markets and infected patients, the agency said, adding that they should also frequently wash their hands with soap, cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing and wear a surgical mask when entering crowded areas.

As of yesterday, 59 people in Wuhan were confirmed to have contracted the unidentified viral pneumonia, which was first reported on Tuesday last week, with the cases mainly linked to a local market where seafood, live animals and raw meat are sold.

As the Lunar New Year is approaching and many Taiwanese in China are expected to return to Taiwan for the holiday, the Executive Yuan has asked the agency to increase preventive measures and send an investigative group to China, CDC Director-General Chou Jih-haw (周志浩) said on Monday evening.
