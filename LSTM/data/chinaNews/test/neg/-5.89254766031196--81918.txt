Share on Pinterest Officials in New York are fighting a spike in cases of COVID-19. Getty Images The new coronavirus outbreak, initially identified in China, is continuing to grow more than 3 months after it was first detected in December.

More than 117,000 people have contracted the virus. Nearly 4,000 deaths have resulted from the disease.

The disease is called COVID-19 and is caused by infection from the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which is one of multiple coronaviruses that can infect humans.

Other examples include SARS, MERS, and even the common cold.

New York Governor calls in national guard for ‘containment zone’ Governor Andrew Cuomo has called in the national guard to assist with the creation of a containment zone in the town of New Rochelle, New York where the state’s outbreak has been located. Large gatherings and schools will be barred in the town, which is north of New York City. The national guard will be used to help with cleaning public spaces and ensuring everyone has access to food.

President Trump says he hasn’t been tested The president said he has not been tested for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, despite the fact he went to a conference where an attendee tested positive. “The President has not received COVID-19 testing because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms. President Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him,” White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement to the New York Times. The president attended the Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this month, where at least one person later tested positive for COVID-19. While it doesn’t appear that the president directly interacted with the infected person, multiple members of congress reported they interacted with that person. At least six members of congress have been in self-quarantine over concerns they’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus. This includes Rep. Mark Meadows, who is President Trump’s new chief of staff.

COVID-19 has 5-day incubation period; CDC warns at-risk groups to prepare Researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health analyzed publicly available data to find COVID-19 has roughly a 5-day incubation period from exposure to onset of symptoms. The analysis also suggests that about 98 percent of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of exposure. Researchers said this average time from exposure to onset of symptoms suggests that the CDC’s 14-day quarantine period for people who were likely exposed to the virus is reasonable. “Based on our analysis of publicly available data, the current recommendation of 14 days for active monitoring or quarantine is reasonable, although with that period some cases would be missed over the long-term,” said senior study author Justin Lessler, PhD, associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, in a statement. Another recent study from Sun Yat-sen University in China has discovered that SARS-CoV-2 may have an ideal temperature at which it spreads most easily. Researchers analyzed the cumulative number of all confirmed cases in all affected cities and regions from Jan. 20 to Feb. 4, 2020. Their findings suggest it spreads most easily at about 48°F (8.89°C). “The study found that, to certain extent, temperature could significant[ly] change COVID-19 transmission, and there might be a best temperature for the viral transmission, which may partly explain why it first broke out in Wuhan,” wrote the study authors. “It is suggested that countries and regions with a lower temperature in the world adopt the strictest control measures to prevent future reversal.” The CDC now estimates that over the next year, many people in the United States will be exposed to SARS-CoV-2. However, most won’t be severely affected. “It’s fair to say that, as the trajectory of the outbreak continues, many people in the United States will at some point in time, either this year or next, be exposed to this virus. And there’s a good chance many will become sick,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), said in a telebriefing with reporters on Mar. 9. “But again, based on what we know about this virus, we do not expect most people to develop serious illness,” Messonnier added. Messionnier also warned that people who are at high risk, including people older than 60 or those with underlying health conditions, should start to prepare for the outbreak by stocking up on supplies in case they get sick or don’t want to venture out in the community for groceries.

Northern Italy faces lockdown to curb spread of virus In Italy, where cases of COVID-19 have soared in recent weeks, the government is effectively locking down the northern part of the country where the outbreak has been located. The prime minister of Italy declared that travel in and out of certain regions where the viral outbreak is located would be prohibited, according to The Washington Post. However, access would be granted to certain people for emergencies or essential services. About a quarter of the entire country’s population resides in the area being locked down, which also encapsulates the region where Milan and Venice are located. Recorded cases in Italy spiked this week, rising from 1,300 to more than 9,000 in recent days. Reported deaths rose to 631. Globally, there have been more than 117,000 cases with nearly 4,200 deaths. This week, Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), called on countries to make fighting the disease their “highest priority.” Tweet

U.S. cases top 800 Cases of COVID-19 have reached a milestone in the United States, with more than 800 cases reported, according to data from Johns Hopkins. In the United States, at least 28 people have died. In Washington state, where 22 people have died, the University of Washington announced it will no longer hold classes on campus for the rest of the quarter and instead rely on online courses. Stanford University in California is also turning to online courses for the rest of the term. Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said we’re seeing an “acceleration of cases,” and that if the spread of the disease gets much worse, local or federal government officials may start to impose more serious restrictions on travel or social gatherings. “If we continue to get cases like this, particularly at the community level, there will be what we call ‘mitigation,’ where we have to essentially do social distancing, keep people out of crowded places, take a look at seriousness, do you really need to travel, and I think it’s particularly important among the most vulnerable,” he said during an appearance on “Fox News.” When asked if the United States may try to impose a similar lockdown as the Italian government did, Fauci replied, “Given the spread we’ve seen, you know, anything’s possible. And that’s the reason why we’ve got to be prepared to take whatever action is appropriate to contain and mitigate the outbreak.”

Cruise ship with confirmed cases docks in California A cruise ship that’s been held off the coast of California after passengers tested positive for the virus was finally able to dock this week. The ship docked at the Port of Oakland, but passengers and crew weren’t able to simply disembark. Anyone with symptoms of COVID-19 will be taken to a healthcare facility. Everyone else on board will have to spend 14 days quarantined in a federally run facility. The crew will remain on board for 14 days for their quarantine. At least 21 passengers or crew members tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. “The City of Oakland, Alameda County, and the Port of Oakland are stepping up in a major way, and their residents deserve universal praise. They are showing the world what makes our state great — coming to the rescue of thousands of people trapped aboard this ship and helping tackle a national emergency,” California Governor Gavin Newsom said in a statement. Health officials in Placer County, California, said the first person to die from the virus in California had likely contracted the virus while on the cruise ship from San Francisco to Mexico. The person was an older adult with underlying health conditions.

Local U.S. health departments warn they don’t have enough tests With increasing numbers of people reporting symptoms of COVID-19 across the country, local health departments are warning they don’t have enough testing kits. Last week, a letter from Dr. Raul Perea-Henze, the deputy mayor of health and human services in New York, reported the city was given just two test kits. “New York City must receive additional testing kits as soon as they are available from the CDC,” Perea-Henze wrote. “With multiple positive cases, NYC needs maximum testing capacity to enable successful implementation of the public health strategies that best protect New Yorkers. The slow federal action on this matter has impeded our ability to beat back this epidemic.” After initial test kits sent by the CDC were delayed in February, the federal government has come under increased pressure to provide test kits in order to gauge the extent of the outbreak in the United States. Earlier this week, Vice President Mike Pence said that testing would be more widely available to Americans over the coming weeks, according to The New York Times. But he also said, “We don’t have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward.”

Nurses sound alarm over coronavirus response A survey by the union that represents nurses, National Nurses United, found a significant portion of nurses say they feel hospitals are unprepared for a major outbreak of the new coronavirus. The survey included responses by 6,500 nurses in 48 states. It found a significant number of them do not have clear information about how to handle patients who may be suspected of having the novel coronavirus. But nearly a quarter said they’re not sure if there’s a plan to isolate patients with COVID-19 symptoms. Just under 30 percent report they know there’s a plan to isolate patients with symptoms of COVID-19. Additionally, access to medical supplies is becoming an issue. Only 63 percent of nurses report having access to the N95 respirator face mask in their workplace. In addition to the survey, during a press conference, a statement was read from a nurse in California who cared for a patient with COVID-19. The unnamed nurse reported they developed symptoms of COVID-19 but haven’t been tested yet despite both their doctor and county health officials wanting them to be tested. According to their statement, the CDC determined that because they were wearing protective gear while caring for the patient, they weren’t able to contract the virus. “What kind of science-based answer is that?” questioned the registered nurse in her statement released by the union. She continued: “[The CDC] claim[s] they prioritize running samples by illness severity and that there are only so many to give out each day. So I have to wait in line to find out the results. This is not the ticket dispenser at the deli counter; it’s a public health emergency! I am a registered nurse, and I need to know if I am positive before going back to caring for patients.” “I am appalled at the level of bureaucracy that’s preventing nurses from getting tested,” she said. “That is a healthcare decision my doctor and my county health department agree with. Delaying this test puts the whole community at risk.”

Governors declare state of emergency Multiple governors including those of California, New York, Maryland, and Washington have now declared a state of emergency to better deal with the outbreak in their states. “The State of California is deploying every level of government to help identify cases and slow the spread of this coronavirus,” said Governor Gavin Newsom earlier this week. “This emergency proclamation will help the state further prepare our communities and our healthcare system in the event it spreads more broadly.” Health officials have been trying to stop the virus from spreading widely in the United States, but multiple cases of unknown origin have been detected across the country. In Washington state, the health department reported that 13 people have died. Many people who died had been at a nearby nursing home where the virus appears to have spread. “This is a tragic loss of life and we share our heartfelt condolences with the family,” Dr. Jeff Duchin, health officer for public health, Seattle & King County, said after the first death reported. The federal government recently passed an $8.3 billion aid bill to provide funds to help fight the outbreak. Officials likely have a dwindling amount of time to stop the virus from becoming a pandemic. A new summary found that one way to slow the disease may be by simply getting a thorough travel history from patients.

How many people have it? More than 117,000 people have contracted the virus first detected in December. While first seen in China, now the disease has been found to be spreading in multiple countries, including South Korea, Iran, Italy, and the United States. Over 4,000 people have died from the virus globally. The vast majority of people who have contracted it and died are in China. More people have died from this new coronavirus in 3 months than in the entire duration of the 2003 SARS outbreak. However, the overall death rate is still much lower for this virus (around 2–3 percent) than the SARS virus (around 10 percent). Other updates on the outbreak can be found here.

The WHO says the fatality rate is around 3 percent for COVID-19 In a press briefing, officials from the WHO said the fatality rate for COVID-19 may be higher than previously realized. Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, said in a statement that SARS-CoV-2 doesn’t appear to spread as efficiently as the flu. “This virus is not SARS, it’s not MERS, and it’s not influenza. It is a unique virus with unique characteristics,” he said. But it may be more deadly. “Globally, about 3.4 percent of reported COVID-19 cases have died,” he said. “By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1 percent of those infected.” He pointed out one reason for those different fatality rates is that there are vaccines and antiviral medications to help treat flu symptoms. But nothing yet for COVID-19. Additionally, he said that according to evidence from China, only 1 percent of COVID-19 cases have no symptoms, and many people develop symptoms later on. Tweet

How to stock your medicine cabinet for the coronavirus As the outbreak continues to spread, there are ways you can prepare. Among them is simply stocking up your medicine cabinet with over-the-counter cold and flu medications. While they can’t cure the virus, they can help relieve symptoms of mild cases.

WHO declares ‘very high’ threat due to COVID-19 On Feb. 28, the WHO raised the threat assessment of the coronavirus to its highest level. Ghebreyesus briefed reporters on the status of the outbreak. “We have now increased our assessment of the risk of spread to and the risk of impact of COVID-19 to very high at global level,” he said. However, Ghebreyesus reported that the virus doesn’t appear to be spreading so rapidly that it can’t be stopped yet. “Most cases can still be [traced] to known contacts or clusters of cases. We do not see evidence as of yet that the virus is spreading freely in communities, as long as that is the case we still have a chance of containing this virus,” he said.

CT scans speed diagnosis of COVID-19 Researchers from Mount Sinai confirm they can use CT scans to speed diagnosis of individuals with symptoms of COVID-19. A lack of testing in the United States had drawn concern from experts worried that officials may be missing people who could have contracted the virus. Testing kits from the CDC were delayed after issues were found in results during quality control testing. Without access to test kits, samples had to be sent to CDC headquarters, delaying test results. The New York–based researchers published their findings in the journal Radiology. In 33 patients scanned 3 to 5 days after symptoms, the radiologists detected hazy findings in the lungs called “ground glass opacities,” indicative of the disease. Patients examined 6 to 12 days afterward universally showed signs of lung disease. “If coronavirus should continue to spread and impact the United States or elsewhere more significantly, this study equips radiologists with the knowledge to recognize and more confidently suggest if a patient has COVID-19 or pneumonia due to another cause,” said co-author Michael Chung, MD, assistant professor of diagnostic, molecular, and interventional radiology at the Icahn School of Medicine, in a statement. However, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) analyzed records of China’s reported cases of COVID-19 from Dec. 8 to Feb. 11 to find that a little more than 1 percent of people with the virus showed no sign of infection.

Research finds new ways the virus can spread Researchers are studying how people with the virus shed it and what impact it’s having on affected populations. One new study has found answers that many won’t find comforting. Testing and confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently carried out by oral swabs. But research published Feb. 17 in Emerging Microbes & Infections finds evidence that there’s an oral-fecal transmission route. The scientists reported that viruses’ genetic material can be detected in both anal swabs and blood samples. Crucially, evidence of the new coronavirus was found in anal swabs and blood — even when it wasn’t detected using oral swabs. According to the study, this was particularly true for those patients receiving supportive care for several days.

Who is most at risk? Although medical staff, people with illnesses, and older adults are most at risk, more than 80 percent of COVID-19 cases have been mild, according to a new report from the Chinese CDC. Hubei province in China, where the infection is believed to have originated, is the hardest hit, according to the report. The province’s death rate is almost 3 percent, compared with just under a half percent in the rest of the country.

A lack of paid sick leave in the U.S. could make the outbreak worse One of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of illnesses like COVID-19 or the flu is simple: Encourage employees to stay home when they’re sick. But since the United States doesn’t have a national paid sick leave policy, taking a sick day remains a financial sacrifice for 32 million workers who lack paid sick leave benefits. Without paid sick leave, workers are more likely to come into work sick, exposing their co-workers to an illness. This means if SARS-CoV-2 starts spreading widely in the United States, it could be difficult to stop.

CDC director warns virus may spread throughout U.S. The extremely infectious new coronavirus sweeping through China’s Hubei province will become a “community virus” in the United States, if not this year, then the next, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield told CNN. “This virus is probably with us beyond this season, beyond this year, and I think eventually the virus will find a foothold and we will get community-based transmission,” Redfield said. “Right now we’re in an aggressive containment mode.” Redfield emphasized that the CDC doesn’t have any evidence that coronavirus is “really embedded in the community at this time, but with that said, we want to intensify our surveillance so that we’re basing those conclusions based on data.”

The disease gets a new name The WHO announced Feb. 11 in a tweet that the disease from this new coronavirus will now be called COVID-19. Previously, it had been called 2019nCoV, although many media outlets referred to the virus simply as coronavirus — even though that refers to a larger family of viruses. Tweet

Will the outbreak stop this summer? Experts are still learning a lot about this new virus. But some have hoped that warmer weather will mean a drop in cases, similar to how flu season ends in the spring. But medical experts warn it’s too soon to tell whether the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will diminish this summer. Because it’s a totally new virus, people lack immunity, so even in warm weather months it may still spread across the globe.

How to treat the new coronavirus Since SARS-CoV-2 is so new, there’s currently no cure for the disease. But doctors have been able to use supportive care and other antivirals to try and help patients. Early studies show some evidence that certain medications, including those that treat HIV, may help fight the virus.

Will we get a vaccine for the new coronavirus soon? Multiple organizations are already working on a vaccine for the new coronavirus, but it’s unlikely to be widely released within the year. That’s because rigorous testing is needed to ensure that the vaccine is both safe and effective.

Where did the virus come from? Experts are still investigating, but early research suggests the virus originated in bats and then was transmitted to humans via an intermediary animal. What’s the intermediary animal? Potentially a snake or type of anteater called a pangolin.
