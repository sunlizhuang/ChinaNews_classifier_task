The Trump administration may expel Chinese journalists in retaliation for the expulsion of three Wall Street Journal reporters based in China by the Chinese government.

Bloomberg News reported that US officials were set to convene Monday to discuss how to respond to Beijing’s last week move in response to a racist editorial, calling China “the Real Sick Man of Asia.”

“This expulsion is yet another attempt to control the press, and prevent the world’s readers as well as investors from reading important stories about China,” said John Ullyot, a spokesperson for the national security council.

China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said last week that, “the Chinese people do not welcome media that publish racist statements and maliciously attacks China… In light of this, China has decided to revoke the press cards of the three Wall Street Journal correspondents in Beijing starting today.”

The WSJ has maintained that it did not intend to offend Chinese readers.

"Our opinion pages regularly publish articles with opinions that people disagree - or agree with - and it was not our intention to cause offense with the headline on the piece," the CEO and publisher, John Lewis, said in a statement. "However, this has clearly caused upset and concern amongst the Chinese people, which we regret… The need for quality, trusted news reporting from China is greater than ever; today’s decision to target our News department journalists greatly hinders that effort.”
