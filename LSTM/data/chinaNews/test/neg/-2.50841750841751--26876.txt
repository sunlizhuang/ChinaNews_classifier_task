At least 10 Victorian schools have put parents on urgent alert over the deadly coronavirus, instructing them to keep any students who are at risk of carrying the virus away from school for at least 10 days.

With the new school year starting from Wednesday this week, several independent schools have sent letters that "strongly recommend" at-risk students either remain in China or self-isolate in Melbourne with their parents for two weeks.

However, the state education department has imposed far-less strict regulations. For public school students, only those who have a confirmed case of coronavirus or had close contact with a confirmed case in the past 14 days have been advised to stay away from school.

Elite boys' private school Scotch College contacted parents on Sunday, saying it was "aware of concerns regarding the spread of novel coronavirus".
