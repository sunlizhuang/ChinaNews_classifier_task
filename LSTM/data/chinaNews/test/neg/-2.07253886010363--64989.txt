His mother says Mpetsheni had informed her that he might be going on holiday in Thailand but he never confirmed his travel arrangements.

"We stayed in China as a family from 2014 until 2018, my husband worked at the consulate. Alfa started studying there, he knows how to speak and write Mandarin so he cannot just get lost in China.

"I wish the Chinese and the South African government can just tell us the truth and tell us where is our child. The statements we have received so far a contradictory and they know that. They know that there is something they are hiding. I need to see the information that confirms that Alfa went to Bangkok."
