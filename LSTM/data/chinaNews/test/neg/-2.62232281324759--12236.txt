Beijing: They accuse each other of inciting violence. They denounce one another as corrupt. They call each other terrorists.

As tensions between the United States and Iran persist after the American killing of a top Iranian general this month, the two countries are waging a heated battle in an unlikely forum: the Chinese internet.

The embassies of the US and Iran in Beijing have published a series of barbed posts in recent days on Weibo, a popular Chinese social media site, attacking each other in Chinese and in plain view of the country's hundreds of millions of internet users.

The US Embassy has accused Iran of "leaving bloodstains everywhere." The Iranian Embassy has denounced the January 3 killing of the general, Qassem Soleimani, and vowed to seek the end of "America's evil forces in western Asia."
