The latest patients are all Shanghai residents. Experts reiterate warnings against travel and gatherings as incidence of new infections declines.

Four more coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the city, with another 68 suspected cases ruled out, the Shanghai Health Commission said on Monday afternoon.

So far, the city has reported a total of 299 infections and ruled out 1,130 suspected cases.

The four newly diagnosed patients — two from Minhang District and one each from Jiading and Jinshan districts — are all Shanghai residents who have local registered residency or stayed in the city for over six months.

Among the 299 confirmed patients, aged between 7 months and 88 years old, three are still under investigation for how they became infected.

A total of 97 patients are from outside the city — 66 from Wuhan, 23 from other cities in Hubei Province, two each from Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, and one each from Heilongjiang, Hunan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.

The commission said 230 patients are stable, 10 are in serious condition and 10 are critical. Forty-eight patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital. There has been only one local fatality. Another 205 suspected cases are undergoing tests.

The details of an outbreak among a group of travelers were released on Monday as well.

Two travelers who had recent contact with Wuhan were diagnosed with coronavirus infection while in France at the end of last month. Another two family members, who went to Wuhan and France together with the two, were also detected as suspected cases upon arrival at Shanghai's Pudong International Airport and both were confirmed infected later.

A total of 29 people, including members of their traveling party, other passengers and airline staff exposed to the pair were placed under quarantine upon arrival in China. Three members of the group have been confirmed with infection and the rest are still under observation.



“This case reminds everyone not to go out for traveling or participate in gathers during the epidemic and it's important to wear masks and wash hands if taking public transportation,” said Wu Jinglei, director of the Shanghai Health Commission.

Experts also encouraged people to stay alert even though the number of new daily cases in Shanghai has been dropping.



“There were only three new cases reported on Sunday, which is a merely individual case. The epidemic is stable in Shanghai with some ups and downs,” said Dr Wu Fan, a member of the city’s coronavirus prevention and control team. “The trend means that the measures Shanghai has taken on epidemic prevention and control are effective, but we shouldn’t relax yet. All residents, enterprises, government departments and frontline staff must work hard to make sure every virus-control task is done properly.”
