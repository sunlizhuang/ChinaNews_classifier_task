NEW DELHI: Tata AutoComp plans to invest more than Rs 500 crore to set up new plants and localise electric vehicle parts, as momentum in favour of cleaner vehicles gathers speed.The Tata Group company is forming a division within the company for electric vehicles and it will be headed by AK Jindal, who was earlier heading R&D at Tata Motors Tata AutoComp sees this division to account for a quarter of its overall business in the coming five years, accounting for a minimum of about $300 million. The company has stitched together multiple joint ventures and partnerships over the last 12-18 months to provide endto-end solutions for electrification in segments from trucks to two-wheelers.Managing director Arvind Goel said Tata AutoComp would invest over Rs 1,000 crore in the coming two to three years and more than 50% of this would be in the electric vehicle business.“We are going full hog in participating in the group’s electrification journey. Right now, we are at a starting point, but as the segment evolves, we will be able to supply almost 60% content of an electric vehicle,” said Goel.Last month, Tata AutoComp entered into a 50:50 joint venture with Prestolite Electric , China’s second largest electric vehicle motor manufacturer, for local production of starter, motor and alternators.For the charging station, the company has signed an MoU with Australia’s Tritium. Exactly a year back, it had signed a 60:40 JV with Gotion, which is into the battery pack and battery management systems.
