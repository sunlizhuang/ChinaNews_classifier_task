The spread of a mysterious pneumonia-like coronavirus, which appears to have originated in the city of Wuhan in China, has been met with international alarm as more cases are being reported: At least 213 people in China have died, and over 10,000 cases have been reported so far — the vast majority of them in China, although the virus has infected people in 18 other countries. On Thursday, the CDC reported the first person-to-person transmission case of the coronavirus within the United States, bringing the total number of cases in the country up to six. At a press conference in Geneva, Switzerland, the World Health Organization declared “a public health emergency of international concern” over the coronavirus outbreak.

“We don’t know what sort of damage this virus could do if it were to spread in a country with a weaker health system,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday, praising China’s swift response in reporting the virus and emphasizing that the decision was “not a vote of no confidence” in the country, but a global precaution. “We must act now to help countries prepare for that possibility.”

Last week, Chinese officials began implementing a partial quarantine around Wuhan, a city with an estimated population of 11 million people. On Monday, the CDC raised its travel precautions for China to its highest level, “warning,” urging travelers to “avoid all nonessential travel” to the country. The CDC has also required five U.S. airports with direct flights to Wuhan to implement coronavirus screenings, and is monitoring for symptoms of the virus at 20 airports. Here’s what you should know about the virus.

What is a coronavirus?

According to the CDC, coronaviruses are “common throughout the world,” and they “commonly cause mild to moderate illness.” However, newer strains of the virus — such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) — “have been known to frequently cause severe illness.” There are currently no vaccines developed that prevent against this family of viruses.

According to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Wuhan strain of coronavirus is only the seventh type reported to have afflicted human beings. Per the Washington Post, it was first detected on December 31 in a case suspected to have originated at a food market in the area.

What are the symptoms of this strain of coronavirus?

Symptoms of the Wuhan coronavirus include fever, coughing, and difficulty breathing. The virus is thought to have spread from an animal source to humans. According to The Guardian, “Recovery will depend on the strength of [the patient’s] immune system. Many of those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.”

Zhong Nanshan, who leads a group of experts at China’s National Health Commission, told the Washington Post that the best way to combat the spread of the virus is quarantine because it “spreads by droplets from the nose and mouth.” However, recent reports indicate that the virus could be infectious before people start to show symptoms.

Zhong also cautioned, “There’s no specific drug to treat the infection at the moment.”

How many cases have been confirmed?

On Friday, WHO reported that 213 people had died from the virus, all of them in China, which has seen nearly 10,000 cases so far. An additional 98 cases have been reported in 18 other countries, including the United States, none of them fatal at this juncture.

How many cases have there been in the U.S.?

There are six confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in the U.S., according to the CDC, though it expects that number to rise. Five of the patients have all recently traveled to Wuhan, and the most recent case, according to statements made by the CDC on Thursday, is the result of human-to-human transmission within the U.S. NPR reports that the virus spread from a woman who was visiting China to her husband once she returned to Chicago. According to CNN, of these cases, one appeared in Washington State, two in Illinois, one in Arizona, and two in California. All patients are currently hospitalized.

On Monday, CBS reported that two additional people who had recently traveled to Wuhan are undergoing testing for coronavirus. According to the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, “These people have more mild illness, but both sought healthcare for their illnesses and are recovering.” The CDC is also reportedly monitoring at least 100 people in 26 states for the virus, and has found at least 25 people to not have it.

Cases have also been confirmed in Australia, Canada, Japan, France, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Singapore, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Malaysia.

Are there any travel precautions?

As the number of confirmed cases rises, some airlines are suspending flights between mainland China and other countries. Delta has suspended all flights to and from China from February 6 through April 30, at the earliest. Per the New York Times, American Airlines has also announced that it will suspend service to and from China starting immediately and running through March 27.
