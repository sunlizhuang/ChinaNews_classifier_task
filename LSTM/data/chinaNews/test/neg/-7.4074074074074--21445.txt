Across the country, including in Westchester County, extra precautions are being taken against the coronavirus.



The United States is stepping into high gear, with health screenings at major airports, including John F. Kennedy International Airport, to help stop the spread of a new form of the coronavirus.



There are seven forms of the coronavirus as of Jan. 9. The latest is being referred to as the novel coronavirus.



It originated in Wuhan, China, where hundreds of cases have been reported – some deadly.



Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough, sore throat and fever.



"Our primary concern is in travelers visiting from Wuhan or other areas in China that have been identified as major centers of outbreaks,” says Dr. Sandra Kesh, deputy medical director of WestMed Medical Group.

With New York City being a main hub for international travelers, Kesh says it’s important to be mindful.



She says just like other viruses, contact within 6 feet puts someone at risk.



"The populations who need to be the most concerned are those with chronic illnesses that put them at risk for complications, such as asthma, COPD, diabetes and heart failure, and those who are older and might have a weaker immune system,” says Kesh.

Dr. Kesh suggests if you think you have the virus, call a doctor before coming into contact with other patients. At this point, she says there are a lot of unanswered questions.
