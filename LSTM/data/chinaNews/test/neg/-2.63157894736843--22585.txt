The European Union is siding with China over plans to unblock the world's trade arbiter, putting it on a fresh collision course with Donald Trump.

Brussels is seeking a way around stagnation at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) by teaming up with 17 other countries to form a temporary appeals body which can settle disputes.

The move is likely to infuriate the US as it interferes with White House efforts to reform global trade in the wake of what the President sees as unfair support for rivals such as Beijing.

Mr Trump brought the WTO's appellate body to a standstill last year, effectively shutting down the supreme court of international trade by blocking all nominees to its seven-member panel of judges. The court requires three judges to open a new case and has only one remaining.

The new mechanism, which was announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Friday, will put further pressure on the international rules-based order for trade. Backers include the EU, China and Brazil.

The UK will become an independent member of the WTO after it leaves the EU. The trade organisation was established in 1995 as a forum for its 164 members to have negotiations and disputes.
