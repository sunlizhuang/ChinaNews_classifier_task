SINGAPORE - Two more cases of coronavirus infections have been confirmed in Singapore, bringing the total number to 77, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Monday (Feb 17).

One of the new cases is a one-year-old Singaporean baby boy who was evacuated from Wuhan on a Feb 9 Scoot flight. The baby is the first of 174 Singaporeans and their family members on the flight to test positive for the virus. He is in stable condition.

He is currently warded at KK Women's and Children's Hospital and tested positive for the virus on Sunday.

The other new case is a 35-year-old Singaporean man with no recent travel history to China.

The man is warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and tested positive for the virus on Monday.

He was identified as a contact of Case 50, the 62-year-old male DBS Bank employee who was confirmed to have the virus on Feb 12.

Two family members of the DBS employee, a 30-year-old man and a 61-year-old woman, are also linked to this group.

The MOH said at a press conference that five other patients have since recovered and were discharged from hospital on Monday. They are Cases 14, 15, 31, 48 and 65.

To date, 24 of the 77 confirmed cases have recovered.

Of the 53 who are still in hospital, four are in critical condition, down from five on Sunday. The patient who is no longer in critical condition is still warded in hospital.

Case 14 is a 31-year-old man from China who holds a Singapore work pass. He arrived from Wuhan on Jan 26 and tested positive on Jan 30.

The first Singaporean to test positive for the virus has also been discharged. The 47-year-old woman, who is Case 15, was one of 92 Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on the first specially arranged Scoot flight on Jan 30.

Of the 92, five later tested positive for the virus and four have since been discharged. The last passenger, a 17-year-old Singaporean boy who is Case 23, is still in hospital.
