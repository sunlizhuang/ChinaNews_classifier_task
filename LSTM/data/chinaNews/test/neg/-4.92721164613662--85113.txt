China has banned the eating of wild animals amid a bid to fight the coronavirus outbreak as its origins were reportedly linked to the practice.

Communist Party officials have announced the move which was hastily pushed through as almost 80,000 people have been infected worldwide.

The epidemic has killed more than 2,600 people worldwide after spreading from its epicentre in the quarantined city of Wuhan.

It is believed the infection started in the city’s so-called wet markets, were live animals are kept alongside each other.

Scientists believe the markets are hotbeds of diseases as they mutate and transfer between wild animals and then onto humans.

China’s top legislative body – the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress – have now announced a ban on the trade and consumption of wild animals to fight coronavirus.

State broadcaster CCTV said: “Since the Covid-19 outbreak, the eating of wild animals and the huge hidden threat to public health from the practice have attracted wide attention.”

The fast-track decision has banned the consumption of wild animals and his issued a crackdown on the illegal wildlife trade.

Chinese officials have announced the ban has come into effect immediately in a bid to control the virus.

SARS – which killed 800 people worldwide in 2003 – was also linked to the wet markets, and consumption of civet cats.

Yang Heqing, deputy director of the Office for Economic Law, aid the ban on consumption included wildlife protected by the law, other terrestrial animals, and terrestrial wild animals in breeding farms.

The ban also prohibits hunting, trading and transport of terrestrial wild animals for eating.

Fish, livestock, poultry, and other animals that have a long been bred in the country were not included in the ban.

Yang also said the use of wild animals for scientific and medical purposes will be allowed but management of such facilities will be strengthened, reports People’s Daily.

Zhou Haixiang, a member of the Chinese National Committee for Man and Biosphere, said: “Finally there is a complete ban on eating and the trade in wild animals.

“It’s a big step in wildlife protection.”

He added: “The current law only protects limited species of wildlife, but the ban forbids eating in a general sense, not only animals living in the wild, but also the ones in the breeding industry.”

Coronavirus spread has been linked to bats, which then passed the infection to another unknown animal, which then jumped to humans.

It comes as scientists have warned screenings for coronavirus will miss more than half of infected travellers.

A new study suggests that most cases missed by screening are undetectable because symptoms have not yet developed, and the person is not aware they have been exposed.

Scientists say their findings highlight the importance of measures to limit transmission by travellers who become ill after being missed by a screening programme.

Travellers across the world are being checked for Covid-19 to limit further spread of the deadly virus.

Lead author Katelyn Gostic, of the University of Chicago, and colleagues, write: "Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programmes, given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters.

"Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people."

The study, published in eLife, builds on a 2015 study which developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent the spread of emerging pathogens.

The model assumes infected travellers can be detained due to the presence of detectable symptoms, or due to self-reporting of exposure risk via questionnaires or interviews.

In the model, screening for symptoms occurs before questionnaire-based screening for exposure risk, and detected cases do not progress to the next stage.

This allows researchers to track the fraction of cases detected using symptom screening or risk screening at arrival or departure.

The authors say: "Using a mathematical model of screening effectiveness, with preliminary estimates of Covid-19 epidemiology and natural history, we estimate that screening will detect less than half of infected travellers in a growing epidemic, and that screening effectiveness will increase marginally as growth of the source epidemic decelerates.

"We found that two main factors influenced the effectiveness of screening.

"First, symptom screening depends on the natural history of an infection - individuals are increasingly likely to show detectable symptoms with increasing time since exposure."

They add that a fundamental challenge of screening is detecting infected people during the incubation period, or early after the onset of symptoms.

Secondly, screening depends on whether exposure risk factors exist that would facilitate specific and reasonably sensitive case detection by questionnaire.

The researchers say: "The confluence of these two factors led to many infected people being fundamentally undetectable in our model.

"Even under our most generous assumptions about the natural history of Covid-19, the presence of undetectable cases made the greatest contribution to screening failure."

They add: "The prevalence of undetectable cases, and our estimate that screening would detect no more than half of infected travellers in a growing epidemic, is consistent with observed outcomes so far."

Researchers acknowledge their study has some limitations, including that parameter values for Covid-19 may be affected by bias or censoring.
