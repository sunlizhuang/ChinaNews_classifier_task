ILOILO CITY: Hundreds of remaining tourists from Wuhan City in China, who are vacationing on Boracay Island, will be transported back following a lockdown imposed on the Chinese City, the epicentre of the novel coronavirus outbreak.

But several residents of Boracay Island have raised alarm and outcry why the flights from Wuhan were suspended only on Thursday.

Eric Apolonio, spokesman of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, said Pan Pacific Airlines and Royal Air Charter would transport their remaining passengers, who arrived before the lockdown was implemented.

The two airlines operate a total of six chartered flights from Wuhan to Kalibo and back weekly.

A Pan-Pacific Airline flight with 135 passengers arrived at the Kalibo International Airport (KIA) about 6am on Thursday, the last flight before the lockdown was imposed.

Representatives of the airlines, in a meeting with the Civil Aeronautics Board and CAAP, subsequently decided to suspend indefinitely flights between Wuhan and Kalibo.

Apolonio said the 135 passengers were allowed to deplane and proceed to Boracay after undergoing “rigid” screening from personnel of the Bureau of Quarantine.

Passengers at KIA were individually scanned with hand-held thermal scanners before they deplaned.

“If there is an increase in body temperature, they will be brought to (the) government hospital if necessary, ” Apolonio said yesterday.
