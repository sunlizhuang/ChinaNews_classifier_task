In the aftermath of the global outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (nCoV), city-based information technology (IT) companies functioning in the private sectors have allegedly started asking their employees with travel history to China to provideto ensure that they do not have the highly contagious virus before resuming their duties.After similar complaints started trickling in, the state director of health services has stated that such certificates cannot be issued. The health director has decided to issue a statewide circular soon, instructing the IT firms to refrain from asking for such certificates from their employees.“It is technically not possible to issue such certificates as the incubation period of the virus is 14 days. At present, there is no such solid system in place, and if there are staffers with China travel history, the companies should inform us about the same for us to undertake preventive measures,” said Dr Archana Patil, director of health service.“A team of 10 medical officers and 15 paramedical staff have been sent to Mumbai airport to screen. The companies should not discriminate employees who have travelled to China. The employee should be given a paid leave of two weeks if they have travelled from China after January 15,” informed Dr Pradeep Awte, state surveillance officer.Till February 4, a total of 534 nCoV suspected cases have been tested in India. Of those, three have been confirmed to be positive. Of the tested samples, 160 are from the quarantine centres set up for the individuals evacuated from Wuhan, China. In addition to National Institute of Virology, Pune, 11 virus and research diagnostic laboratories (VRDLs) are performing tests for nCoV. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has also provided testing reagents to National Centre for Disease Control, New Delhi.“Now we have started screening passengers not only from China but also Thailand, Singapore and. Any passengers who have returned from Wuhan with or without symptoms are being quarantined in hospitals. The passengers assumed to be exposed to the virus will now kept under observation for 14 days, which was earlier 28 days,” said Dr Patil.The samples of the suspected patients from across the country are sent to NIV. Eventually, the number of samples is expected to go up. To share the burden, samples will be accepted at two other labs — Indira Gandhi Government Medical College & Hospital, Nagpur, andat Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai.From January 15 to now, as many as 21suspected patients were quarantined across Maharashtra. Of which, 19 have been discharged and samples of all have turned negative. Two patients were under observation, one at GMC, Sangli, and one at Naidu Hospital, Pune, said the officials. Last updated, the one admitted at Naidu has been discharged, with his sample testing negative.
