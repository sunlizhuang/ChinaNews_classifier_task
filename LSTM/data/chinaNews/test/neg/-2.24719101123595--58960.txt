Jakarta | Bali's deputy governor will this weekend be praying for China in a carefully chosen Hindu temple as the holiday island mecca deals with the problem of tourists who don't want to go home.

In the 12th century, the Balinese king who lived in the Balingkang Temple married a Chinese merchant's daughter who became Empress.

Nine centuries later, Deputy Governor Tjokorda Oka Artha Ardhana Sukawati is using that historic link between the Balinese and the Chinese to make a gesture of sympathy as China deals with the horror of the coronavirus.

Some 1.17 million Chinese visited Bali last year, second only to 1.23 million Australians.

Not all were welcome. The local government took action to weed out the "zero dollar" tourist trade, arresting and deporting Chinese nationals who had moved into local shops and restaurants and were extorting their countrymen and women, who signed on for tours at home and spent virtually nothing with Balinese-owned businesses when they came.
