The Brushed DC Motor market dominated the Global Automotive Motor Market by Type 2018, growing at a CAGR of 6.1 % during the forecast period. Brushless DC motor witnessed a significant market growth in 2018. The brushless DC motor is not much prone to damage or breakage and undergoes relatively low wear and tear due to the lack of a physical commutator and brush. Brushless DC motors have a longer lifespan, reliability and efficiency. In a number of applications, the BLDC motor offers significant power density benefits, delivering better fuel economy, reduced weight, and lower emissions. These are used in cabin HVAC blowers and pumps and windshield wipers.

The Comfort market dominated the Global Automotive Motor Market by Application 2018. The Safety market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 7.8% during (2019-2025). Additionally, The Others market is expected to witness highest CAGR of 8.4% during (2019-2025).

Asia Pacific accounted for the largest revenue share in 2018 and is expected to experience the fastest growth over the forecast period. This is due to the increasing development of automobiles in emerging economies like China, India, and Japan. It is expected that North America will emerge as one of the largest region by 2025 growing at a CAGR of 6.2% during the forecast period. One of the key factors driving the regional market is the strong presence of producers in Canada and the United States. As a result of the increasing presence of the automotive industry, Europe is also expected to be one of the largest regional markets and grows at a CAGR of 6.5% during the forecast period (2019-2025).
