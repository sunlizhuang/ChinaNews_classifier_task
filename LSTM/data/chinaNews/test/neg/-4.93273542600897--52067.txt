France’s government is joining Britain in warning against any non-essential travel to China and suggesting that all citizens in China leave while the new virus is still spreading.

The Foreign Ministry issued the travel warning based on measures taken by Chinese authorities, and on “the evolution of the epidemic.”

It says France’s embassy and consular services in China will continue to help French people who decide to stay in China.

Air France has stopped all flights to and from China, along with many other airlines.

France has six confirmed cases of the virus and has evacuated hundreds of people on two flights.

Britain's Foreign Office also is advising against “all but essential” travel to mainland China.

Also, Britain has urged all of its citizens in China to leave because of the outbreak of the new virus, while Belgium became the latest nation to announce a confirmed case.

Germany confirmed two more cases of the virus, bringing its total to 12.

The new cases in Germany include another employee of the auto parts company that was visited by a Chinese colleague two weeks ago and a second child of one of those employees.

A polling agency says Italy could lose up to 4.5 billion euro in tourism revenue this year if coronavirus fears keep visitors away.
