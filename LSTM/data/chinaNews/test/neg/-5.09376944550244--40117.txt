Mumbai: With over 10,000 cases in China and at least 213 people dead so far, the coronavirus has been declared a ‘global health emergency’ by the World Health Organisation. The pandemic threat is not limited to just China’s Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, as several confirmed cases have been reported from across the world.

Canada, the US, Germany, France, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, South Korea, Tibet and Australia are among 19 countries where the virus has spread, affecting over 100 people outside China.

The first confirmed case in India has been reported from Kerala while several others have been placed under observation across the country, even in the national capital of Delhi.

Politics still has an uncanny way to wade its way into a grave situation such as this. As the disease continued to toss around the lives of thousands of people across the globe, the Shiv Sena has accused China of a larger conspiracy.

The party, in its editorial mouthpiece Saamana, has speculated that the deadly virus could have been “produced during an attempt to produce biological weapons of mass destruction by China”.

“China’s biological laboratory is in Wuhan province where the coronavirus was found. The world community must research whether this virus was produced in attempts to develop biological weapons of mass destruction,” the Saamana editorial said.

It expressed concerned regarding several Indians being stuck in China following the outbreak. “In wake of the threat from the coronavirus, several countries including India have put a ban on flights to and from China. This step might be justified but many countrymen are stuck in China. To bring them back is a challenge,” the editorial read.

Raising concerns of the virus spreading to states in India’s Northeast, some of whom share borders with China, the Sena mouthpiece said, “The possibility of the spread of the virus in northeastern states adjoining China also cannot be ruled out. The need of the hour is to deploy special health teams in these states. The virus spread fast in China because it has a huge and dense population and its possibility of spreading fast in India cannot be ruled out.”

India has mobilised a special flight by national carrier Air India to Wuhan for the evacuation of Indians living there. A Kerala student who returned from Wuhan was tested positive on Thursday, making him the first confirmed case in India. Air India CMD Ashwani Lohani said that around 400 Indian nationals will be evacuated from Wuhan and will arrive in New Delhi on Saturday.

Coronavirus (nCoV) belongs to a large family of viruses which cause respiratory illnesses, from common cold to more grave diseases like the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).

The symptoms include acute fever, cough and breathing difficulties. In many cases, the infection could also lead to death.
