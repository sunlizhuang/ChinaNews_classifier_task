Taipei, Jan. 27 (CNA) A Taiwanese woman who had recently been to the Chinese city of Wuhan was diagnosed Sunday with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the fourth such confirmed case in Taiwan.

The woman, in her 50s, was traveling in Wuhan Jan. 13-15 before joining a Chinese tour group to Europe Jan. 16-25, said Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥).

The patient, who began to have a cough Jan. 22, reported her condition to airport quarantine officials upon her return from Guangdong Saturday, Chuang said.

As of 4 p.m. Sunday, 350 suspected cases of the new type of coronavirus had been reported in Taiwan, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center.

While infection has been ruled out in 147 of those cases, four were confirmed as having been infected.

Due to concerns over the coronavirus epidemic that originated in Wuhan, Hubei province, Taiwan’s CDC has extended its highest travel warning to Hubei, urging people to avoid unnecessary travel to the destination.

Also, people arriving in Taiwan who have recently been to Hubei will now be subject to compulsory home confinement for 14 days.
