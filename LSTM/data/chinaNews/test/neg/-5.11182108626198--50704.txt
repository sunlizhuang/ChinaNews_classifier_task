PARIS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Euronext wheat fell on Monday to a three-week low in step with Chicago grain futures and wider commodity markets as investors continued to worry about the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak in China.

Benchmark March milling wheat on Paris-based Euronext settled 1.50 euros, or 0.8%, down at 189.50 euros a tonne.

It earlier touched its lowest since Jan. 8 at 189.25 euros after creating a chart gap in an opening drop.

Chicago wheat also fell as futures on both sides of the Atlantic extended a pullback from 1-1/2 year highs struck last month.

China accused the United States on Monday of whipping up panic over the coronavirus outbreak, which had killed 361 people as of Sunday, while Chinese stocks plunged on their first trading day after an extended Lunar New Year holiday.

Worries about the economic impact of the disease have fuelled a pullback in wheat markets that has also been driven by an easing in prices in top exporter Russia.

“Bearish factors have taken the upper hand on the wheat market and broken the upward momentum of the past weeks and months,” consultancy Agritel said in a note.

“But except in the event of a severe deterioration in the global economic climate, we should rather expect the market to balance itself out with some back and forth around current levels.”

Latest export data confirmed a backdrop of strong demand for European wheat.

European Union soft wheat exports in the 2019/20 season that started last July had reached 16.36 million tonnes by Feb. 2, up 65% from the corresponding period of the previous season, official data showed.

Shipments of soft wheat from France, meanwhile, held at a six-year high in January despite port strikes that delayed loadings and caused logistical difficulties, Refinitiv data showed.
