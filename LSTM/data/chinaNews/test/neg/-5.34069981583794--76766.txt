STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. – As evidence begins to show that the deadly novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) can survive on surfaces, we should all be employing everyday precautions to reduce the chance of infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The best way to avoid being infected with the coronavirus is to avoid being exposed to it, the CDC says, as there is currently no vaccine to prevent the disease, recently named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization.

The virus appears to survive for at least several hours on surfaces, according to the World Health Organization. Yet, simple disinfectants can kill the virus before it infects people, the organization says.

In China, new measures – including the deep cleaning and destruction of paper money -- were announced by the People’s Bank of China, aiming to contain the spread of the virus, which has infected more than 71,000 people globally and killed 1,775, the majority in China.

Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses common among animals. In rare cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

And while currently more than 150 million Chinese are under Coronavirus lockdown, in the United States, there is nowhere near that level of infection numbers.

In the U.S., 15 cases have been confirmed since the first, when a Washington state man was diagnosed with it upon his return Jan. 15 from the region around Wuhan, China. Cases have also been reported in California, Arizona, Texas, Wisconsin, Illinois and Massachusetts. No cases have been confirmed in New York metropolitan area, though a handful of people have been tested when they presented with suspicious symptoms.

Questions about prevention will be addressed during a public lecture and question-and-answer session about COVID-19 to be hosted by Richmond University Medical Center (RUMC) on Monday, Feb. 24, in its Sipp Auditorium, West Brighton.

U.S. officials have announced that they will deny entry to foreign nationals who have recently traveled in China, and some airlines have announced that they will cancel flights to China.

Nonetheless, to avoid potential infection, the CDC stresses these everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of all respiratory diseases:

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe or bleach.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Stay home when you are sick.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash hands.

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.

Follow CDC’s recommendations for using a face mask:

CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a face mask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. Face masks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of face masks is also crucial for health workers.

People who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider immediately, the CDC says.
