Human beings have seen periodic medical threats like the coronavirus as long as we have existed. But this outbreak, unlike virtually all others, is becoming an economic crisis as well as a medical one. It probably won’t throw our country or other nations into a recession, but the very fact that some economists are worrying about that option is telling.

When the new year started, the U.S. economy was in pretty good shape — not superb, but clearly solid. We had just finished a year with 2.3% growth in our Gross Domestic Product, a good reflection of that B+ grade. Then, when January saw not one but two major international trade agreements signed by President Donald Trump, one with China and the other with Mexico and Canada, the outlook for 2020 was promising. Those trade agreements were welcome on their own, but they came from a president who was skeptical of such pacts and eager to use tariffs as a weapon. Those agreements provided the kind of certainty that investors like for long-range plans.

But then the coronavirus, which actually broke out in the large Chinese city of Wuhan in December, erupted into a full-blown epidemic in January. And in our interconnected world, the virus started spreading to other countries, and the negative economic effects did too.

Tourism into and from China is virtually frozen. That’s a business effect so large it’s hard to put a number on it, but clearly it will end up costing hundreds of millions. The union representing pilots at American Airlines filed a lawsuit last week to halt all flights to China — all of them — and other carriers in other countries may follow that action. With a roadblock like that in place on travel, business contacts with the world’s second-largest economy will plunge. All of that hurts hotels, rental car companies and the cruise ship industry. Hundreds of McDonald’s and Starbucks stores in China are closed now and will likely remain shuttered for weeks. Apple is heavily invested in China and thus taking painful losses now.

In the larger sense, many of the world’s biggest companies — certainly including those in the U.S. — rely on Chinese factories for products (often low-cost consumer goods) as well as Chinese customers to buy many of our exports. For example, China was slated to more than double its imports of U.S. ag products such as soybeans and pork. Will that bounty take off this year or be stalled?

In our area, the same mini-surge was expected with sales of LNG, a lot of it on ships heading out of our ports. That trade was ramping up nicely before the tariff wars cooled it, and American oil and gas producers really need it to resume again. Supply has exceeded demand in recent months, yet China could start a buying binge that would quickly erase those problems.

All of this proves that what happens in China doesn’t stay in China, and the same can be said for any other large, developed economy. We all buy and sell a lot of goods and services to each other, and when the hose gets kinked anywhere, workers and CEOs notice it. The coronavirus sent the U.S. stock market down after it had set record highs, though it has bounced back this week. Economists are saying the virus could knock as much as 1.2 percentage points off China’s projected annual GDP growth of 6 percent. That’s a lot, and it means fewer jobs and less profits on both sides of the Pacific.

The big question in all this is how long does it last? Viruses like this do run their course and peter out eventually. It happened with SARS and MERS and Ebola and it will happen with this one. If the coronavirus lasts a long time, say into the spring, the effects on the world economy will be profound. That’s not likely, but no one can say with certainty that it won’t happen. What if, heaven forbid, it spreads in a big way to other countries? If it breaks out in a large economy like Japan’s or South Korea’s, the same negative ripple effect starts again.

The good news, if there is any, is that the world’s economic condition was OK, and it can probably weather a storm like this. If the epidemic fades fairly soon, the heavy business and tourist traffic into and out of China will resume. A strong second quarter this year could make up the losses from January and February. So we all watch and wait. In human and medial terms, we all want this crisis to end as soon as possible. But there is a financial component also. The sooner doctors and economists see the coronavirus in the rear-view mirror, the better.
