The World Health Organization (WHO) has said a vaccine for the coronavirus could be ready in 18 months, as the UN health body announced that the official name for the virus would be COVID-19.

The announcement came as the death toll in mainland China reached more than 1,000, after 108 people died from the virus on Monday - the highest daily toll since the outbreak began late last year in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
