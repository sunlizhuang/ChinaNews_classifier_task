Cowlitz County residents shouldn’t be “overly concerned” about catching a new potentially deadly virus circulating in China unless they have traveled to the area, one of the county’s top health officials said Wednesday.

The U.S. reported its first case of the virus on Tuesday. The patient is a Snohomish County man in his 30s who returned from the outbreak’s epicenter in China last week and is now hospitalized in Everett, according to the state Department of Health.

“The main message right now is the risk to the general public is very low,” said Steven Krager, Cowlitz County deputy health officer. “We want people to take normal cold and flu season precautions.”

Residents, he said, should “keep an eye on the news, but not to be overly concerned.”

The newly discovered virus has infected about 300 people, all of whom had been in China, and killed six, according to state health officials. It can cause coughing, fever, breathing difficulty and pneumonia.

Symptoms of the virus are similar to the symptoms of influenza or pneumonia, Krager said. They include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
