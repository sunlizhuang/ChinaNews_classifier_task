A schoolgirl faces having her frostbitten fingers amputated after she was made to shovel snow with her bare hands in the freezing cold.

Horrific pictures show how little Lu Yanyan, 13, was left with swollen and blackened digits after after she swept snow for hours without gloves.

Classmates were made to do the task at Taipingzhuang Town Middle School, in north-eastern China’s Heilongjiang Province, where the average temperature is minus 10.

She is now receiving emergency treatment at Daqing Oilfield General Hospital but has yet to regain sensation in either hand - with her fingers swelling up like a bunch of bananas.

Yanyan told local media: “It happened because we were sweeping snow. We started sweeping snow as soon as we arrived at school in the morning.

“It did hurt at first, but then my hands went numb, then it stopped hurting.

“I told the teacher my hands were numb. I asked when we could finish and go inside.

“The teacher said there’s still so much snow. When did we think we could finish?”

The fingers on Yanyan’s right hand have swollen to twice their normal size, and she faces the risk of amputation if she does not recover from the frostbite in the next 10 to 15 days, reports said.

Her doctor, burn specialist Fan Weiwei, said: “She was admitted about six hours after she sustained her injuries.

“Her frostbite was the result of long-term exposure to the elements. When she arrived, the ends of her fingers were black.

“Her condition is improving, and her fingers are now a lighter shade of purple.

“The area affected by frostbite has also decreased as her digits regain colour.”

Yanyna’s mum added: “All the doctors in town said they didn’t dare take her case.

“They didn’t want to bear the responsibility if my daughter’s fingers fell off.

“In the end we took a taxi to Daqing Oilfield General Hospital.”

The unnamed headmaster of the girl's school was arranging to pay for the girl’s medical bills with insurance companies.

He confirmed her injuries were a result of her shovelling snow, but added that the school had never dealt with a case like this before.

It is common in China for schools to make their pupils do chores and the girl reportedly did not like wearing gloves.
