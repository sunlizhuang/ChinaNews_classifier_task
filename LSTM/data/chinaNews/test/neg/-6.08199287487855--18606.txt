Drivers Charged – Wrong Way 401

A warning from the OPP: If you drive the wrong way on a highway to avoid a traffic jam you will be charged.

12 drivers have been charged with going eastbound in the westbound lanes of the 401 on Sunday morning in the Shannonville Road area.

Lennox and Addington County OPP say a transport truck jackknifed around 8:30 on Sunday morning and the trailer was blocking both lanes. They say the accident was cleared in about half an hour – but at least a dozen drivers will pay the price for their impatience and have been charged with going the wrong way on the highway.

A man from Amherstview has been charged with setting a fire in the garage of a home in Amherstview. Loyalist Township Fire and Rescue put out the small fire in the garage early Sunday afternoon.

A resident of the home fled when police arrived but was arrested after a short foot chase.

51-year-old John Andrew Woodman is facing multiple charges including arson, mischief endangering life and possession of both methamphetamine and cocaine.

Military – Women

A study by the Department of National Defence says the Canadian Armed Forces will have to nearly double the number of women it has been recruiting to reach its goal of having women make up one-quarter of all military personnel. The internal study was obtained by the Canadian Press through the Access to Information Act.

It says the military would need to recruit about 3,500 women every year in order to meet its own 2026 deadline. But over the past decade, the military has never recruited more than 1,850 women in a single year.
