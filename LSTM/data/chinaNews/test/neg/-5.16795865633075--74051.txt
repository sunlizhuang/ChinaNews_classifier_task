Key Highlights The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies deadly viruses, is about 30 km from the epicentre of the outbreak

The conspiracy theories surrounding the Coronavirus outbreak appear to be spreading faster than the virus itself. On Sunday, joining the list of prominent people who’ve made unproven claims about the COVID-19 – the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) name for the disease associated with the virus that has already claimed more than 1,770 lives – US Senator Tom Cotton claimed that the virus may be a biological weapon being manufactured by China’s military.

“China was lying from the beginning, and they’re still lying today,” Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, said, speaking on Fox News. “And also because there are so many unknowns about this virus. For example, how many people one person can infect once they have the virus?”

Though there has been pushback against such debunked claims, it hasn’t stopped people from expressing doubts over the initial versions emanating out of China over how the virus called 2019-nCoV probably spread, which some officials in Beijing had linked to the meat market of Wuhan. (There has been no definitive statement in this regard by Chinese authorities, though.)

Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai has hit out at Cotton, telling CBS that “it’s very dangerous to stir up suspicion, rumours and spread them among the people”.

Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon has pushed a similar conspiracy theory about the origins of the virus in Wuhan.

Meanwhile, closer home, Congress MP Manish Tewari appears to have joined the conspiracy theorists.

Tewari, who was the information and broadcasting minister in the Congress-led UPA regime, posed this question on Twitter: “Is coranavirus a biological weapon developed by the Chinese called Wuhan-400?” – along with a page and cover image of a 1981 book by an American novelist.

Disinformation and propaganda

Interestingly, which conspiracy theories are more popular depends on which part of the world you are from. In the first camp are those who are pushing the narrative that this was some kind of biological weapons programme being pursued by China that went wrong.

So apparently, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies deadly viruses, is about 30 km from the epicentre of the outbreak. Some non-mainstream ‘experts’ in biological warfare from Israel and the US have used this to jump to the conclusion that China was developing a secret biological weapon.

Interestingly, the Wuhan institute is believed to be the most advanced lab for virus research in China.

Meanwhile, the chief villain of the other most popular conspiracy theory about the outbreak is -- no prizes for guessing -- the US.

Russia is -- again, no surprises here -- the most fertile breeding ground for the “America is to blame” conspiracy theory. Instead of being just confined to social media, these stories are doing the rounds in even some mainstream channels in Russia.

Going a step further, Zvezda, a media organisation backed by the Russian Defense Ministry, published an article in January titled “Coronavirus: American biological warfare against Russia and China.” The article went on to make the outlandish claim that the virus was unleashed by the US to damage China’s economy.

Meanwhile, in parts of the Middle East, some excitable commentators are blaming both the US and Israel, without much proof, of course. For instance, an article in Saudi daily Al-Watan claims that COVID-19 is a plot by US and Israeli drug companies to increase their profit margins!

Rather than getting influenced by conspiracy theories, it is best to rely on credible organisations such as the WHO that are leading the global fight against the novel coronavirus. “The new, or “novel” coronavirus, now called 2019-nCoV, had not previously detected before the outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019,” the WHO says on its website. According to the WHO, researchers in China have not yet identified the source for the virus.
