Cops launch investigation of former minister

Police Commissioner Chester Williams has confirmed that an investigation has been launched into allegations linking former national security minister, John Saldivar, to a bribery scandal involving an imprisoned American businessman dating back to 2013.

Last week, Saldivar’s successor, Michael Peyrefitte, told reporters that an investigation had been launched into the allegations after text messages surfaced in a Utah court showing that Saldivar had rejected a wire transfer and accepted to go to Miami to receive a sum of money.

Saldivar, who was placed on indefinite suspension by Prime Minister Dean Barrow earlier this month, has admitted that he took the money as campaign finances, but there have been calls for an independent investigation of the matter.
