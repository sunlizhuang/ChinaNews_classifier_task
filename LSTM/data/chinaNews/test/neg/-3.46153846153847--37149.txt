We have multiple systems in place to prepare for, detect and respond to prevent the spread of serious infectious diseases in the province.”

Earlier in the week, the province said a man in his 40’s, who regularly travels to China, was considered the first presumed positive case of the novel coronavirus in British Columbia.

The man lives in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and became infected on his most recent trip to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.

Anyone experiencing symptoms of the coronavirus is asked to call their doctor or 8-1-1.
