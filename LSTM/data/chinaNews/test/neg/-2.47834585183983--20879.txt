PLATTEVILLE, Wis. — Several University of Wisconsin-Platteville students who recently returned from China are being monitored for Wuhan coronavirus, a university official said.

UW-Platteville spokesman Paul Erickson said Thursday that six students arrived on campus Tuesday who have recently been in Wuhan, China, including two Wuhan residents.

The first case of Wuhan coronavirus in the United States was confirmed Tuesday in Washington state, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. CNN reported that coronavirus has killed at least 17 people and infected hundreds more around the world.

The two Wuhan residents were screened for the Wuhan coronavirus at O’Hare International Airport, Erickson said. None of the six students are exhibiting signs of the coronavirus, but as a precautionary measure, they’re monitoring their temperatures on a regular basis.

They are living together in a residence hall but aren’t under any quarantine or isolation, officials said.

“The University of Wisconsin-Platteville expresses its deepest concerns and support to the people of Wuhan China, especially those at the South-Central University for Nationalities in Wuhan, China, with whom the university has a long, successful partnership,” Erickson said in a statement.

UW-Platteville authorities have been in contact with Grant County Health Department and the Centers for Disease Control and are following all national and international protocols, Erickson said. UW-Platteville is also monitoring the situation.

The CDC is recommending avoiding non-essential travel to Wuhan, China. On its website, the CDC said Chinese officials have closed transport within and out of Wuhan, including buses, subways, trains and the airport.
