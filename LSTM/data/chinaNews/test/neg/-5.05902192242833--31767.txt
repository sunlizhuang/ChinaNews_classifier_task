As hysteria around the Wuhan coronavirus escalates, nearly 60% of Americans say they aren't confident in Congress' ability to contain the virus, according to a new poll released by the Morning Consult.

A majority of Americans also supported measures to curtail the spread of the virus, including travel bans, enhanced airport screenings, and quarantine protocols.

Nearly three out of four US adults also were as concerned about the domestic outbreak of coronavirus as they were about the spread of Ebola in 2014.

The Wuhan coronavirus has ignited hysteria across the globe as the virus spreads at break-neck speed, with more than 4,600 infected worldwide and five confirmed cases in the US.

In the wake of the craze about the pandemic, nearly 60% of Americans say they aren't confident in Congress' ability to contain the virus, according to a new poll released by the Morning Consult.

Morning Consult, an intelligence company that collects and shares survey and research data, surveyed 2,200 US adults from January 24 to 26 about their concerns related to the pandemic — and they found roughly three out of four (74%) were as worried about an outbreak of coronavirus in the US as they were about the spread of Ebola in 2014.

Roughly a third (32%) of respondents blamed the Chinese government for the coronavirus outbreak, which reportedly originated in a wet market in Wuhan, China. However, US adults overwhelmingly (85% ) supported the country's efforts to contain the outbreak by restricting travel to and from affected areas, a move that's locked down nearly 50 million people.

Although the CDC said the risk to the US public was low, incoming reports of coronavirus cases in the US have left many Americans anxious. According to the Morning Consult poll, 47 percent of its respondents think it is at least somewhat likely that someone in their state will become infected. However, health experts say adults face a greater threat from the flu than from the Wuhan coronavirus.

As hysteria around the pandemic escalates, respondents were asked who they trusted to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The CDC came out on top with 68% at least somewhat confident in the federal agency. On the other hand, US adults reported having "little to no confidence" in Congress or President Donald Trump to prevent an outbreak in the US. Respondents only had slightly more confidence in airline companies than Congress.

As the US government works to protect American citizens abroad in China, measures are also being taken to halt the domestic spread of the coronavirus. Respondents were supportive of a range of measures on travel including "a travel ban to and from affected countries, quotas on how many travelers can enter the United States from those countries, and enhanced airport screenings and quarantine protocols," Morning Consult reported.

Although respondents were supportive of precautionary measures related to travel, they were less open to medical intervention — less than half said they would get immunized if a vaccine became available.

The interviews were conducted online with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.

In addition to screening travelers for coronavirus at certain airports, the State Department has raised the travel advisory warning from level two, or "exercise increased caution," to level three, "reconsider travel," citing concerns of the coronavirus outbreak.

As of today, more than 4,600 people have been sickened by the virus, and at least 107 other people have died — but the numbers of those affected by coronavirus continue to soar every day.
