The mysterious virus from China has arrived in America

The coronavirus, a deadly new disease spreading across China, is now officially in the U.S. Officials from the CDC said Tuesday that the virus that has killed six people in China was confirmed in Washington state. Hundreds of people in China have been diagnosed with the virus, most in the city of Wuhan. But it has spread to other areas of the country, and a handful of cases have been diagnosed in Thailand, South Korea and Japan. With the virus being confirmed in the U.S., I may avoid people for the foreseeable future. Here's what else you need to know about the virus:

How is coronavirus similar to SARS? This outbreak is drawing intense attention because of its similarities to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a coronavirus that killed nearly 800 people in late 2002.

The virus can be spread from animals to people. But it also can be spread by coughing, sneezing and through close contact with an infected person or an object carrying the virus. What’s the next move? The World Health Organization will gather a panel of experts Wednesday in Geneva to determine if the outbreak is a global health emergency.

Trump’s impeachment trial is back in session

The Senate impeachment trial of President Trump resumed on Tuesday with proposals about how to conduct the proceeding. Though lawmakers spent a majority of the day in a fiery debate (we expected this) over Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s proposed rules on how to run the trial, it will eventually all boil down to this: Did Trump abuse his power by allegedly withholding military aid and a White House visit in order to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden? And, did he obstruct Congress by not cooperating with the House impeachment inquiry, including defying subpoenas for documents and testimony? Keep up with our live updates of the impeachment trial here.

Ouch. Hillary Clinton is throwing (verbal) punches at Sanders

So much for uniting Democrats? Former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton completely unloaded on 2020 candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders in a new documentary. “Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done," Clinton said in the film, according to The Hollywood Reporter. In an interview published Tuesday about the documentary, Clinton was asked if that assessment of Sanders still holds: "Yes, it does," she said. In a statement, Sanders did not respond to specific claims made by Clinton but rather redirected focus to Trump's impeachment trial. “My focus today is on a monumental moment in American history: The impeachment trial of Donald Trump," Sanders said.

Ozzy Osbourne reveals he has Parkinson's diagnosis

Ozzy Osbourne is opening up about being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. In a "Good Morning America" interview Tuesday, the Prince of Darkness and his wife, Sharon Osbourne, shared the details. "It's Parkin's II, which is a form of Parkinson's," Sharon said. "It's not a death sentence by any stretch of the imagination, but it does affect certain nerves in your body." Although fans have known Ozzy has suffered from tremors and was diagnosed with Parkin symptoms in the early 2000s, the former Black Sabbath frontman said he didn't find out about his diagnosis until 2019. "I'm not good at secrets," he said. "I feel better now of owning up to the fact that I have a case of Parkinson's."

Scientists just discovered what ended 'Snowball Earth'

Some 2.2 billion years ago, an asteroid slammed into the Earth, leaving behind a massive, 43-mile-wide crater in what's now Western Australia, scientists announced Tuesday. It's the world's oldest known impact site, the new study said, one that also may have changed Earth's climate: It occurred at a time that coincided with Earth’s recovery from an ice age known as "Snowball Earth," where most of Earth’s surface was covered with ice sheets up to 3 miles thick, according to a statement from Imperial College in London. After blasting into the ice sheet, the impact could have released trillions of pounds of water vapor into the atmosphere, a potent greenhouse gas that may have played a role in modifying Earth’s climate.
