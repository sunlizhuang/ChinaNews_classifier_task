Virgin Australia has emerged as the first international airline to completely withdraw all its services between Australia and Hong Kong amid the coronavirus outbreak, citing that the route was no longer commercially viable.

The performance of the route had declined following the anti-government protests that began in June 2019, and is expected to be further impacted by the growing uncertainty caused by the coronavirus crisis, the airline said.

The company said it had undertaken a comprehensive review of the routes, and on Thursday confirmed it would halt service on the Sydney-Hong Kong route on March 2.

November, the airline proposed the suspension of the Melbourne-Hong Kong route due to financial losses, and on Thursday confirmed the last flight would take place on February 11.

“Hong Kong has continued to be a challenging market. With a decline in demand following ongoing civil unrest, and growing concerns over the coronavirus outbreak in the wider region, we have made the decision to withdraw services,” Virgin Australia Group chief commercial officer John MacLeod said.

“While the decision to withdraw from the Hong Kong market has been a difficult one, it demonstrates our strong focus on driving greater financial discipline through our network.

“Current circumstances demonstrate that Hong Kong is no longer a commercially viable route for Virgin Australia to continue operating, however international tourism remains an important part of our strategy through our other international routes and partner airlines.”

The airline said it would make alternative arrangements for customers already booked on affected flights.

On Tuesday, United Airlines said that it will suspend all flights to and from Hong Kong, meaning no US carriers will be flying passenger flights to Hong Kong after this week.

The decision follows a similar announcement by American Airlines, who have suspended all flights to Hong Kong from Los Angeles and Dallas for about two weeks, citing a lack of demand, amid the deadly coronavirus outbreak.

Overall more than 30 global airlines have halted flights to and from mainland China as coronavirus infections continue to soar, and although most flights to Hong Kong have not been affected, some countries and airlines have introduced bans.

Italy suspended all flights from China, including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, until April 28.

The Philippines widened a travel ban previously imposed on visitors from Hubei province, centre of the outbreak, to cover all of China, including Hong Kong and Macau, while prohibiting Filipinos from travelling to those areas.

AirAsia Philippines said it was no longer offering flights to Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Macau and that the measure would be in place until March 1.

Air India will suspend its New Delhi-Hong Kong service from Saturday after it earlier halted flights to Shanghai.

The World Health Organisation has so far said that such limits on trade and travel are not needed to control the spread of the virus.

Less than three years ago, Virgin launched its new Hong Kong routes with some fanfare, arriving with airline brand’s founder, the billionaire Richard Branson, wooing guests and the media with a glittering reception at the luxury five-star Peninsula hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui.

John Borghetti, the then CEO of Virgin Australia Group, told the South China Morning Post at the time: “Hong Kong and Greater China is a key pillar of our international strategy.”

On top of the launch, debt-distressed HNA Group took a 20 per cent stake, and the Chinese conglomerate’s Hong Kong Airlines teamed up with Virgin – both seeking to compete against chief rivals, Cathay Pacific and Qantas, in their own backyard.

“From the outset Virgin was elbowing its way into a crowded market dominated by Qantas and Cathay Pacific. Virgin found its Hong Kong routes were never heavily patronised, and the Chinese connections through Hong Kong Airlines never took off,” said David Flynn, editor of Australia-based frequent flyer website, Executive Traveller.
