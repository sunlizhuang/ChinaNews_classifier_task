Bong Go blasts DoH for failure to trace hundreds exposed to nCoV

LAWMAKERS on Tuesday castigated Health officials for their failure to track down hundreds of passengers who shared a ride with the two Chinese who were infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD).





One of the patients died at the San Lazaro Hospital on Saturday, the first fatality outside China.

Sen. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go, who presided over the Senate hearing on the nCoV spread, urged the Department of Health (DoH) to hasten the tracking of more than 300 passengers who might have been exposed to the deadly virus.

Go, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, said the DoH could tap policemen and immigration personnel in tracing the whereabouts of the airline passengers.

The Chinese couple arrived in the Philippines on January 21 from Hong Kong and visited the cities of Cebu and Dumaguete before flying to Manila. The man died on February 1.

“Dapat hanapin talaga nila. Dapat nila panagutan ‘yan. Dapat nilang i-account. Sabi naman ng taga-PAL (Philippine Airlines) sa akin kanina, binigay raw nila ang mga pangalan (They should find them. That’s their responsibility. PAL executives told me that they submitted the names of the passengers),” Go told reporters.

Some senators castigated Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd for the failure of his department to track down the passengers. Duque, who was grilled during the Senate hearing, admitted that only 17 percent or 57 of the 331 passengers had been tracked down.

Duque said it was difficult to track down the passengers because airlines only shared with government officials the names of those who were on the same plane as the Chinese couple.

Go however told the DoH to coordinate with other government agencies. “Gamitin niyo ang mga pulis. Gamitin natin ang immigration officials. Kaya ‘yan. If there’s a will, there’s a way. May paraan talaga. Gawin niyo na may dedikasyon ang inyong trabaho (Tap the police and immigration officials. That can be done. Find a way. Show more dedication),” he said.

“Dapat ayusin ninyo ‘yung sistema ninyo, coordination, kaya nga meron kayong Inter-Agency Task Force para pag-usapan at gumawa kayo ng solusyon sa bawat problemang darating sa atin (Improve your system, your coordination. That’s the reason why you have an interagency task force, so that you can discuss measures and solutions to problems),” he fumed.

Sen. Francis Pangilinan also took Duque to task for the failure of his department to track down the passengers.

Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade admitted that there was a glaring failure among government agencies to communicate in contacting the passengers seated near the Chinese passengers.

Tugade said it was up to the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) and Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines to submit the list of their passengers because they have power over airlines.

“What is the protocol? It is a sad situation. There is failure to coordinate,’’ Tugade said.

Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr., who attended the hearing, agreed that the tracking down of the passengers was the job of the CAB and the Bureau of Immigration.

Ed Monreal, general manager of the Manila International Airport Authority, however, told the senators that the airlines would not withhold the names of passengers based on protocols.

Privacy Commissioner Raymund Enriquez Liboro said that while data privacy is a right, it is not absolute.

“If a government agency pursuant to its constitutional or statutory mandate, requests airlines to release passenger manifest, the same is allowed under the Data Privacy Act of 2012,” he said in a statement.

“In responding to a critical public health issue like nCov, the DoH has the mandate, purpose and the necessity to collect and process personal data to uphold the public welfare.

Therefore, nothing should prevent airline companies from releasing relevant passenger data to competent and mandated authorities like the Department of Health,” he added.

Alarming

Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, World Health Organization (WHO) representative in the Philippines, said countries with confirmed cases of nCoV need to improve their preparedness to respond to the disease.

Go admitted that the situation was alarming.

“Oo, alarming, high-risk nga ang ating status. Ngayon dapat i-contain talaga natin. Tama ‘yung meron tayong travel ban sa ngayon, at kung kailangan pong dagdagan, maaaring irekomenda po ito ng Inter-Agency Task Force sa ating Pangulo (Yes, it’s alarming, our status is high-risk. We have to contain it. It is right that we imposed a travel ban, and if the inter-agency task force recommends that it be widened, we will recommend this to the President),” he said.

The senator appealed to the public to cooperate with the government.

“Huwag na po tayong mag-panic. Huwag tayong magkalat ng mga fake news. Tulungan po natin ang ating mga kababayan. Huwag nating dagdagan ang problema natin (Let us not panic. Let us not spread fake news. Let us help each other),” he said, adding that those who spread fake news should be quarantined.

Go gave assurances that the government remains on top of the situation and is committed to assist Filipinos and the rest of the world in laying down measures to mitigate the impact of the virus on the worldwide community.

“Since day 1, the whole Duterte administration has said that it has been on top of the situation and is doing everything it can to address the issue. The President, and even a key official from the World Health Organization, have commended the efforts of this government in responding to this worldwide health concern,” he said.

Duque said that of the 80 patients under investigation, 67 have been admitted in hospitals and isolated.

He said the new coronavirus “can survive and stay for as long as ten hours on inanimate objects like keyboards, tables.”

President Rodrigo Duterte has approved the budget needed for the procurement of protective equipment for around 5,000 health workers.

Death toll up

The death toll in mainland China from the new type of virus has risen to 425, with the total number of cases now standing at 20,438, officials said on Tuesday.

The new figures come after the country opened a new hospital built in 10 days, infused cash into tumbling financial markets, and further restricted people’s movement in hopes of containing the rapidly spreading virus and its escalating impact.

Japanese officials were deciding whether to quarantine more than 3,000 people on a cruise ship that carried a passenger who tested positive for the virus. The latest figures are up from 361 deaths and 17,205 confirmed cases.

Other countries are continuing evacuations and restricting the entry of Chinese or people who have recently traveled in the country.

In the province at the epicenter of the outbreak, Hubei, a specialized 1,000-bed hospital started treating patients and a second hospital with 1,500 beds is to open within days.

Other countries continued evacuating citizens from hardest-hit Hubei province and restricted the entry of Chinese or people who recently traveled to the country.

WHO said the number of cases would keep growing because tests are pending on thousands of suspected cases.

Chinese President Xi Jinping, presiding over a special meeting of the country’s top Communist Party body for the second time since the crisis started, said “[W]e have launched a people’s war of prevention of the epidemic.”

He told the Politburo standing committee that the country must race against time to curb the spread of the virus and that those who neglect their duties will be punished, state broadcaster CCTV reported.

Medical teams from the People’s Liberation Army were arriving in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, to relieve overwhelmed health workers and to staff the new 1,000-bed hospital, located in the countryside far from the city center.

Impact

Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd said the economic costs of the infection on the economy would most likely be centered on the tourism sector.

Dominguez also said “it’s too early to estimate the economic impact of the novel coronavirus.”

Meanwhile, the Board of Directors of the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. has approved a benefit package for member-patients under investigation or PUIs for possible 2019-nCoV infection who are admitted in healthcare facilities.
