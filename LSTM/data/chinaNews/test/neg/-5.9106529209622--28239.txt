A brazen airliner is still selling flights from London to the coronavirus-ravaged Chinese city of Wuhan from as early as this weekend, MailOnline can reveal.

For as little as £205 travellers can book online with Air France to fly from Heathrow to the outbreak's epicentre on Sunday evening.

The journey involves an overnight stay at the Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport in the French capital but arrives in Wuhan on Wednesday morning, local time.

MailOnline was able to order £549.11 return flight tickets and take them to the checkout on Air France's website.

The plane would have supposedly flown out of Wuhan on Thursday morning bound for Heathrow.

It comes despite Wuhan and the wider Hubei province, home to around 60million people, supposedly being completely sealed off and quarantined.

Airports were reported to have been shut, planes grounded, and trains and buses banned from leaving or entering the region in a desperate bid to stop the outbreak.

The Foreign Office warned 'against all travel to Hubei province due to the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak', adding 'if you are in this area and able to leave, you should do so'.

MailOnline understands airliners have been given a preliminary travel ban into the city which expires on Sunday. But it is presumed the ban will be extended.

The coronavirus outbreak has now killed 82 people and struck down more than 2,800. Cambodia today became the latest country to confirm the virus has spread there. The government confirmed a Chinese national who travelled to the city of Sihanoukville was infected

The Foreign Office is desperately drawing up plans to evacuate British nationals via chartered planes out of Wuhan.

But despite the stark warning to steer clear of the virus-stricken city, Air France was still offering tickets from London to Wuhan as of Monday afternoon.

The airliner told MailOnline it 'complies with the request of the authorities', who have closed Wuhan airport until February 2nd (Sunday).

It said that if the ban was extended, it will cancel further flights. A spokesperson added: 'Following the situation in China, Air France has implemented commercial measures for all its distribution channels.

'Passengers with a reservation to and from China until 29 February can cancel their trip free of charge or postpone it until 31 May 2020.'

Cases of the never-before-seen virus in China have now been confirmed in every province of China except Tibet.

The Chinese government insists it is continuing drastic efforts to contain the outbreak.

The coronavirus has now killed 82 people and infected nearly 3,000 in under a months.

Scientists following the outbreak closely believe the true number of infections to be beyong 100,000 people.

Chinese citizens have been banned from booking holiday tours and flight and hotel packages in other countries, according to the New York Times.

It comes as leading health bosses in the UK warn the virus may already be on home soil.

Professor Yvonne Doyle said the first case is likely to be somebody already in the UK who did not have any symptoms when they landed.

In hope of halting a potential outbreak in Britain, she said it is 'absolutely critical' the public health service and the NHS are ready for when the first case happens.

The Foreign Office is in talks with the US about how to evacuate hundreds of Britons stranded in Wuhan because of the killer coronavirus outbreak.

Officials are waiting for Beijing's permission before carrying out the unprecedented operation to repatriate almost 300 Britons.

China today announced it had extended its New Year holiday until February 2 to fight the outbreak, which has struck down more than 2,800 people.

Professor Yvonne Doyle, medical director and director of health protection for PHE, admitted that airports are 'important' spreaders of viruses.

But in an interview with Sky News she added: 'The most likely place we might find a case is somebody in the country already.

'It's absolutely critical the public health service and the NHS are ready to diagnose that and are able to designate the person to the right facilities.'

Asked if she was alarmed about a UK case, she said: 'I think, with infections, health is global.

'We've been here before, we've dealt with Middle Eastern virus, we've dealt with SARS, we deal with flu regularly, which can be dangerous, but we're ready.'

And asked if there could be cases already in Britain, she said: 'I would expect so.'

Professor Doyle said efforts were continuing to trace the 2,000 people who have entered the UK from China on international flights.
