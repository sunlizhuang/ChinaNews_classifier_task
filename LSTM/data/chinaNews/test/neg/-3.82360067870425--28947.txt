But their condition is very bad. They are all put inside the rooms of their hostel campus with not much to eat or drink,” said 18-year-old Shreya’s father Shashi Jaiman, who works with Indian Railways.The girl’s father on Monday sent out desperate appeals to the PMO, home minister’s office apart from Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani through twitter.Vrund’s father Ramesh Patel told TOI that the students, who were wearing masks, were all put up inside their rooms and had to walk one and a half km just to fetch water.“Since the last two days, markets have been closed. Even getting proper drinking water has become difficult. Presently, they are surviving on whatever stock they have with them,” said Patel, who works as a primary school teacher at Jesingpura primary school in Tilakwada taluka of Narmada district “The students are cooking on the scarce food stock and having food only once during the day,” said Patel.According to the parents, all other countries are ensuring that students in Wuhan safely return to their homes. “We are also appealing to our government to intervene and ensure the safe return of our wards,” said Patel.The parents had a telephonic conversation with Vadodara MP Ranjan Bhatt who assured them of all the support from her office.
