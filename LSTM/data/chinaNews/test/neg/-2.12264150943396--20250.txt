For more than a year, Justin Trudeau has resisted relentless pressure from China to release a prominent Chinese businessperson wanted in the United States.

The prime minister held his ground after the Chinese government retaliated by brutally imprisoning two Canadians. He stood firm when China blocked valuable imports of Canadian meat and canola.

But as the extradition case against Huawei Technologies executive Meng Wanzhou began this week in Vancouver, Trudeau was being pushed by powerful interests not just outside Canada but from within.

That he still refuses to give in does him credit. "We will abide by the rule of law," he said Tuesday, a decision Canadians should respect and support.

Some people may be persuaded otherwise by the latest arguments from Eddie Goldenberg, a lawyer who was a senior aide to prime minister Jean Chretien. Goldenberg insists that, on humanitarian grounds, Canada's priority should be persuading China to release Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor from their arbitrary, 13-month detention.

The only way to do this, he says is free Meng, who is accused of committing fraud by the Americans. What Goldenberg proposes is essentially a prisoner exchange, something not normally done between supposedly friendly nations like Canada and China.

The same solution was proposed last month by John Manley, who was once Chretien's deputy prime minister. Before that, powerful members of Canada's business community lobbied for Meng's release, partly on the grounds that it would improve Canada's standing with China, now the world's second-biggest economy. Liberating innocent Canadians and protecting Canada's economic future are powerful incentives for freeing Meng. There are stronger reasons, however, for leaving her fate in the hands of Canada's legal system.

For the federal government to intervene and pre-empt a legal proceeding would mean caving in to Chinese bullying. It would set a dangerous precedent that could result in more Canadians being arrested on trumped-up charges and incarcerated in China whenever China is displeased with us.

It would mean that Canada would willingly violate a decades-old extradition treaty with the United States, something that would deeply offend our closest neighbour and ally. It would mean that Canada is prepared to support the rule of law right up until the moment it is difficult or inconvenient to do so.

It would also broadcast to the world that Canada is willing to accept its new status as an unquestioning vassal of China's authoritarian government and meekly obey its dictates. That humiliation should not be our destiny.
