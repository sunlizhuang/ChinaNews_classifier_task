Coronavirus outbreak: From Apple to Google, here‚Äôs how tech industry has been affected Coronavirus outbreak: From Apple to Google, here‚Äôs how tech industry has been affected

People living in China are having sleepless nights and the reason for that is the fast spreading Coronavirus. The latest numbers suggest that the Coronavirus death toll has gone up to almost 170 now in China while nearly 7700 across the world have been infected. The virus is spreading from one country to another and this is worrying not just the governments, but also other industries including aviation, finance and also tech. Several airlines have suspended flights from or to China.

The tech industry is also going through a tough time due to the Coronavirus outbreak. Companies like Apple, Google have shut shops in China, which is one of the important countries for most tech companies, especially smartphone manufacturers. These tech companies have also limited their employees to travel to China.

iPhone 9 delayed or not?

Apple is said to be one of the most impacted due to Coronavirus outbreak but the company doesn‚Äôt accept it. At the time of announcing the earnings report on Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the company is prepared for any impact from Coronavirus on its supply chain.

Apple has shut a total of three stores in China due to the fast-spreading Coronavirus. Earlier this week, Cook informed about the temporary shut down of its Qingdao store. Adding on, Apple has now closed two more stores in Fuzhou and Nanjing temporarily. The company is also limiting employees on traveling to China. All of this could affect Apple‚Äôs supply chain, suggest analysts.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine a scenario where the supply chain isn‚Äôt disrupted,‚Äù a veteran industry analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy told Bloomberg. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs one major hiccup in the raw materials, fabrication, assembly, test, and shipping, it will be a disruption,‚Äù Moorhead further added.In addition, TF Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also suggested that Coronavirus can affect the launch of the affordable iPhone, said to be iPhone 9/ iPhone SE 2, which is tipped to take place in the month of March this year.

Talking about how Apple has prepared for any impact from Coronavirus, Cook said, ‚ÄúWe do have some suppliers in the Wuhan area. For all of the suppliers, there are alternate sources and we‚Äôre obviously working on mitigation plans to make up for any expected production loss.‚Äù He further informed that all factories in China will reopen on February 10 in some of the impact areas instead of January end.

Foxconn in a latest report said that it is working to meet all manufacturing obligations amid the coronavirus outbreak in China. Foxconn in a statement said, ‚ÄúWe do not comment on our specific production practices, but we can confirm that we have measures in place to ensure that we can continue to meet all global manufacturing obligations.‚Äù

With contradicting statements coming from everywhere it is difficult to say whether Apple‚Äôs affordable iPhone will launch in March ‚Äî as reported in the past ‚Äî or will be delayed further.

Google‚Äôs factories in China shut

Alongside Apple, Coronavirus is affecting Google as well. The company has confirmed to The Verge that due to Coronavirus outbreak all Google offices in China will be temporarily shut until further notified. Google has also confirmed to shut its offices temporarily in Hong Kong and Taiwan, which is likely to impact Google‚Äôs production.

Non-China based employees currently in that country are required to return to their home countries immediately.‚Äù It further noted, ‚ÄúIf travel to China is absolutely essential, employees are required to request and receive special approval in advance. We are confident that the disease can be contained if everyone ‚Äî including corporations doing business in China ‚Äî is prudent and makes the safety of their employees their number one priority.‚Äù
