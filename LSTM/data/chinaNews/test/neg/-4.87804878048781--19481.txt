A deadly SARS-like virus infected hundreds of people and claimed the lives of three people.

Australians have been told to reconsider travelling to Wuhan as the Chinese city battles to contain the deadly coronavirus outbreak.

Advice on the government’s SmartTraveller website has been updated to reflect the gravity of what the World Health Organisation has called a complex and evolving situation.

“We now advise all Australians to reconsider their need to travel to Wuhan,” the website warns.

“The Chinese authorities have put new measures in place to contain the spread of the coronavirus.

“This includes wearing masks in public places and avoiding travel in and out of Wuhan. Monitor local media for further updates.” The website says anyone in Australia who’s developed symptoms of respiratory illness after recently going to Wuhan should immediately see their doctor. The website’s previous advice was that Australians bound for Wuhan should exercise a high degree of caution.

Wuhan is now in lock down, with transport networks shut and citizens told not to leave the city after the virus surfaced. It’s suspected to have originated from illegally traded wildlife and is now being passed from person to person. The flu-like virus has so far killed 17 people and infected more than 540, with cases surfacing in the US, Japan, South Korea and Thailand.

The World Health Organisation will decide on Thursday whether to declare a global emergency, as the deadly virus spreads beyond China.

In Australia, passengers on flights arriving from the city will be screened by health authorities.
