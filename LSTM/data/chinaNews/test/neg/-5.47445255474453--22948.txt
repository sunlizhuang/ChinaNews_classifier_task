In the days leading up to the Lunar New Year, cities and businesses across China have canceled their celebrations or temporarily closed due to the spread of coronavirus and airports around the world are taking precautions.The disease has killed at least 25 people and infected at least 800, including two people in the United States.

On Friday a second U.S.-based case of coronavirus was detected in Chicago, according to USA Today. The victim is a 60-year-old woman who is currently being hospitalized in isolation and is "clinically doing well and in stable condition." She returned from Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak, on Jan. 13. The first stateside case of the virus was reported in Washington state.

The World Health Organization (WHO) decided against calling the outbreak a global emergency but the director-general clarified on Twitter: “Make no mistake. This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency.”

The U.S. has also released a "Do Not Travel" advisory to Wuhan to protect citizens against the virus where the symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. USA Today noted that in more severe cases, infection can cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death.

Multiple cities in China have closed off their transportation systems to contain the disease and tourist attractions are closing to the public. As of Friday, 13 cities surrounding Wuhan are halting transportation which has resulted in restricting 33 million people from traveling, NBC News reported.
