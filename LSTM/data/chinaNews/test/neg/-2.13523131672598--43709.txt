The Allen County Health Department on Friday joined U.S. and international authorities in warning against the new strain of coronavirus.

On Thursday, the State Department banned travel to China by U.S. residents, and the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern because of the rapidly spreading outbreak.

Dr. Deborah McMahan, county health commissioner, said in a statement that people traveling internationally should consult their physicians or the health department for recommendations.

“We are very aware of the international travel that begins in Fort Wayne,” she said.

Although no vaccine exists for the new strain , the health department has sent a letter to local businesses alerting them to its travel-immunization clinic that provides recommended vaccines at cost plus an administrative fee.

There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Allen County, and federal officials consider it a low risk for the general population.

But the virus, identified in Wuhan, China, has spread to thousands there and has shown up in several countries, with seven confirmed cases in the United States. More than 200 people have died.

A sixth U.S. case, in Chicago, became the first documented U.S. case of person-to-person transmission, health officials announced Thursday.

A woman, believed in her 60s, tested positive for the virus after returning from Wuhan in mid-January and was hospitalized. Her husband, who had been in close contact with her, also tested positive.

Also this week, a patient traveling through northwest Indiana was hospitalized in Porter County in a suspected case of coronavirus, health officials said.

The patient was put in isolation as a precaution pending test results.
