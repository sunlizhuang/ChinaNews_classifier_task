A total of 42 visitors from China arrived on Guam Saturday afternoon and early Monday morning, just ahead of a new coronavirus-related federal travel ban which took effect 8 a.m. Monday.

Airport General Manager Tom Ada said 19 arrived on Guam Saturday, starting in China and transiting through Japan or South Korea. Another 24 Chinese visitors arrived early Monday morning, he said, also transiting through Japan and South Korea. According to the Department of Public Health and Social Services, one of the passenger names was duplicated, so the actual count is only 42.

Ada said Public Health was called to the airport to screen those passengers, who were allowed to enter Guam because they had no virus symptoms. Public Health Director Linda DeNorcey, on Monday morning told radio host Patty Arroyo those passengers were instructed to call Public Health officials if they start feeling ill. DeNorcey said if they have symptoms of the virus they will be isolated.

Under the new travel ban, those passengers from China would have temporarily been denied access to Guam, which is U.S. soil. Most of Guam's tourists are from South Korea and Japan, with Chinese travelers representing only 1 percent of arrivals last fiscal year.

The airlines are primarily responsible for enforcing the federal ban, by screening passengers and prohibiting banned passengers from boarding the plane, Ada said. That means Guam’s airport should not be receiving any banned passengers, provided the airlines have screened them, he said.

Here are the travel restrictions which took effect nationwide Monday morning:

Any U.S. citizen returning to the U.S. who has been in Hubei province in China in the past 14 days will be subject to a 14-day mandatory quarantine.

Any U.S. citizen returning to the U.S. who has traveled to the rest of mainland China within the past 14 days will undergo a proactive health screening at a select number of ports. They’ll be subject to 14 days of monitored self-quarantine to ensure they haven’t contracted the virus.

Foreign nationals who traveled to China within the last 14 days will be temporarily denied entry into the U.S.

Entry into the U.S. will also be temporarily suspended for foreign nationals who pose a risk of transmitting the coronavirus.

Guam’s airport is not one of the seven airports identified to screen U.S. citizens who recently have been to China. The Honolulu airport is one of the seven.

Guam customs officials also are conducting “passive” screening of arriving passengers, to identify those who might be ill, he said.

Ada said the Guam Visitors Bureau is trying to procure a thermal scanner for the airport in order to more easily identify arriving passengers who have a fever. Good hygiene is the best defense, Ada said, and the airport also plans to provide hand sanitizers at the facility. They have not yet been procured, he said.

The government of Guam is preparing plans in case anyone needs to be quarantined locally, according to Public Health.

“We are in constant communication with federal public health officials and our White House counterparts," Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero said. "We are prepared to execute all official advisories once they are issued, and we will advise the public accordingly. We have planned for these circumstances and we are ready to implement our plan and keep Guam safe."
