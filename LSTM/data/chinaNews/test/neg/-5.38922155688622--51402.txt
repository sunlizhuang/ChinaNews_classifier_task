Coronavirus: China passes 20,000 cases, as second death outside the country is recorded in Hong Kong

Two cases have been reported in the UK so far

The number of coronavirus cases in China has exceeded 20,000, with more than 420 deaths recorded on Tuesday, up from 64 a day earlier.

The total number of infections soared from 3,235 to 20,438 in just 24 hours, the National Health Commission said, while there are at least 151 cases in 23 countries outside China including the UK, the US, Japan, and Thailand.

China said it would welcome assistance from the United States in fighting the coronavirus outbreak, though did so a day after accusing Washington of scaremongering after its decision to bar foreigners who recently visited China from entering the US, as the virus spreads around the world.

The city of Wuhan, in central China, and the surrounding province of Hubei make up the centre of the epidemic and are both under a virtual quarantine from the rest of the country.

On Sunday, the first death outside of China was reported. A 44-year-old Chinese man died in the Philippines after travelling there from Wuhan.

Today, a second death outside China - or at least outside the mainland - was recorded, as a 39-year-old man from Wuhan died in Hong Kong. Authorities said he had existing health problems.

As well as the US, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand, and Vietnam are among countries that have denied entry to foreign nationals who have recently visited the country.

Two cases have been reported in the UK and have been receiving treatment. A number of evacuees entering the country were sent straight to quarantine as Britain steps up its defences and looks to prevent the spread.

Citizens evacuated

Global airlines, meanwhile, have suspended or scaled back direct flights to Chinaâ€™s major cities, while businesses including German fashion house Hugo Boss and the Swiss watch producer Swatch have cancelled shows and closed some stores in the country.

The outbreak has also been damaging China's economy. Its central bank has injected 1.2 trillion yuan ($174 billion) worth of liquidity into money markets after promising to help companies struggling due to the virus.

Asian share prices improved on Tuesday as investors waited anxiously to see if Beijing could stem the rout in Chinese assets, which saw $393 billion wiped off share values a day earlier, Reuters has reported.

Countries including Russia, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and the United States are working to evacuate citizens from Wuhan or have already done so.
