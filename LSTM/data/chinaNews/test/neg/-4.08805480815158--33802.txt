Another suspected coronavirus case is under investigation in WA, Health Minister Roger Cook has revealed.

News of the possible infection comes as the State Government has stepped up its advise from schools to anyone who has returned from Hubei Province and issued a plea to all people to self isolate.

On Wednesday afternoon, Mr Cook said the case was “very current” and that the adult patient had presented to a WA hospital.

“It’s a very recent case. I mean I’ve just heard that walking in today,” he said.

“At this stage, it’s a patient that has presented with a range of respiratory symptoms. As a result of that we are undertaking the tests. I can’t provide any further details.”

He couldn’t reveal where the patient had presented or if family of the suspected case was in isolation.

When quizzed if flights from China and Hong Kong would be suspended after British Airways revealed it would be the first international carrier to cut services to and from the region, Mr Cook said the decision laid in the hands of the Federal Government.

In the meantime, Mr Cook said WA would be taking all “abundantly cautious measures” possible to stop the spread for the disease that has claimed the lives of at least 130 people, with nearly 6000 confirmed cases.

“We are asking everyone who has returned from Hubei Province within the last 14 days to self isolate, stay at home, unless you are seeking medical attention,” he said.

“For many of these people the clock is ticking. They might have already have been home for 10 days and so we’re asking them just to stay at home for a few more days.

“We are doing it because we want to make sure we absolutely keep everyone as safe as possible.

“We have asked the public sector commission to issue instructions to all public sector workers who fit within that category to stay away from work.

We are asking everyone who has returned from Hubei Province within the last 14 days to self isolate, stay at home, unless you are seeking medical attention.

“This is in addition to the request we made yesterday which is for all school children who have travelled from mainland China or Hong Kong within the last 14 days to also stay at home and not attend school.”

On Tuesday afternoon, a coronavirus hotline had been set up for WA, however, its demand is still unclear.

People who believe they have coronavirus, been in contact with someone who may be affected or have general enquiries can call 1800 300 243.

A WA laboratory will also be established across the next two days through PathWest to test any possible coronavirus infections.

Currently, samples have had to be transferred to the eastern states. Mr Cook said the move would quicken the process of testing.

Earlier today, it was revealed that Christmas Island would become a Coronavirus epicentre evacuation more than 600 Australian citizens stranded in the Chinese province of Hubei, including the capital of Wuhan where the outbreak occurred.

It’s understood those stranded may have to foot some of the travel bill to the quarantine site.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison spoke to the plan on Wednesday, claiming the evacuation proposal was still in its infancy.

“This will be done subject obviously to working closely and with the authority and approval of the Chinese government,” he said.

“I stress there is rather a limited window here and we are moving very, very swiftly to ensure we can put this plan together and put the operation together.”

The State’s chief health officer Andrew Roberson said it was too early to tell if health works from WA would travel to Christmas Island to care for people who may be quarantined there.

“We’re still waiting to hear from the Commonwealth Government to hear what they are planning to do but it is likely that there will be people from all of the jurisdictions who may make up the team that will support those people in that area,” he said.

“There has been a request for staff for a Australian medical assistance team to provide support in Christmas Island and obviously may nominate people to be a part of that.”

He said WA authorities had received no indication on when they first flight from Wuhan would arrive but that the main focus would be on infection control.

“We have no further details on when or how they will be transported back or what the timing of that will be,” he said.

He labelled the risk to residents on Christmas Island as “minimal”.

“I think they will be kept in a certain area and that will be controlled but again the operational details of that… currently sit with the Australian government. We’re still finalising the plans.”

Mr Roberson said he couldn’t comment on whether flights should to and from China and Hong Kong should be suspended.

“I think that’s a decision for probably both the Australian Government and probably the Chinese Government. The Chinese Government has obviously already made a number of moves to restrict travel within China from areas of concern but it’s certainly a decision for the Australian Government. It’s very difficult to get out of Wuhan at the moment because of the restriction on all travel out of that province.”

British Airways announced it had suspended all direct flights to mainland China as the number of people killed by the deadly coronavirus climbed to 132.

Bookings to Beijing and Shanghai were suspended on the British Airways website until February 3 following the UK Government’s warnings against travel to China.

The site now shows no direct services to the two major cities available until March, with a spokesperson telling media the airline was “urgently assessing the situation”.

Meanwhile, Virgin Australia – who does not operate direct flights to mainland China – has revealed Virgin guests travelling to, from or via the mainland will be offered refunds or have their change fees waived should they want to change their booking.

“We are closely following all advice received from Australian medical authorities, as well as the World Health Organisation, regarding precautions that are needed to minimise risks concerned with the 2019 novel coronavirus. We are regularly reviewing the information provided to us from health authorities and will update procedures as needed,” a spokesperson said.

On Tuesday the UK’s Foreign Office warned Britons against “all but essential” travel to mainland China due to the coronavirus outbreak.

As the infections continue to spread, airports across the world are ramping up their biosecurity, with an additional 15 US airports (up from five) yesterday beginning the screening of passengers flying in from China. The White House is still deciding if US flights to China should be suspended.

Yesterday Japan, the US and Turkey evacuated hundreds of its citizens from Wuhan, where the outbreak started, while last night the UK Government was finalising plans to follow suit. At the centre of the outbreak, China’s Hubei province had recorded 125 deaths and 3554 confirmed cases.

Officials from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are studying the disease in an effort to stop an outbreak in the US as well as develop measures to tackle the virus.
