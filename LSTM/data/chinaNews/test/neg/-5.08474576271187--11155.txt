A woman lived with incontinence for more than three decades before learning she had an extra kidney which constantly leaked urine through her vagina.

The unnamed female patient, 36, was treated at Chuxiong People's Hospital in China 's south-western province of Yunnan, where a thorough examination revealed that her third kidney had suffered a congenital malformation which sent her urine into her reproductive tract instead of her bladder.

Doctor Li Guotai told local media: "The woman has a duplex right kidney and a duplex ureter.

"But the extra duct did not lead to her bladder, instead opening in her vagina.

"She didn't urinate like a normal person; her urine would flow out of her vagina.

"Her condition worsened after she had her first child. Her urine would leak uncontrollably, especially in the mornings.

"She would use four to five sanitary pads a day, sometimes up to six."

Duplex kidney, also known as renal duplication, reportedly occurs in 1 percent of all patients, but it often goes undiagnosed if the kidney functions as normal.

Doctor Li scheduled an operation for the patient, who underwent ureteral reimplantation microsurgery to redirect her malformed duct back into her bladder on 11th January, solving her life-long medical woes.

The patient said: "I was in such agony. I had to wear a sanitary pad at all times.

"I always wanted a cure for my condition, but no other treatment worked.

"My urine stopped leaking immediately after the surgery."

According to the hospital, the patient was well enough to walk around the day after her surgery.

She is expected to make a full recovery.
