China on Monday urged the United States to stop wrongfully imposing unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction on Chinese enterprises by enacting its own domestic laws.

The U.S. imposed sanctions against six Chinese firms, three Russian companies, one Iraqi company and one Turkey firm in accordance with The Iran, North Korea (DPRK), and Syria Nonproliferation Act, a document published in the Federal Register revealed on Friday.

Geng Shuang, the spokesperson of Chinese foreign ministry during the online press said that the Chinese side has lodged serious representations on this matter.

He noted that China has always been committed to strengthening the international nonproliferation system, strictly fulfilling its international nonproliferation obligations, and maintaining exchanges and cooperation with all parties on the basis of mutual respect.

The spokesperson pointed out that the U.S. on the other hand, is addicted to unilateralism in the field of non-proliferation and is prone to implement unilateral sanctions and so-called "long arm jurisdiction".

These actions seriously damage the interests of other countries and undermine international efforts to solve the nuclear non-proliferation problem and maintain international and regional peace, which are generally opposed by the international community, he added.

Geng also pointed out that the Iranian nuclear issue is a typical example, adding that China urged the U.S. side to face the concerns of the international community and earnestly respect the legitimate rights and interests of all countries.
