Joseph Elledge was charged with first-degree murder Wednesday in the death of his wife

The American husband of a Chinese woman has been charged with first-degree murder in her death, even though her body hasn't been found more than four months after she vanished.

Joseph Elledge did not report his 28-year-old wife Mengqi Ji missing for more than 36 hours after she was last seen at their Columbia, Missouri home on the evening of October 8 and prosecutors say in the hours after he visited rural areas where he could have disposed of a body.

Ji's parents said they had been trying to get in touch with Elledge and his mother since October 8 when their daughter stopped responding to them. They usually had daily conversations on the phone.

Elledge says he last saw his wife around 11.30pm on October 8. He had given her a massage with her lying on her stomach and him on her back. A probable cause statement filed Wednesday suggested he may have intentionally strangled or suffocated her.

Authorities have found no blood from the victim in Elledge's home or vehicle but note the methods of killing are 'relatively bloodless, silent'.

Elledge claims on October 9 he woke up and found her gone. He spent time playing video games and contacted his mother and a friend without mentioning that she was missing, even though her disappearance was unusual, according to a statement.

He didn't mention he didn't know where she was until one of her friends came to the house the next day at the request of her parents.

At that point, he put his wife's mother on a video call and told her Ji was missing and then began contacting her friends to see if they knew where she was. None of her family or friends have had contact with Ji since she went missing and there has been no activity on her financial accounts.

During the hours after his wife disappeared, Elledge took two drives with the couple's one-year-old daughter to rural areas and to a popular biking and hiking trail with access to the Lamine River near Boonville. 'These locations are places where a body could be disposed of an not located for some time,' the statement says.

Elledge visited rural areas where he could dispose of a body in the hours after his wife vanished. Authorities have been searching for Ji's body in the Lamine River near Boonville. Two police cadaver dogs alerted to the presence of human decomposition in the river

Two police cadaver dogs later alerted to the presence of human decomposition in the river. The area has been searched several times with different methods but the 'complicated nature' of the area has prevented a comprehensive search.

While in the rural areas, Elledge did not leave a note for his wife, locked the door and took her apartment key when he left their home. 'Joseph did not have any plans for if Mengqi returned while he was gone,' the statement says.

Elledge's cell phone records show he drove to that river for about 45 minutes in the hours after his wife went missing, the statement says.

On October 10 he reported her missing. The next day his mother Jean Elledge finally returned calls to Ji's parents claiming her phone app had been off for two days.

Ji received a master's degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering from the University of Missouri in December 2014. She previously attended the East China University of Science and Technology in Shanghai.

Her mother told police Elledge was a controlling husband who would not allow Ji to have a social life and would get upset if she left the house for trips that he thought were too long.

Elledge was quickly was named as the prime suspect in her disappearance and was already charged with child endangerment and abuse of a child.

Her mother told police Elledge was a controlling, wouldn't allow Ji to have a social life and would get upset if she left the house for trips that were too long. But he didn't mention the unusual disappearance in a conversation with his mother within the first 24 hours

Recordings of conversations between the couple before Ji disappeared showed him to be 'openly hostile and at times threatening to Ji.' At one point in June 2019 he said 'I'm ready to be done talking to you forever' and in August said he wanted a divorce

He was arrested October 25 while attempting to leave Columbia with his child and his mother, Jean Elledge. Jean claimed they were preparing to spend the weekend in Blue Springs where she has a home. He was jailed on $500,000 bond.

During the months Ji has been missing, authorities learned the couple's relationship had broken down after he allegedly beat their daughter. His wife took pictures and video of her injuries at the time but decided against going to the police at the time.

After she went missing, someone reported the abuse and he was arrested.

Their toddler's maternal grandparents and paternal grandparents now share custody after a hearing in November.

In the probable cause statement, detectives were advised that Joseph Elledge abused the toddler by striking her on the buttocks hard enough to cause severe bruising in February.

The girl's mother had wanted to contact police but gave Elledge another chance after he promised he would never do it again. She sent another person a picture of the bruising, however, and officers examining the mother's iPad located pictures and videos of the bruising.

The affidavit said Joseph Elledge told officers that he did bruise the girl months earlier, saying initially that he did not know how it happened. He later told officers the girl was crying and would not stop. The bruising may have been caused by pinching the girl to distract her or by holding her too hard, Elledge told police.

But authorities said the yellow, purple and blue bruising resembled a strike.

After the parents flew to Missouri and filed for custody, a statement from November read that 'they are confused by Jean Elledge's actions' after she avoided them and then tried to gain custody of the child.

'Jean Elledge continues to withhold information from Mengqi's parents and failed to inform them of the pending case for guardianship of their granddaughter,' the statement said.

Prosecutors said Elledge separated his wife from their one-year-old daughter and that the separation created 'a substantial risk' to the girl.

In November he also became the prime suspect in Ji's disappearance.

Columbia police spokesman Steven Sapp said previously that police learned the couple had been having problems when Joseph Elledge divulged that during an on-camera interview with KRCG-TV. In the interview, Elledge described his wife as a doting mother but said 'we were growing kind of distant in the past few months.'

Recordings of conversations between the couple before Ji disappeared showed him to be 'openly hostile and at times threatening to Ji.' At one point in June 2019 he said 'I'm ready to be done talking to you forever' and in August said he wanted a divorce, according to the statement.

In one of four audio tapes played in court of the couple arguing, the University of Missouri student was heard saying he wanted a divorce 'the sooner the better.'

In the recordings, Joseph Elledge can be heard saying 'I don't like being with you,' 'I'm eager to end it' and 'I will bury the earth under you.'

Mengqi Ji Elledge can also be heard arguing with her husband, who raised his voice several times. At one point, he told her, 'I know you want me to hit you,' and, 'This, it's not abusive.'

Boone County Chief Prosecutor Dan Knight said during a hearing that Elledge is a 'jealous, controlling, manipulative psychopath,' the Columbia Missourian reported.

The defense, meanwhile, argued that Joseph Elledge's bond should be reduced, saying that Mengqi Ji Elledge had exchanged sexually explicit messages with another person. Little else was said during the hearing about the messages.

A police detective clarified that officers hadn't yet gone through Mengqi Ji's phone, which police found along with her wallet, laptop and passport in the couple's apartment after her disappearance.

Mid-November Elledge still hadn't been charged and as deer firearm season began police warned hunters to remain vigilant while out in rural areas.

Early December police temporarily called off the search for Ji.

After the murder charges, Amy Salladay, the attorney for Ji's family, said the family was 'very supportive' of Boone County Prosecutor Dan Knight's decision to file charges now rather than wait until her body is found.

'I spent a lot of time with the family yesterday. They are very supportive of Dan Knight's decision to file these charges. They understand the risks associated with double jeopardy but they also need resolution for their granddaughter and they have full confidence that Mr. Knight has carefully considered all factors related to filing the case now,' Salladay said.

Salladay said Ji's family appreciates the Columbia police search efforts so far, but are concerned there is no clear plan for further search efforts. She said the family would prefer a multi-disciplinary team working together and taking advantage of all the professional volunteers who have offered their help.

'While they appreciate the search efforts made so far by the Columbia Police Department they remain concerned that no clear plan for continued search efforts have been articulated to them by the police department,' Salladay continued.

'They would like to see the Columbia Police Department collaborating with a multidisciplinary law enforcement team from across several agencies and taking advantage of all of the volunteers who have offered assistance in this matter.

'They believe that if the Columbia Police Department would take advantage of all of the professional volunteers who have offered assistance that the financial burden to the county would be reduced and that resolution could be had.'

Prosecutors have requested a $5 million cash-only bond for Elledge.

His child abuse trial is scheduled for February 25.

An after hours call to Elledge's attorneys' office seeking comment was not immediately returned.
