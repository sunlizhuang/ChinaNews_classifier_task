ISLAMABAD: Renewing her criticism of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), senior US diplomat Alice Wells has claimed that Chinese financing was adding to Pakistan’s debt burden and Islamabad should rethink its involvement with the project, local newspapers reported on Wednesday. China was quick to reject Wells’ remarks, saying “they were nothing new”.Speaking at a think-tank event in Islamabad on Tuesday, principal deputy assistant secretary Wells severely criticised China’s flagship project ‘One Belt One Road Initiative’, which CPEC is a part of. Addressing academicians and representatives of civil society, Wells said there was no transparency in CPEC projects and claimed that Pakistan’s debt burden was growing due to Chinese financing.According to Wells, Chinese money was not assistance. “By getting Chinese financing for the projects, Pakistan was buying expensive loans and, as a buyer, it needed to be aware of what it was doing as this would take a heavy toll on its already struggling economy,” she was quoted by Dawn as saying.She had voiced almost similar concerns in a speech delivered at the Wilson Centre in Washington in November 2019. According to the US diplomat, companies blacklisted by the World Bank had got contracts in CPEC.She also questioned the immunity from prosecution of the CPEC Authority that served as the focal body working to identify new areas of cooperation and projects, besides facilitation, coordination and monitoring of the ongoing ones. The high-level authority, with the highest autonomy and powers, was established last year in October to get expected results out of CPEC.The diplomat also spoke about the cost escalation in railways’ ML-1 (main line) project connecting the southern port city of Karachi with Peshawar in the northwest. She urged the government to be transparent about the mega project.Ambassador Wells’ visit to Islamabad was part of a 10-day regional tour that had already taken her to Sri Lanka and India. Wells arrived in Islamabad on Sunday on a four-day visit. A couple of days before Wells’ arrival here, Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi had visited the US, where he held talks with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and national security advisor Robert O’Brien. During her stay in Islamabad, Wells also discussed with senior government officials issues related to bilateral and regional concerns.Reacting to Wells’ remarks on CPEC, the Chinese embassy here said the comments were nothing new but repetition of her November, 2019, speech, which had been repeatedly rejected by China and Pakistan. “Whether the CPEC works, the answer should be given by the Pakistani people rather than the US,” read a Chinese embassy statement.“We would be more than glad to see the US develop its relationship with Pakistan, but we strongly oppose US interference in China-Pakistan relations and CPEC,” the statement said.“Although you can never wake up a person who is pretending to be asleep, we have to make our position clear and reject the negative propaganda by the US. We must not let the truth be distorted and the lies run wild,” it said.
