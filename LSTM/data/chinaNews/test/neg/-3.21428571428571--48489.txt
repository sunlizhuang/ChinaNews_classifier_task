There will be no layovers for Singapore Airlines (SIA) pilots and cabin crew on flights to Beijing and Shanghai.

This means they have to return to Singapore as soon as possible instead of staying overnight.

The new measure, scheduled to start from 7.30am today, comes amid growing concern about the spread of the Wuhan virus, reported The Straits Times.

SIA operates 21 flights weekly to Beijing and 28 per week to Shanghai as of this month.

An SIA spokesman told The Straits Times yesterday that operating them as turnaround flights is "a precautionary measure for the safety of our crew".
