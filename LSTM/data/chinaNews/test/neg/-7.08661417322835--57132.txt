As the Coronavirus poises to go global, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s General Directorate of Passports has banned citizens and expatriates from travelling to China.

The Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reports regulatory provisions on travel documents would be applied to citizens who violate the travel ban.

“In the event that one of the expatriates violates the travel suspension to China, he/she will not be allowed to return to the Kingdom.”

Saudi Arabian Airlines has already joined other major airlines in suspending flights to China.

The disease has so far killed 565 people, mostly in China, and infected more than 28,000 people in over 25 countries and territories.
