THE government must do its best to protect the health and safety of Malaysians from any deadly and contagious disease, including the one caused by the new coronavirus afflicting people all over the world.

Coronavirus is a family of pathogens that causes diseases in mammals and birds, including diarrhea in cows and pigs, and upper respiratory disease in chickens. In humans, the virus causes respiratory infections, which are often mild, but in rare cases are lethal. There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs that are approved for prevention or treatment. In recent weeks, such a virus has attacked hundreds of people as well bring death to dozens of people. The worst affected country is China, where the virus believed to have been originated from. Many countries have also reported cases of the deadly and contagious virus, like South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Australia, France and Malaysia. Since such a virus is very deadly and contagious to people, steps must be taken by everybody to ensure infections are under control and can be eliminated.

The government especially the Health Ministry must work with all relevant agencies, like the Immigration Department, to monitor every person entering the country. Our country border and entrance must be tightly monitored and controlled at all times so that nobody suspected of carrying the virus enters our country and spreads it to our people. The government must also take bold steps to stop anyone, especially from badly affected country like China, to come to our country temporarily. The government must also temporarily stop the visa exemption given to Chinese tourists. Malaysians must be advised to not travel to China. All these measures must be taken to protect our people from being exposed to such a deadly and contagious virus.

Beside the government, every individual must make their own efforts to protect themselves from the virus. Everybody must observe hygiene at all times. It is important for everybody to know that there is currently no vaccine this new coronavirus. However, they can take steps to reduce their risk of infection like by constantly washing their hand with water and soap, avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, avoid close contact with people who are sick, wear masks when in crowds, and others. Anyone who suffer any sickness must seek medical attention.

Constant awareness must also be carry out by the authorities over such issue to the public in the country. Public in the country must be constantly inform about the latest development over the issue. Public must be inform over steps which need to be taken by them in order to protect themselves from being infected with such deadly and contagious virus. Children in schools must be properly educated on such matters. Everybody’s cooperation is needed if we want to control and eliminate such deadly and contagious diseases more effectively and efficiently. – January 26, 2020.
