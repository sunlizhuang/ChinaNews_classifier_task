Thousands of cruise passengers are reportedly stuck on a ship in Italy amid fears that Chinese holidaymakers are carrying the deadly coronavirus.

Up to 7,000 passengers and crew are thought to be being held on the Costa Smeralda, where a couple from China have reportedly been put in isolation after showing symptoms of the deadly virus.

The vessel is currently dock in Civitavecchia, north-west of Rome.

The news comes as Brits who were hoping to fly home from coronavirus-hit Wuhan were left stuck in China after officials refused permission for their flight to take off.

Passengers shared images of people sitting on floors in public areas on the ship as they waited for information.

One passenger, Filippo, also posted photos of police officers stood on the dock, writing: "Meanwhile in Civitavecchia we are stuck in Costa ship without knowing the reason (officially)."

Another passenger, Maria Cartagena, tweeted: "#costasmeralda#coronavirus Does anyone know how long it takes for tests to detect it?

"They are doing checks on 2 Chinese passengers and for now (logical) they don't tell us anything else. A bit of burden ..."

Italian media reported that authorities fear that if the Chinese couple are found to have coronavirus, it could already have spread to hundreds of people on board the ship.

The Costa Smeralda arrived in Civitavecchia from Palma de Mallorca and was due to arrive in La Spezia in Italy on Friday.

According to reports, the couple have already been tested for coronavirus.

It is possible that other passengers will now have to undergo medical screening.

Ernesto Tedesco, mayor of Civitavecchia, told TRC Giornale: "There is a suspected case of coronavirus at the port of Civitavecchia."

Over 200 passengers were on the chartered flight - that was used to evacuate Japanese nationals from Wuhan. Several countries including the US have begun flying their citizens out of the epicentre of the epidemic, which China has put on virtual lockdown. Chinese officials say the death toll has climbed to 170 - and on top of the nearly 8 thousand confirmed cases - there's an additional 12 thousand suspected cases of the virus. Japan's health ministry on Thursday (January 30) confirmed its three new cases. And said two weren't showing any symptoms when they tested positive for the virus. One of the major unknowns at the moment is whether people can be contagious before they even realise they're sick - which could make quarantine too late. Governments and companies worldwide are taking drastic measures to combat the previously unknown coronavirus. Sweden's Ikea announced Thursday it's temporarily closing all its stores in China. That follows similar steps by other big international chains - with some closing up to half their shops there. Companies around the world are warning of a financial hit. It's also weighing heavily on the world's second largest economy. One firm warned of a severe near-term blow to China's financial health. (SOUNDBITE) (English) WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION HEALTH EMERGENCIES PROGRAMME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MICHAEL RYAN, SAYING: "…we are at an important juncture in this event" Meanwhile the World Health Organization said on Wednesday they're worried about the progress of the virus. And said the relatively small number of cases outside China hold the potential of a much larger outbreak. The WHO's emergency committee is set to reconvene behind closed doors on Thursday. And decide whether now's the time to call this a global emergency. Hundreds of people wait in a queue to buy surgical masks at a Bonjour Cosmetics store.
