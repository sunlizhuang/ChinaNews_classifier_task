WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is moving swiftly to ensure that China is keeping its promises to protect American intellectual property, ratcheting up searches for counterfeit goods at ports and increasing pressure on e-commerce companies like Amazon to halt online sales of Chinese knockoffs.

The administration’s effort, unveiled on Friday, included a Department of Homeland Security report detailing the extent of the influx of counterfeit products from China and the public health and economic risks they pose to the United States.

The initiative serves as a warning to China, which this month reached a partial trade agreement with the United States, that the administration will aggressively monitor Beijing’s commitments.

The 54-page report includes a series of recommendations and actions that the United States government will take to crack down on certain products coming primarily from China, like fake Louis Vuitton bags and car airbags, as well as illicit drugs including fentanyl, cocaine and ecstasy. Trump administration officials estimate that more than 100,000 packages a day from China contain items that could defraud or harm Americans.
