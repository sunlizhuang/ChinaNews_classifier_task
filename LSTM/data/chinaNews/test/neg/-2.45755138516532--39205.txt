BRITS rescued from coronavirus-hit Wuhan are set to land in the UK in a matter of hours after making a desperate dash to escape the killer virus.

Evacuees will be rushed to a Wirral hospital unit - quarantined for two weeks as authorities frantically work to stop the coronavirus from reaching Britain's shores as its global death toll reaches 213.

The chartered aircraft left Wuhan overnight, carrying 110 passengers including 83 Britons, and is expected to land in the UK at RAF Brize Norton at about 11am.

Last night, many posted selfies at the airport as they were evacuated out of Wuhan, where coronavirus was first reported.

They were wearing face masks in an attempt to stop the deadly droplets.

But some Brits living in the region were left furious after claiming they had been given just two hours' notice to get to the airport.

It comes as the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak a global health emergency on an unprecedented scale.

What we know about coronavirus so far...

Ben Kavanagh was among those who revealed they had made it to the Wuhan airport to get out of the contaminated region.

Mr Kavanagh, a psychology teacher from Kilcullen in Co Kildare, Ireland, was one of the first on board the aircraft and shared a selfie from the empty plane with the caption: "Group selfie of me and my friends."

The teacher also shared footage of himself rushing to the airport to make the flight, later showing him wearing a face mask.

He had been working as a teacher in Wuhan and had lived there for almost two years.

Mr Graham also shared a selfie with the caption: "Been awake for 24 hours... off to an isolation centre somewhere in Merseyside for 14 days. Fair to say 2020 has started with a bang!"

He shared another photo of the deserted Wuhan terminal and said: "He's going home... he's going home. he's going."

After touching down in the UK, evacuees will be bussed to their quarantine accommodation at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral, Merseyside.

Twenty-seven EU citizens are also on the flight and it's expected they'll be dropped off in Spain after the flight lands in Britain.

The global death toll for the virus has now hit 213 with more than 9,000 people affected by the outbreak.

The evacuation flight will have three military medics and Public Health England (PHE) officials on board, but it will be crewed by civilians.

And Brits will then be taken straight to nearby Royal Liverpool Hospital - one of four high consequence infectious diseases treatment centres in England.

Janelle Holmes, chief executive of Wirral University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, sent a message to staff last night, saying: "Around 100 British citizens will be travelling to the UK from China tomorrow.

"As a precaution they will remain in isolation for 14 days following their arrival in the UK.

"We will be welcoming and housing them in the accommodation block at Arrowe Park Hosptial.

"Before arrival they will be screened for symptoms. If anyone becomes unwell after arrival they will be treated following appropriate protocols."

It comes as health bosses confirmed 161 coronavirus tests have been carried out in the UK - all have come back negative.

STRANDED

But some Brits say they'll remain stranded in Wuhan as they were given just two hours to get to the airport, while others have decided to stay because their dual-national relatives have been told they cannot be rescued.

Chris Hill, a 38-year-old British citizen who lives in Wuhan, had to make the difficult decision to refuse a repatriation flight because officials could not confirm whether his wife and four-year-old daughter, Renee, would be allowed to board.

He told the Evening Standard: "I told them immediately, I said 'Oh OK so you cannot confirm in any way that they could travel with me' and they said 'we're trying our best but we can't guarantee anything,' so I said 'No, I'm not going'.

"With the current situation and the way the FCO is handling the diplomatic side of things, I'm just losing faith."

Anthony May-Smith, who had his bags packed for days, told Sky News he had just two hours to get to the meeting point and was not able to make the rescue flight.

He said: "There's a complete transport ban in the city.

"I've said this to them every time I've spoken to them and asked them what they can do to help, and every time, always 'make your own way there'.

"It's literally impossible to get there."

He added: "There’s no cars, there’s no taxis, anything, and the FCO say, ‘Oh we’ll pick you up from Wuhan Tianhe airport but you have to make your own way there’.

"That gives me a very bad taste in my mouth. It's just bad planning."

RESCUED FROM HELL

Officials had been working to secure a flight out of Wuhan for British nationals after one planned for Thursday failed to get clearance from Chinese authorities.

In a statement earlier on Thursday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab confirmed a rescue flight had been given the go-ahead.

He added: "The safety and security of British nationals is our top priority.

"Our Embassy in Beijing and consular teams remain in close contact with British nationals in the region to ensure they have the latest information they need."

Speaking at a Policy Exchange event in Westminster earlier, Mr Raab said officials in the Foreign Office had "been working tirelessly" to get citizens out of Wuhan.

He added: "We've been working with the Department of Health flat out, 24/7, to try and make sure we can identify British nationals in Wuhan, get them to a muster point and get them to a flight, a chartered flight in and out."

Wuhan is currently a ghost town, with many staying indoors as experts warned the deadly bug will become a worldwide pandemic if governments do not impose heavy global travel bans.

And passengers say they have been told only to take hand luggage on the flight.

India confirmed its first case on Thursday, as did the Philippines.

In the UK, 161 people have tested negative for the virus as of Thursday.

Of 1,466 passengers and 95 staff who arrived in the UK from Wuhan between January 10 and 24, some 162 have already left the UK and 760 are now outside the 14-day incubation period for the virus.

Meanwhile, the Government has advised against "all but essential" travel to mainland China due to the coronavirus outbreak.

British Airways has halted all its flights to and from mainland China until Monday.

Virgin Atlantic flights between Heathrow and Shanghai are continuing to operate as scheduled.

Where did coronavirus start? From bats to snakes - the theories on deadly virus' origins The killer coronavirus was spread from bats to snakes to humans, experts have claimed. An outbreak of the virus is understood to have started at an open air fish market in the Chinese city of Wuhan - which has since been put in lockdown after 25 people died and more than 600 people were infected globally. A new study published in the China Science Bulletin this week claimed that the new coronavirus shared a strain of virus found in bats. Previous deadly outbreaks of SARS and Ebola were also believed to have originated in the flying mammal. Experts had thought the new virus wasn't capable of causing an epidemic as serious as those outbreaks because its genes were different. But this latest research appeared to prove otherwise - as scientists scrabble to produce a vaccine. In a statement, the researchers said: “The Wuhan coronavirus’ natural host could be bats … but between bats and humans there may be an unknown intermediate." Meanwhile, scientists at Peking University also claim that the deadly virus was passed to humans from bats - but say it was through a mutation in snakes. The researchers said that the new strain is made up of a combination of one that affects bats and another unknown coronavirus. They believe that combined genetic material from both bats and this unknown strain picked up a protein that allows viruses bind to certain host cells - including those of humans. After analysing the genes of the strains the team found that snakes were susceptible to the most similar version of the coronavirus. It meant that they likely provided a "reservoir" for the viral strain to grow stronger and replicate. Snakes are sold at the Huanan Seafood Market in central Wuhan and may have jumped to other animals before passing to humans, they claim. But a senior researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, who asked not to be named, said the findings should be treated with caution. He told the South China Morning Post: “It is based on calculation by a computer model. “Whether it will match what happens in real life is inconclusive. “The binding protein is important, but it is just one of the many things under investigation. There may be other proteins involved.” The expert believes that the new strain was an RNA virus, meaning that its mutation speed was 100 times faster than that of a DNA virus such as smallpox.

It comes after an apartment-hotel in Yorkshire was put on lockdown on Thursday after a man, believed to be a Chinese national, was taken to hospital after falling ill.

The man, who was a guest at the Staycity Hotel in the centre of York, was taken to hospital by medics on Wednesday night.

Meanwhile, whistleblowers who tried to warn Chinese officials last month about the deadly outbreak in Wuhan's live animal market were arrested for "spreading rumours".

A leading UK expert on China said eight people were held for talking about the coronavirus outbreak on a Chinese messaging service WeChat.

Tests on nine of the first infected Chinese patients revealed the disease spread to humans from an animal sold at Wuhan's Huanan seafood market.

China's market watchdog, agricultural ministry and forestry bureau announced a nationwide temporary ban on the wildlife trade last week.

Any places that breed wildlife should be isolated, and the transportation of wildlife should be banned, said the statement.
