Once a delicacy eaten by Chinese emperors, one of the world's largest freshwater fish just went extinct.

Nicknamed the "water tiger" and "panda of the Yangtze," the Chinese paddlefish is reportedly dead after surviving 150 million years, according to a new study in the Science of The Total Environment.

The paddlefish's extinction is the latest to cause researchers to sound a global alarm bell on the dangers of overfishing and habitat fragmentation.

Researchers conducting a year-long survey of the Yangtze River identified more than 330 fish species but did not find a single specimen of paddlefish, which resembles a swordfish. They also could not locate any of 140 fish species typically found in the river, and most are considered highly endangered, the study said.

Chinese paddlefish populations began to decline drastically in the late 1970s as a result of overfishing and habitat fragmentation, the study said. The fish went functionally extinct (could not reproduce) in 1993 before disappearing completely sometime between 2005 and 2010, the study said. The last live specimen was observed in 2003.

"The delayed extinction of Chinese paddlefish resulted from multiple threats, suggesting that optimizing conservation efforts on endangered Yangtze fauna is urgently needed," the researchers wrote.

Scientists say that two other species native to the river, the reeves shad and the Yangtze River dolphin (or baji), have also gone extinct.

The only living species of paddlefish is the American paddlefish, which inhabits several states in the U.S. but has gone extinct in Michigan and in Canada, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Endangered Species, a global authority on the status of species.

The American paddlefish was once the "most important commercial species" in the Mississippi River Valley, but the population began to decline after 1900, according to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. Only a few southern states still allow the commercial harvest of paddleﬁsh.

"Given that the Chinese paddlefish was one of the two extant species of paddlefishes, loss of such unique and charismatic megafauna representative of freshwater ecosystems is a reprehensible and an irreparable loss," Qiwei Wei, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences and co-author of the study, told Mongabay, a California-based environmental news site.

The IUCN Red List has listed the Chinese paddlefish as "critically endangered" since the 1990s, estimating its population at less than 50 individuals in 2009. The largest Chinese paddlefish recorded was 23 ft long and weighed over several thousand pounds, according to the list.

Even though the fish was listed as a first-class state protected animal in China, the paddlefish was historically overfished for human consumption, according to the Red List. It traveled in schools near the water's surface and was easily captured in nets. Since the animals grew to large sizes and reproduce later in life, the population would take long periods of time to recover from depletion.

Construction on the Yangtze also fragmented the paddlefish's habitat. In 1970, China began building the Gezhouba Dam in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, slicing the population in two. The dam blocked the paddlefish's migration route and prevented adult fish from moving to the upper reaches of the river to spawn, according to the Red List.

"It’s devastating that a part of creation has vanished forever, and the fault lies in our hands," said Sarah Uhlemann, an attorney with the U.S. nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity.

"The paddlefish is one of thousands of animals that will disappear in our lifetime if we don’t recognize the current extinction crisis," she said. "We have to care, we have to act, and we have to stop overfishing and habitat destruction or the world will be a much sadder place for our children."

In an effort to protect biodiversity, China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs last week launched a 10-year fishing ban in more than 300 conservation areas along the Yangtze River.

The ban aims to protect rare species and enhance monitoring over aquatic life in the Yangtze, Vice Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Yu Kangzhen told China Daily.

China isn't the only nation at risk of losing its biodiversity. An explosive United Nations report released this past May found that up to a million species are at risk of extinction because of human activities. About 66% of the global marine environment has been significantly altered by humans, and more than a third of all marine mammals are threatened, the report said.

Overfishing is a big part of that problem. As of 2015, 33% of marine fish stocks were being harvested at unsustainable levels, while just 7% were being harvested at levels lower than what can be sustainably fished, the report said. Researchers recommended implementing fishing quotas, protecting marine areas, working closely with producers and consumers and more.

"Between overfishing, pollution, habitat loss and the multiple impacts of climate change on ocean ecosystems, the ocean has never faced such a diverse range of threats," the United Nations said in a press release Wednesday, announcing an Ocean Innovation Challenge to fund projects that restore and protect the oceans.
