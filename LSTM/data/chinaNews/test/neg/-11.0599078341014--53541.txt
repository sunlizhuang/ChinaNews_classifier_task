The death toll from the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has crossed 490 in China, according to the country's National Health Commission. The total death toll from the Wuhan coronavirus has now exceeded the number of deaths in the mainland reported during the 2002-03 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak.

Countries outside China have also reported cases, with only Hong Kong and the Philippines reporting a single death from the disease. Governments of many countries are issuing advisories and setting up screening and quarantine facilities to control the outbreak. People travelling to and from China are being screened and monitored round the clock. The Indian government on Tuesday banned all India-bound airlines from boarding any passengers from China and cancelled all existing Indian visas, in view of the rapid spread of the virus.

As the virus continues to spread across cities in China and other countries, fear has gripped the world. Social media is abuzz with updates and bizarre recommendations about cure and prevention. Although it has not turned into full-blown mass hysteria, some people are deliberately creating panic by spreading false and unverified news.

However, the most outrageous coronavirus claim has been reported from a Jamaica-bound plane in Canada. According to reports, the plane was forced to return to Toronto after a passenger falsely claimed he had coronavirus.

The WestJet Airlines plane had travelled halfway when the pilot was forced to turn it around. Upon landing, a medical team checked the man and determined he did not have the deadly ailment. He was later arrested by the police, reported Toronto’s City News.

The man, identified as 28-year-old James Potok, said his actions inside the plane were intended to be a prank. Shockingly, he had also filmed the moment, hoping it would go viral on social media.

Potok was charged with mischief and breach of recognizance. He will be produced in court on March 9. Following the arrest, Potok apologised for not understanding the seriousness of the epidemic.

“Very, very sorry for my ignorance and not understanding that its an epidemic,” Potok told City News.
