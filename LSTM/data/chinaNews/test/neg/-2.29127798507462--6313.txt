ABUJA, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Four Chinese nationals abducted by pirates during a late December attack in waters off Owendo port in Libreville, Gabon's capital were rescued recently in Nigeria, the Chinese Consulate to Lagos confirmed on Sunday.

An official from the consulate told Xinhua the consulate has been working closely with Nigerian police and navy in the rescue efforts since the consulate was aware that the four Chinese nationals had been taken to Nigeria.

The four Chinese nationals were rescued safe and sound on Thursday and departed for China on Sunday, the official said.

Four Chinese nationals working for the fishing company Sigapeche were abducted by pirates who robbed two company vessels in waters off Owendo port in Gabon's capital on December 22.
