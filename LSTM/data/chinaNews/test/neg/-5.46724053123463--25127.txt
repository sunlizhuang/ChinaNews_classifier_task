Wesleyan University monitoring a student with possible coronavirus symptoms

While concerns continue to mount that the deadly coronavirus has spread to Connecticut, a spokesman for the state department of health said there are no confirmed cases here.

“We have been monitoring a situation at Wesleyan University but as of today we have no confirmed cases in Connecticut,” said Av Harris, director of communication for the state Department of Public Health.

Lauren Rubenstein, the director of media and public relations at Wesleyan, said Saturday the student who recently traveled in Asia and is suffering from a fever and a cough is in isolation.

“We are providing health care and other services,” Rubenstein said Saturday. “No diagnosis (of coronavirus) has been made. Out of an abundance of caution, we are working with the state Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control to determine if the student ... has contracted the coronavirus or not.”

Meanwhile the university has reached out to others who may have come into close contact with the student on campus, Rubenstein said. “To date, none of these individuals have exhibited symptoms of concern,” she said.

Harris said his office, working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will conduct surveillance and facilitate testing for individuals who may be at risk of infection. Up-to-date information can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html

The virus has been responsible for at least 41 deaths in China. There have been two confirmed cases in the U.S. involving a woman in Chicago and a man in Washington state. Both involved individuals who recently returned from Wuhan, China. Other infections have been confirmed in Australia, France, South Korea, Japan, Nepal, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and Taiwan.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people and others that circulate among animals, including camels, cats and bats. It spreads among humans through coughing and sneezing. Laboratory tests are needed to confirm diagnosis. Symptoms can occur as quickly as two days to two weeks.

Harris said symptoms are similar to those ranging from the common cold to the flu. They include headache, coughs, runny nose, sore throat, fever and a general feeling of malaise. There is no vaccine and no approved drugs to fight the disease.

Doctors recommend drinking plenty of fluids and resting. In extreme cases a ventilator may be used to push oxygen into the lungs. diagnosis involves laboratory tests.
