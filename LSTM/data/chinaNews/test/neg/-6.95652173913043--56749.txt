ISOLATION "pods" are to be set up in every NHS hospital in England to deal with suspected coronavirus patients.

Staff were told to create "priority assessment pods" to keep those who fear they could be infected away from other patients.

It comes as the death toll from the deadly virus hit 563 with more than than 28,000 cases worldwide.

A letter, from Professor Keith Willett, NHS strategic incident director for coronavirus, said plans were needed to avoid a "surge in emergency departments due to coronavirus".

Patients who think they have symptoms will be directed to a pod away from A&E, from where they can call specialist NHS 111 teams on a dedicated phone.

An assessment will be made by NHS 111 and A&E staff told of the patient's location if further testing is deemed necessary.

The idea is to keep people isolated and away from other patients until an assessment is made.

Decontaminated

The letter, revealed by The Independent, says the pods will then need to be decontaminated each time they are used.

It warns that emergency departments must prepare for a bigger influx of patients.

The letter also instructs all chief executives and medical directors to have the pods up and running no later than Friday February 7.

An NHS spokesperson said: "Anyone returning from Hubei province in the last 14 days should stay indoors, avoid contact with other people and call NHS 111 whether or not they are showing symptoms.

"Anyone with a cough, fever, or shortness of breath who attends hospital and has recently returned from China, will be advised to follow signs to NHS 111 pods and call for advice, so they stay isolated from other patients and avoid causing unnecessary pressure in A&E."

Meanwhile, Britain could ban visitors from China in a bid to halt the deadly new virus.

US-style travel restrictions may include turning away anyone who has been in the country in the past 14 days.

It comes as two Brits were among those quarantined on a cruise ship in Japan after an outbreak of the virus.

Ten passengers out of 3,000 aboard the Diamond Princess have tested positive.

Government sources said it was unlikely tougher travel restrictions will be introduced before next week.

Flee now

Officials want to keep direct flights open for as long as possible after the Foreign Office urged 30,000 Brit nationals to flee China.

Hong Kong today imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all visitors from mainland China.

In Britain, where two people have tested positive for the virus, anyone from the centre of the outbreak in Wuhan is being told to self-isolate.

And Brit evacuees from the region are being quarantined in NHS accommodation on Merseyside.

But other travellers from China can move freely â€” unless they come down with a cough or fever, when they must stay indoors and call 111.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee yesterday.

He said the Government is "taking no chances" with British citizens at risk.

He told the BBC the advice to leave was a "science-led approach" based on the severity of the virus and its impact in China.
