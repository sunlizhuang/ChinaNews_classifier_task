Princeton University says only one student who recently traveled to China is still being assessed among those required to self-isolate amid the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak in that country.

The university in New Jersey told students, faculty and staff members who recently traveled to China to self-isolate, and officials said Monday that more than 100 undergraduate and graduate students had done so.

Princeton said New Jersey health officials issued new guidance Sunday that such students should be assessed based on risk. A university spokesman said Tuesday that all students assessed so far “have been low risk and do not need to self-quarantine." He said “No one is sick. No one has any symptoms."

Princeton earlier barred students, faculty and staff from traveling to China on university business or as part of university-sponsored programs.
