ON a recent visit to the Plaza automobile spare parts market located in the vicinity of Tibet Centre on MA Jinnah Road in Karachi, I was astonished to learn that the two pedestrian crossings had vanished and there was a solitary overhead pedestrian crossing along this stretch of a busy thoroughfare.

As a result crossing this road with perennial heavy traffic is a hazard particularly for senior citizens, women and children. A famous girlsâ€™ school is located at less than half a furlong from this busy site.

The provincial government and city authorities are requested to construct at least four pedestrian crossings in the vicinity of this busy area.
