The death toll from the novel coronavirus has climbed again in China, with 106 people now dead from the disease since it was detected at the end of last year.

The total number of confirmed cases in the country has also climbed beyond 4,000, and it has spread far beyond the borders of the Hubei province where it originated.

The first death outside Wuhan has been confirmed in Beijing, and the only other case of human to human infection has occurred in Vietnam.

Large parts of China are in lockdown and many people are stranded inside the epicentre.

Cases have been confirmed across Asia, in the United States and as far-reaching as Europe and Australia.

Australia

China

In China, 82 people have died from coronavirus and more than 2,700 have been infected.

The country's increasingly drastic containment efforts began with the January 22 suspension of plane, train and bus links to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China where the virus was first detected last month.

That lockdown has expanded to 17 cities with more than 50 million people - the most far-reaching disease-control measures ever imposed.

The first death outside Wuhan has been confirmed in Beijing, taking the death toll to 82.
