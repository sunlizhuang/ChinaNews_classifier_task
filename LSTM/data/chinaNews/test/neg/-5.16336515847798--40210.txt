A FLIGHT carrying British nationals from Wuhan airport, believed to be headed for RAF Brize Norton, set off last night.

It had previously been reported that a flight to evacuate around 200 British nationals from coronavirus-hit Wuhan was to arrive in the county earlier today.

It has been widely reported that the flight from China will be landing at RAF Brize Norton, and that patients will be taken to an 'NHS facility' upon their return and kept for 14 days, to make sure they do not have symptoms of the deadly virus.

A spokesman from the RAF base, however, said that reports of the flight landing there were 'purely speculation'.

Nick Gibb, the School Standards Minister, told Sky News that the flight is 'certainly coming to a military base in the UK'.
