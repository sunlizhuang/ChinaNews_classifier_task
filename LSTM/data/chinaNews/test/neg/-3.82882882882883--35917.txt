Part of NCT test suspended over safety concerns

Drivers are facing the prospect of having to attend their NCT twice after part of the test was suspended due to safety concerns.

The National Car Testing Service (NCTS) has suspended the use of vehicle lifts at testing centres ahead of a full safety audit.

The service has been carrying out inspections in recent days after "signs of cracking" were found in almost 50 lifts in the North. The discovery led to the suspension of Northern Ireland's MOT test - with thousands of drivers affected.

The same company supplied the lifts to the NCTS and initial investigations uncovered cracks in at least one lift here.

This makes it more widespread on the mainland than the notable SARS outbreak of 2002 and 2003.
