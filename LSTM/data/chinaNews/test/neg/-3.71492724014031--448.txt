That’s one crappy computer glitch.

Facebook was forced to apologise Saturday after a “technical issue” caused Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s name to appear as “Mr. S – thole” when translated from Burmese to English in posts on its platform, the company said.

According to the New York Post, the blunder was noticed on the second day of Xi’s visit to the country to sign infrastructure-related agreements with Burmese state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi.

That meant Facebook users who translated headlines from local outlets would be treated to breaking news stories like, “Dinner honours president s – thole.”

Meanwhile, Suu Kyi’s official Facebook page was filled with the obscenity as she posted about her time with Xi.

Facebook’s system did not have Chinese President Xi Jinping’s name in its Burmese database, leaving the site to guess the translation, the company said in a statement.

Testing the translations of similar words starting with “xi” and “shi” brought the same “sh – thole” results, it added.

“We fixed a technical issue that caused incorrect translations from Burmese to English on Facebook,” Facebook said.

“This should not have happened and we are taking steps to ensure it doesn’t happen again. We sincerely apologise for the offence this has caused.”

It comes as Myanmar protestors held a rally in Yangon to protest against any reinstatement of a controversial Chinese-backed mega-dam during the final day of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit in Naypyidaw.

The demonstrators called for the "termination" of the $US3.6 billion ($A5.23 billion) Myitsone project.

The 6000 megawatt dam was suspended in 2011 in the face of nationwide condemnation.
