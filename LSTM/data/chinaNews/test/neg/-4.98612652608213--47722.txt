New Zealand will have a case of novel coronavirus at some point, the Director-General of Health believes.

This is despite a range of border precautions, including a decision to stop non-New Zealanders, who have been to China recently, from entering the country.

All New Zealanders coming back from China will be spoken to by medical officials and asked to self isolate for two weeks.

The viral outbreak that began in China has infected more than 17,000 people globally. Most of the 362 deaths have been in China's central Hubei province, where illnesses from the new type of coronavirus were first detected in December.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the measures were put in place to help protect Pacific nations with less developed healthcare systems.​

"It is critically important that we both protect New Zealanders from the virus and play our part in the global effort to contain it."

The restrictions on travel began Monday, lasting for 14 days, with reviews every 48 hours.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade's advice to Kiwis travelling to China remains at the highest possible level – do not travel. It advised New Zealanders in China to leave at the earliest opportunity.

Bloomfield said New Zealand was expected to get a case of coronavirus, however, public health measures in China had reduced the risk.



"This virus may well be changing ... what we are seeing is a changing picture, a lot of uncertainty." Bloomfield added.

About 70 New Zealand residents and citizens are due to be evacuated from Wuhan, China this week.

They will stay for at least two weeks at a Navy quarantine centre in Whangaparaoa Military Training Facility in North Auckland. It is unclear who exactly will staff the installation when the evacuees arrive.

No-one showing symptoms would be permitted on the flight, Bloomfield said.

On Monday, Customs announced all travellers entering New Zealand would be manually processed individually, with eGates shut down. This includes New Zealand citizens, permanent residents and their families.

Halting all Chinese visitors for two weeks is expected to leave a $940 million hole in New Zealand's tourism earnings.

And there are fears of job losses if the travel ban is extended beyond the initial fortnight announced, especially for businesses relying on the Chinese market.

Several airlines have suspended their services to China, including Air New Zealand and Philippine Airlines.

Air New Zealand Chief Operational Integrity and Standards Officer Captain David Morgan said the suspension had been brought forward following increased border restrictions, which posed significant operational and logistical challenges.
