Chinese students accuse Australia of 'politically motivated' visa delays

Posted

The Department of Home Affairs has been accused of delaying the visa applications of Chinese PhD candidates, with prospective students telling state media they were victims of "politically motivated setbacks".

Key points: The students say cool relations between Beijing and Canberra may be to blame

Home Affairs says its assessment requirements are "not specific to Chinese nationals"

Concern is growing over how research collaboration with China may be used

A group of 135 Chinese PhD students and 30 other visiting students sent an email to the state-owned Global Times tabloid newspaper, saying they had all experienced lengthy delays on their Australian student visa applications.

The claims follow several reports last year detailing concern over the national security impacts of university research collaborations with Chinese entities.

In response, universities adopted new voluntary guidelines to combat foreign interference and risky research partnerships.

One of the would-be postgraduate students said they had been left hanging for 17 months, while the majority said they had waited more than five months since applying.

Most of the students were studying in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) related fields, the newspaper reported.

On its website, the Department says 90 per cent of applicants for postgraduate research visas receive a decision within four months.

So are the long-waiting times due to "paranoid voices against China" in Canberra — as the Global Times suggested in a follow-up editorial — or is it just a case of bureaucratic bungling?

'Considerable delays' for visas

The affected students told Chinese media their scholarships had expired, or were coming close to expiring, while they waited for Home Affairs to make a decision on their visas.

They blamed their troubles on the cool relations between Beijing and Canberra, and the ongoing debate over Chinese political influence in Australia.

Asked whether national security concerns were driving the alleged visa slow-down, Home Affairs told the ABC processing times were driven by a range of factors, including "assessments in relation to health, character and national security requirements".

"These requirements are not new and they are not specific to Chinese nationals," Home Affairs said in a statement.

It said the student visa grant rate for visa applicants for Chinese postgraduate students was 98.9 per cent, which was slightly higher than the overall grant rate of 98.6 per cent.

The University of Melbourne told the ABC it was supporting prospective PhD students "from various countries" experiencing slower-than-expected processing times.

In a statement, it said there were in many cases "considerable delays" in getting their visas approved.

"[The University of Melbourne] is communicating with the Government about this matter to help them to understand the problems caused for the students and for the University by these delays," it said.

'An environment of distrust'

Adam Ni, co-editor of the China analysis newsletter China Neican, told the ABC the main concern was that individuals could be linked to the Chinese Government, and conduct espionage including transferring sensitive technology to authorities there.

"At a broad level, there is increasing anxiety about Chinese party state influence and interference in Australia, this has extended into research collaboration, and recently into individuals that are conducting research," Mr Ni said.

"Certainly the cases are quite disturbing that came to light over the last decade about researchers that are conducting espionage or somehow infringing intellectual property."

But Mr Ni said Australia should be cautious but not overreact, or else run the risk of creating "an environment of distrust".

"The problem was just a few individuals that had links to the [Communist] Party, rather than a whole body of researchers," he said.

"There are still tremendous advantages from research collaboration and having an influx of Chinese students, a whole range of benefits that are really important to Australia's national interest."
