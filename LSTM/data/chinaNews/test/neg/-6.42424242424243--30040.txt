A student was terrified on waking up to find a burglar outside her bedroom door,

She bravely shouted out which caused the intruder to flee with her possessions, including a purse containing £200.

It was one of the five break-ins carried out by homeless drug addict Peter Terence Cooney.

He appeared in court with former university student, Arron Jermaine Gittens, also homeless and a drug addict.

Together and separately they targeted student accommodation to steal valuables, including laptops and mobile phones, to fund their drug use, Leicester Crown Court was told.

James Armstrong-Holmes, prosecuting, said that on August 10 at 9pm a student popped out of his flat in Clarendon Street, off Jarrom Street, in the city, for 15 minutes.

During that time Cooney had nimbly entered via an insecure window and made off with an iPhone, cigarettes and a wallet containing a bank card and a student ID card.

The card was then used at a local One Stop Shop to obtain £29 worth of goods and three other attempts to use it were unsuccessful.

The prosecutor said: "It caused considerable inconvenience to the victim."

BURLARIES

On October 4, Cooney and Gittens burgled a flat at The Shoe and Boot Factory student block, in Welford Road, in the city.

The occupant returned home to discover the break-in and missing items included an Apple Mac computer, an XBox and a Gucci bag, totalling £1,690.

A few days later, Cooney burgled a shared flat in Lower Brown Street, Leicester city centre, where a female occupant awoke to hear a male voice outside her bedroom door.

Mr Armstrong-Holmes said: "She became frightened and shouted out in Chinese.

"The person outside then closed the door and left the apartment."

Cooney had taken a purse containing £200 in cash, a Sony camera and other items, totalling £1,000.

On October 12, Gittens burgled another student flat in the Shoe and Boot Factory block taking a £1,200 MacBook Pro and other valuables.

On November 3, Gittens made two fraudulent transactions, for purchases of £19.99 and £14.70, using a stolen contactless bank card at the Shell garage on Narborough Road, in the city.

On November 15, Cooney broke into a student apartment at the Elfred Thomas Building, in Newarke Street, Leicester, when two mobile phones and a laptop, were taken.

On November 18 both Cooney and Gittens burgled another apartment at the Elfred Thomas Building.

They stole several XBox controllers and games consoles, alcohol, chocolate, and a toaster.

The court heard that 37-year-old Cooney, of no fixed address, was in breach of a previously imposed 18 month jail sentence.

He was said to have 57 offences on his criminal record.

Gittens, 31, of no fixed address, has 12 offences on his record, including a robbery.

Cooney pleaded guilty to five burglaries, Gittens admitted three burglaries and both admitted separately fraudulently using stolen bank cards.

The prosecutor said that CCTV footage had linked both men to the crimes.

Judge Ebraham Mooncey said: "You've been taking property that doesn't belong to you, sometimes when together and sometimes acting alone.

"Apart from losing possessions, people who get burgled feel their private space is never the same again.

"One can sympathise if someone is homeless, but if you think it's perfectly fine to break into someone's home it's no excuse and it's not acceptable - there are other means available.

"Gittens is less previously convicted than Cooney, but in both cases custody is inevitable."

DRUG ADDICTION

James Varley, mitigating for Cooney said: "He's been a drug user from a young age"

He said: "The relationship with his family has been toxic.

"He was homeless at the time.

"He'd been squatting in unused student accommodation but he sank to a new low due to personal information he received.

"It's difficult when you're on medication and homeless, although it doesn't excuse what he's done.

"He's ended up in a mess but finally he's trying to deal with the issues that he's got.

"He hopes when he comes out of prison he doesn't relapse straight away, as he did on the last occasion."

UNIVERSITY GRADUATE

Phillip Plant, representing Gittens, said: "There's a large gap between his offending from 2011 to 2017, which reflects the fact he got a university degree with a view to becoming a youth worker - before the drugs led him on a downward spiral.

"He now intends to make positive changes to his life and he's highly motivated to achieve his potential.

"This isn't a lifestyle he wishes to continue and wants to deal with his drug addiction.

"When he was released from his last sentence he was sofa surfing and homeless; they'd been living in an empty student flat."

THE SENTENCES

Cooney was jailed for three and a half years.

Gittens was jailed for two years and three months.
