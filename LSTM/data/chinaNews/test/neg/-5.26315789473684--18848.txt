Ontario’s chief medical officer of health has told Canadian Press, the province is ramping up preparations to deal with a new viral illness that has killed at least 17 people in China.

Doctor David Williams says the risk to Ontarians remains low, but says he wouldn’t be surprised if the emerging strain of coronavirus makes its way to the province. Williams says front line healthcare workers in hospitals and clinics are already asking anyone with flu-like symptoms about their travel history to better diagnose and track the new virus.

Williams says an approved method to test for the virus, was used to rule out three potential cases in Ontario.
