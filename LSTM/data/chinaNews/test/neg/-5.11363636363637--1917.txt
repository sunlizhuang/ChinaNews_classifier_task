CASPER, Wyo. — Wyoming’s United States Senator John Barrasso supports U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to authorize an airstrike which killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani.

Barrasso reiterated his support on Tuesday, Jan. 7 after appearing on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.”

“The President made the right decision and he saved American lives,” Barrasso said on Facebook.

In the Fox interview, Barrasso said that Iran had organized 11 attacks in the past two months and that an American had been killed, adding that Soliemani was becoming more “bold.”

“We know he was a war criminal and it was the right decision,” he told the hosts.

When asked whether he was concerned Soliemani’s killing could lead to “broader conflict,” Barrasso said he was not.

“No, I am not, we don’t want war,” he said.

Barrasso said that it was important the U.S. be able to negotiate from a “position of strength,” adding that Trump’s decision put the country in such a position.

U.S. officials are reportedly preparing for a possible Iranian retaliation against an American military commander and are warning ships in the Mideast of possible actions from Iran.

Wyoming’s U.S. Representative Liz Cheney also said last week that she supports President Donald Trump’s decision to authorize the strike.

Representative Tyler Lindholm of the Wyoming House of Representatives expressed concern on Jan. 3 over the killing.

“The biggest question of the day is whether or not the assassination of Soleimani will endanger the lives of every American soldier and diplomat in the area?” Lindholm said on Facebook. “I pray that the right choice has been made and that this does not expand the war in the Middle East.”

Oil prices jumped on Friday over concerns that the airstrike might prompt a response from Iran, according to the Associated Press.

China, Russia and France expressed concern over the killing and what it could mean for global politics.
