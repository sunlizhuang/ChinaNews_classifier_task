(Bloomberg) -- Warm weather may not slow down the spread of the coronavirus, said a top U.S. health official, counter to a theory put forward by President Donald Trump. U.S. disease experts are still waiting to hear whether they’ll be allowed by China to go to the outbreak’s front lines.

Mobile World Congress, the premier mobile-industry conference, was canceled by its organizers over concerns about the spread of the deadly pathogen. In China, President Xi Jinping said the country would meet its economic goals while battling the coronavirus that has now claimed 1,115 lives. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said it would take time to measure the impact of the outbreak.

Bloomberg is tracking the outbreak on the terminal and online.

Europe to Step Up Crisis Preparations (3:47 p.m. NY)

The European Union is preparing for potential medical shortages and the risk of travel restrictions that could disrupt the bloc’s border-free zone.

During an emergency meeting scheduled in Brussels on Thursday, EU health ministers plan to ask the bloc’s executive arm to assess the consequences of global health threats like the coronavirus on the availability of medicine and the security of supply chains, according to a draft of a joint communique seen by Bloomberg. The draft is still subject to changes.

The document acknowledges that “measures regarding travel” could be necessary if the situation deteriorates, while ministers will vow to protect the “free movement” of people -- a key pillar of EU integration -- in such case.

Similar temporary measures have been applied in the past to limit the flow of asylum seekers from poorer to richer EU members.

Mnuchin: More Data Needed to Assess Impact (3:17 p.m. NY)

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday that two to four more weeks of economic data are needed to forecast the impact of coronavirus.

Mnuchin also told a Senate Finance Committee hearing that implementation of the first phase of a U.S. trade deal with China is being slowed by the virus. On Tuesday, White House National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien said agricultural purchases under the deal may not be as large as the Trump administration had hoped due to coronavirus.

China Keeps U.S. Experts Waiting (2:39 p.m. NY)

Top U.S. health experts seeking to join an international group heading to the center of the coronavirus outbreak in China said they still have no answer on whether they’ll be allowed into the country.

U.S. officials have said they’ve offered for weeks to send front-line disease experts to China to study the outbreak, which originated in the city of Wuhan, and consult with colleagues there on how to stop it.

“We haven’t been invited yet,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters Wednesday.

Mobile World Congress Is Canceled (1:45 p.m. NY)

Mobile World Congress, the premier mobile-industry conference scheduled this month in Spain, was canceled over concerns about the spread of the coronavirus.

“With due regard to the safe and healthy environment in Barcelona and the host country today, the GSMA has canceled MWC Barcelona 2020 because the global concern regarding the coronavirus outbreak, travel concern and other circumstances, make it impossible for the GSMA to hold the event” John Hoffman, the chief executive officer of conference organizer GSMA Ltd., said in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Intel Corp., MediaTek Inc., AT&T Inc., Cisco Systems Inc. and Sprint Corp. joined Ericsson AB, Sony Corp. and others earlier this week in canceling plans to attend MWC Barcelona later this month.

CDC Says Warm Weather May Not Slow Outbreak (1:06 p.m. NY)

It’s too early to know if warm spring weather that typically heralds the end of cold and flu season will also slow the coronavirus, said a top official from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Wednesday that she hopes “it will go down as the weather warms up, but it’s premature to assume that.”

Story continues

Messonnier’s remarks Wednesday run counter to a theory put forward by President Donald Trump that heat would stop the new coronavirus.

“The heat, generally speaking, kills this kind of virus,” Trump said Monday at the White House. “A lot of people think that goes away in April as the heat comes in.” At a campaign rally this week, he went further, according to a CNN report on his remarks, saying, “in theory when it gets a little warmer it miraculously goes away.”

During a call with reporters Wednesday Messonnier said, “I would caution against over-interpreting that hypothesis.”

The theory that the coronavirus will slow down when warm weather sets in is mostly based on the fact that other respiratory viruses such as influenza exhibit seasonal patterns, not specific data about this new virus, she said.

More from the CDC press briefing:

CDC officials haven’t yet been allowed into China or been given direct access to raw data on the epidemic.Some states conducting tests using CDC coronavirus test kits are getting inconclusive results. The CDC said it was working to resolve the problem.CDC is optimistic that lower case counts coming from China in the last few days mean that the country’s quarantine is working, but that it’s “too soon to say that for sure,” Messonnier said.

Fed Chair Says Too Early to Know Virus Impact (11:15 a.m. NY)

Carnival Sees Material Impact on Results (9:28 a.m. NY)

Carnival Corp. said it foresees a slowdown in global bookings and an increase in canceled voyages that will will have a material impact on financial results that wasn’t anticipated because of the coronavirus oubreak.

“As a result of coronavirus, the company believes the impact on its global bookings and canceled voyages will have a material impact on its financial results which was not anticipated in the company’s previous 2020 earnings guidance,” the Miami-based cruise ship operator said in a statement Wednesday.

The company said it was unable to determine the full financial impact on the current fiscal year.

DBS Evacuates 300 Employees in Singapore (2:25 p.m. HK)

DBS Group Holdings Ltd. evacuated 300 employees from an office floor in the heart of Singapore’s financial district after one of its workers tested positive for the coronavirus.

Southeast Asia’s biggest bank has told the staff members on Level 43 at Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 3 to work from home for the time being, the company said in a statement. The number of evacuees was given in a memo seen by Bloomberg earlier and confirmed by the bank.

The coronavirus had already been detected in Singapore’s financial district earlier this week, prompting some companies to send workers home and temperature screening checkpoints to be set up at the entrances of several towers. A worker at an unnamed firm in Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 1 was confirmed as being infected with the virus over the weekend.

Singapore last week raised its disease response level to the same grade used during the SARS epidemic, as it braced for what Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said was a “major test for our nation.” Singapore has at least 47 confirmed cases of coronavirus.

Chinese Company Says It Can Make Gilead’s Virus Drug (11:18 a.m. HK)

A Chinese drugmaker said it has started mass-producing an experimental drug from Gilead Sciences Inc. that has the potential to fight the novel coronavirus, as China accelerates its effort to find a treatment for the widening outbreak.

Suzhou-based BrightGene Bio-Medical Technology Co. said it has developed the technology to synthesize the active pharmaceutical ingredients of remdesivir, Gilead’s drug that is a leading candidate to treat the highly-infectious virus that’s killed more than 1,000 people. The drug isn’t licensed or approved anywhere in the world yet.

While BrightGene said that it intends to license the drug from Gilead, its move to start manufacturing at this early stage is highly unusual and a potential infringement of the American company’s intellectual property. It comes a week after Chinese researchers filed an application to patent the drug to treat the new coronavirus.

Singapore Not Ruling Out More Stringent Measures (10:50 a.m. HK)

Singapore is not ruling out more stringent measures to tackle the coronavirus outbreak if the situation worsens, according to Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong.
