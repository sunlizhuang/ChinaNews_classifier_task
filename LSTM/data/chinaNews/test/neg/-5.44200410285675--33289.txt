KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian Consultative Council of Islamic Organization (MAPIM) today demanded China to explain a report accusing it of harvesting organs from Muslim Uighur prisoners for rich Saudis.

Its president Mohd Azmi Abdul Hamid, in a statement, said the report had quoted a witness confirming "slaughter on demand" of China's Muslim prisoners.

"The death trade in forced organ transplants must be condemned in the strongest terms. The report even claimed that the extractions were conducted on live victims,"

According to CCN.com, a Saudi with the paperwork and arrangements in place went to one of a number of hospitals in China where the operation took place and the transaction was completed.

The report claimed that the man was a Muslim and a member of Xinjiang’s Uighur minority.

Azmi called on international Muslim scholars to voice their concern and urged for an investigation on China’s alleged trade in forced organ harvesting.

"Muslim scholars cannot tolerate such utterly odious and wicked trade," he stressed.

An independent tribunal investigating China’s trade in forced organ harvesting from prisoners had published its final judgment, last June, describing China’s guilt as to be “beyond a reasonable doubt.”

The tribunal decided unanimously that forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience has been practiced for a substantial period of time involving a very substantial number of victims, said CCN.

The tribunal also found that religious minorities had been targeted for forced organ “donations” possibly involving Falun Gong practitioners and Uighur Muslims.

In 2014, the Chinese government claimed that forced organ harvesting had been outlawed in the country but the independent tribunal found it to be not true after hearing from eyewitness and expert testimony.
