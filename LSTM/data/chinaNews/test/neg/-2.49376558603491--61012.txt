Yesterday Patently Apple posted a report titled "The U.S. Attorney General reveals that a U.S. Consortium may take a Controlling Stake in Nokia and/or Ericsson for 5G." If you didn't grasp why the U.S. is taking such a hard stance on locking out Huawei in the U.S., the report made it clear what the issues were. Today we learned that Huawei has now lashed out against Verizon with a patent infringement lawsuit.

A Chinese report posted today states that "Huawei filed lawsuits against U.S. wireless carrier Verizon in two U.S. district courts Thursday, accusing it of stealing its intellectual property.

The Chinese telecom equipment maker is seeking unspecified damages for the alleged unauthorized use of 12 of its patents, mainly related to optical transport network technology, used to carry signals.

“Verizon’s products and services have benefited from patented technology that Huawei developed over many years of research and development,” Huawei chief legal officer Song Liuping said in a statement, demanding Verizon either pay royalties or stop illegally using Huawei’s patents.

According to an indictment seen by Caixin, Huawei held several rounds of negotiations with Verizon over the issue between February 2019 and January 2020, but the two companies were unable to reach a licensing agreement.

On Thursday, Verizon described the lawsuits as “nothing more than a PR stunt" and a “sneak attack” on both the company and the United States, the South China Morning Post reported, citing an emailed statement from the wireless carrier.

CNBC's reported added that "The Chinese firm holds over 11,000 patents in the U.S., many of which are crucial for the running of mobile networks. While Verizon doesn’t buy directly from Huawei, it may purchase products from vendors using the Chinese firm’s patented technology.

Huawei says the alleged infringements relate to 12 patents in areas from computer networking to video communications, claiming that Verizon has “greatly profited” from the use of these."

The bottom line is that Verizon said in a statement: "The action lacks merit, and we look forward to vigorously defending our company and our nation." It would seem by Verizon's specific emphasis on defending "our nation," that this is a political fight as much as it is technological one.
