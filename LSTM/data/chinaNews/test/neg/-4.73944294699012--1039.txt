"We urge the United States not to abuse force and call on relevant parties to exercise restraint to prevent a spiral escalation. Efforts should be made to resume dialogue and consultation as soon as possible to cool off tensions," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said.



BEIJING, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- China urged the United States not to abuse force and called on relevant parties to exercise restraint to prevent a spiral escalation in the Middle East and the Gulf region, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Monday.

Spokesman Geng Shuang made the remarks at a daily news briefing when asked for comments about the current situation in the region as tensions in U.S.-Iran relations are escalating. The United States claimed it has targeted 52 Iranian sites, which will be hit if Iran strikes any Americans or American assets. Iran said some 35 U.S. targets in the region are within reach.

"Worsening of tensions in the Middle East and the Gulf region is the last thing anyone wants to see. Ensuring peace and stability in the region is of vital importance to the whole world," Geng said.

Power politics is always resented and short-lived, he said, adding the U.S. military adventurism goes against basic norms governing international relations and aggravates tensions and turbulence in the region, Geng said.

"We urge the United States not to abuse force and call on relevant parties to exercise restraint to prevent a spiral escalation. Efforts should be made to resume dialogue and consultation as soon as possible to cool off tensions," he added.

China will continue to uphold an objective and just position and play a constructive role in maintaining peace and security in the Middle East and the Gulf region, Geng said. â–
