While doctors on the frontline of China’s new coronavirus epidemic face the monumental job of treating an ever-growing number of patients while risking getting infected themselves due to a drastic shortage of masks and other protective equipment, the ebola virus continues its own reign of terror.

Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a rare but severe, often fatal illness in humans. It is a highly contagious virus with a mortality rate which can be as high as 90 per cent and is often named as the second deadliest virus in the world, after the marburg virus.

The 2014 ebola outbreak is the largest in history and the first in west Africa. It affected multiple countries, sparked many travel warnings and claimed the lives of more than 10,000 people, mainly in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, according to World Health Organisation (WHO) data.

The outbreak started in Guinea and then moved across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia. The current 2018-2019 outbreak in eastern DRC is highly complex, with insecurity adversely affecting public health response activities.

The ebola virus is passed on by contact with the blood, body fluids, secretions or organs of an infected or recently deceased person.

The death rate is typically high, ranging from 20 per cent up to 90 per cent in some outbreaks, depending on the species of the virus, according to WHO.

Victims experience flu-like symptoms including fever, headache, muscle aches and a sore throat. This progresses to haemorrhagic disease, including bleeding in the eyes, mouth and ears, internal organs and skin haemorrhages.

You could catch the virus by something as simple as wiping a tear off a person’s face or as intimate as the transfer of saliva or semen.

The virus is formed in fruit bats, often transferred to monkeys by contaminated fruit they eat before humans become the “accidental carriers”. A human can contract it by eating monkey meat or bats in African nations or if bitten by the animals.

Laboratory findings include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes.

Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute in the transmission of ebola.

People are infectious as long as their blood and secretions contain the virus.

The WHO’s advance team, which arrived in China to deal with the deadly coronavirus on Monday, is headed by Bruce Aylward, who oversaw the organisation’s 2014-2016 response to the ebola epidemic in West Africa.

Ahead of the team’s arrival, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned there had been some “concerning instances” of cases overseas in people with no travel history to China.

“We may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg,” he tweeted.

WHO said although signs are now “extremely positive” in Congo that the ebola outbreak is winding down, the epidemic remains a global health emergency.

WHO defines a global emergency as an “extraordinary event” that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a co-ordinated international response.

Last July, the global health body declared it a “public health emergency of international concern” – a designation which gave WHO greater powers to restrict travel and boost funding.

Security risks brought vaccination efforts to a standstill for days at a time, while the virus continued to spread in areas where WHO and others didn’t have safe passage.

To date, ebola has killed more than 2200 people in the DRC, making it the second-deadliest epidemic in history. The decision to maintain WHO’s global emergency declaration for ebola came after a meeting on Wednesday of WHO’s ebola expert committee.

“As long as there is a single case of ebola in an area as insecure and unstable as eastern (Congo), the potential remains for a much larger epidemic,” said Dr Tedros.

“It’s not over. Any single case could reignite the epidemic.”

For the epidemic to be declared over, there have to be no new cases reported for 42 days — double the incubation period.

“Although the world is now focused on coronavirus, we cannot and must not forget ebola,” Dr Tedros said, adding that he would travel to the DRC on Thursday to meet President Felix Tshisekedi and senior government officials to discuss ways to strengthen the country’s health care system.

Much of the outbreak has struck regions of Congo described as war zones and health workers have been under repeated attacks from numerous rebel groups and from communities wary of international aid workers.

Dr Tedros said he hoped that by the time the ebola expert group meets again – likely within three months – they will be able to declare an end to the ebola epidemic.

Vaccines to protect against ebola are under development and have been used to help control the spread of outbreaks in Guinea and the DRC, according to WHO.

Early supportive care with rehydration and treating symptoms improves survival chances.
