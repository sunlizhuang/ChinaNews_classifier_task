The Corona virus is capable of human transmission and as per experts it causes cold-like symptoms and can even cause breathing problems. The virus is able to spread during its incubation period, before any symptoms appear. According to the World Health Organization, the incubation period can be anywhere between 2 to 10 days.

Dr Monica Mahajan, Director, Internal Medicine at Max Healthcare talked to NDTV about coronavirus and its impact on India.

It is a highly contagious virus,” she highlights, adding that it is “bound to spread in other countries.

In order to contain the virus from spreading to other nations, Chinese government took measures such as isolating and cutting off regions like Wuhan among other majorly affected provinces from the rest of the nation, Dr. Mahajan explained.

Despite these urgent measures, we have to realise that the world has shrunk. Air travel is still happening and that has led to the transmission of this virus into other nations. This virus is an air borne or droplet virus, so the people who have travelled from China in the last 14 days, maybe in an incubation period, may have the virus in their bodies.
