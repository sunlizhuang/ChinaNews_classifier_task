For almost half a century the free world, led by the United States, waged a Cold War against the communist-led old Soviet Union and hot wars against communism in Korea and Vietnam. While communism replaced the czars in Russia in 1917, the major expansion of Russia came about after World War II when the countries that were supposedly freed from Hitler came under the tyrannical heel of Joseph Stalin and the communist control of the Soviet Union.

It was a brutal time in world history and once both sides had nuclear weapons the fate of mankind was at stake. When Cuba became a communist satellite of the Soviet Union, led by Fidel Castro, we probably came as close to nuclear war as any time since the Cold War began. Communist leaders also took control of China, North Vietnam, Cambodia, Cuba and North Korea.

While there can never be an exact accounting of how many people were killed to achieve communist control the Black Book of Communism probably comes as close to an accurate measurement as any other source. They estimate the number of deaths as follows: USSR, 20 million; China, 65 million; Vietnam, 1 million; North Korea, 2 million; and Cambodia, 2 million. There were additional deaths in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa and Afghanistan amounting to an additional 3.5 million people killed. Almost 100,000,000 million people have died due to the ambitions of communist leaders.

So why today should our people care about this staggering number of deaths due to communism? China and its 1.4 billion people are still communists. Cuba, 90 miles off our coast, also remains communist, as does North Korea. Two of the three have nuclear weapons.

We have Bernie Sanders currently at the top of those Democrat candidates seeking the nomination for President who honeymooned in the old Soviet Union. Sanders has stated that in the 1960 presidential debates between John Kennedy and Richard Nixon, both critics of Castro, that he almost wanted to "puke" due their criticism of Castro. Even now, as we view the utter disaster in Venezuela, Sanders acknowledges the violent crackdown by the Maduro government on the people but he offers no reason why this socialistic state is bankrupt when it has huge oil reserves. He criticizes Maduro but not socialism.

Then we have good old John Brennan, former director of our CIA and fierce critic of President Trump. This is the same John Brennan who voted for Gus Hall, the communist candidate for president of the U.S. in 1976. In 1976 the Cold War with the Soviet Union was still intense. How he could ever justify his vote is beyond me, but even more unbelievable is that President Obama would appoint him as director of our CIA.

Not to be outdone among the Democrat ranks we have New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who briefly was a Democrat candidate for president. He went to Russia when Reagan called it the "Evil Empire," then he became a supporter and activist for the Sandinista Party in Nicaragua when the Reagan administration characterized the Sandinista's as tyrannical and communist. He also honeymooned in communist Cuba when the travel ban existed.

You have to question the Democratsâ€™ respect for our laws be it travel bans, sanctuary cities or illegal entry into our country.

Perhaps my favorite exchange between the Russians and Democrats was when President Obama was caught on a hot mike telling Russian President Dmitry Medvedev the following: "On all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this can be solved but it's important for him to give me some space."

Medvedev replies: "Yeah, I understand. I understand your message about. space for you..."

Obama then says: "This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility." To which Medvedev responds: "I understand. I will transmit this information to Vladimir, and I stand with you."

Had Trump said exactly the same words the Democrats would have sought immediate impeachment!

For the better part of three years we've heard this gigantic lie about Trump/Russian collusion. Yet the coziest of relationship with the Russians, communism and socialism has been exemplified over the years by socialist Sanders, Brennan, De Blasio and Obama.

The same Obama who did not give the Ukrainians the lethal aid to stop Russian aggression. It was Trump who provided Ukraine the Javelin missiles to stop Russian tanks. Don't recall Adam Schiff mentioning this during his failed impeachment trial.
