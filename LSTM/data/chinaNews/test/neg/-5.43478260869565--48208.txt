Hainan Airlines has suspended flights between Budapest and Chongqing from February 7 until March 27, Liszt Ferenc International operator Budapest Airport said on Facebook.

Hainan Airlines announced the relaunch of its Chongqing-Budapest direct service only ten days ago.

Shanghai Airlines has also suspended its Budapest-Shanghai flights with stopovers in Xi’an and Chengdu, though it will continue to operate its direct flight between Shanghai and the Hungarian capital.

A number of big commercial airlines have suspended flights to China because of the outbreak of the coronavirus.
