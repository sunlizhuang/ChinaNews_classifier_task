The Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday allayed the public’s fears over the reported ‘mysterious’ viral pneumonia disease being linked to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China.

“DOH assures the public that there is no reported case of SARS in the country and there is no reason for panic,” the department said in an advisory.

It also advised the public to be wary of messages circulating regarding a SARS case allegedly seen in a health clinic, calling them false information.

Last Jan. 5, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III instructed the Bureau of Quarantine (BQQ) to be on alert for travelers “manifesting fever or signs of respiratory infection,” in all seaports and airports in the country.

China said the mysterious viral pneumonia outbreak that has affected 59 people was not the flu-like virus SARS that killed hundreds more than a decade ago.

The infection was first reported last week in Wuhan, a central Chinese city with a population of over 11 million — leading to online speculation about a resurgence of the highly contagious SARS virus.

However, health authorities in the central Chinese city of Wuhan reported on Jan. 11 the first death from a new type of coronavirus.

The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported that seven other people were in critical condition.

It said 41 were suffering from pneumonia caused by a “preliminarily determined new type of coronavirus” as of last Friday, down from the earlier figure of 59. It said those were in stable condition and at least two had been released from a hospital. (with reports from Analou De Vera, AFP, and the Associated Press)
