Brilliant. Bring them here and let them wander Main St. USA. How many flights? Will the plane be fumigated and set out on the far end of the field to decontaminate or will it immediately turn around and fly out to the mid-west somewhere?

According to twitter a plane from Wuhan just landed in San Francisco. But the Wuhan airport is supposedly closed? I have no doubt we have a lot of citizens there, and also, that a lot of locals want to get out (bribery, anyone?) In any event, all direct flights from China need to be halted.

I believe this is a Soros/China/Clinton dumpster fire creation...as they Arkanicide people, eat babies, sell children, this is NOTHING to them to kill a few people to create chaos.

Link please? Then check the San Francisco airport, or the airlines which fly into San Fran — to get a flight number. This can be verified with not *TOO* much trouble, right?

Will the plane be fumigated and set out on the far end of the field to decontaminate or will it immediately turn around and fly out to the mid-west somewhere? I understand there is a Caribbean island owned by the recently murdered (he didnt commit suicide) Jeffrey Epstein available for quarantine purposes.

“This will stop the street riots.” How extremely convenient for the Chinese PTB. Conspiracy theorists could draw some interesting conclusions.

Good thinking. Just as long as the Thought Police don’t kick your door down (and other like-minded thinkers), we should be o.k. Yep, how about some Civil Asset Forfeiture here? Ghislaine Maxwell did not hang herself in prison. Perhaps MOSSAD can help find her./S

Go to youtube and type in coronavirus. You will find lots of videos. They talk about Korea on the video entitled: China warns virus spread accelerating. I am amazed at how many videos have been done on this virus!

I thought it was just me. Quarantine means NO ONE leaves.

Make that 1000 returning to the US. From other FR threads, Russia and France are also bringing back their diplomats. Probably all countries are. What could possibly go wrong?



To: dp0622

Exactly.

Shaking my head in disbelief. Probably powerful people among them who will refuse to be quarantined once they get back home. And what of the flight crews? And their families? SMH

Was this flight cancelled? If so when? If cancelled, was this an action by our president?

Speaking of flight crews... Japanese airline crews to wear masks to prevent coronavirus infection But not eye protection.
