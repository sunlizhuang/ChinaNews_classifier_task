New Delhi: The Centre has asked people to refrain from travelling to China in view of the deadly Coronavirus outbreak that has claimed lives of more than 300 people and spread to 25 countries including India, the US, the UK and Russia.

In its recent advisory, the Union Health Ministry said that, in case of travel, they could be quarantined on return from China.

“Indians should refrain from travelling to China. In case of travel, on return from China, they could be quarantined. Anyone with travel history in China since 15th January 2020 and from now on could be quarantined,” the ministry said.

Earlier today, India temporarily suspended the e-visa facility for Chinese travellers and foreigners residing in China

“Due to certain current developments, travel to India on E-visas stands temporarily suspended with immediate effect. This applies to holders of Chinese passports and applicants of other nationalities residing in the People’s Republic of China,” said the Indian Embassy in Beijing.

It further said that if any Chinese traveller wants to visit India due to some emergency then he or she needs to contact the Indian consulates.

“Holders of already issued E-visas may note that these are no longer valid. All those who have a compelling reason to visit India may contact the Embassy of India in Beijing or the Indian consulates in Shanghai or Guangzhou, and the Indian Visa Application Centres in these cities,” it added.

Earlier today, India airlifted the second batch of 323 stranded Indian nationals and seven Maldivian citizens from Coronavirus-hit Wuhan in China, taking the total number of people evacuated to 654.

Air India's jumbo B747 plane had on early Saturday evacuated 324 Indians from the Wuhan city - the ground zero of the Coronavirus epidemic.

After the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the outbreak of Coronavirus a global health emergency several international carriers acting quickly placed global travel restrictions.
