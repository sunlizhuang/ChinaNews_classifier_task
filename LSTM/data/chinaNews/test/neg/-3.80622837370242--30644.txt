Port operator takes steps to protect staff due to the coronavirus outbreak in China

DP World operates at three ports in mainland China and at another port in Hong Kong.

Dubai-based DP World has reportedly suspended all staff travel to China until further notice due to the coronavirus outbreak.

"All travel to China is suspended until further notice, unless for emergency purposes. We continue to monitor WHO and Government advice," a spokesman at Dubai-based DP World told Reuters on Tuesday.

DP World operates at three ports in mainland China and at another port in Hong Kong.

Chinese nationals would be permitted to travel to China if they needed to go home, the spokesman was quoted as saying.

The move comes as China on Tuesday urged its citizens to postpone travel abroad as it expanded unprecedented efforts to contain a viral outbreak that has killed 106 people.

The epidemic, which experts believe emanated from a wild animal market in the city of Wuhan last month, has spread around China and to more than a dozen other countries despite the extraordinary travel curbs.

Authorities initially sealed off Wuhan and other cities in central Hubei province late last week, trapping more than 50 million people, in a bid to contain the virus as the high-travel Lunar New Year holiday unfolded.

China then halted international and domestic group tours. It also imposed a wide range of travel restrictions inside China, including on long-distance buses.

The DP World spokesman added in comments published by Reuters: "All our ports are complying with the official government health ministry directive for operations, staff health precautions and risk mitigation plans."

Reuters added that Emirates has advised its flight crew to stay in their hotels when on a layover in China due to the coronavirus, according to an internal notice seen by the news agency.
