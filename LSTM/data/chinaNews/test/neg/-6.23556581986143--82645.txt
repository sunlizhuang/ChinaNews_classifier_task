Four Iranians have died after contracting coronavirus, with health authorities warning the virus has spread to multiple cities, while Israel and Lebanon declared their first domestic cases as the deadly epidemic spreads across the Middle East.

Asked on Friday if the new cases put the crisis at a tipping point, the World Health Organization director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the “window of opportunity is narrowing, so we need to act quickly before it closes completely”.

“This outbreak could go in any direction,” Tedros added. “If we do well, we can avert any serious crisis, but if we squander the opportunity then we will have a serious problem on our hands.”

Iranian health authorities reported two fatalities on Friday, according to Mehr news agency, adding to the two elderly patients who died on Wednesday. A further 14 people tested positive for the virus.

The outbreak in Iran began in the city of Qom, an often-visited religious destination. The health ministry official Minou Mohrez warned it had since spread to several cities, including the capital, Tehran, according to the official IRNA news agency.

“It’s possible that it exists in all cities in Iran,” she said, adding the source of the virus was likely a Chinese worker in Qom.

As the country held a parliamentary election on Friday, state television showed voters in Qom wearing surgical masks. Earlier this week, authorities in Iran closed all schools in Qom as a precaution and called for the suspension of the city’s religious gatherings.

The threat posed is especially concerning in Iran after several years of tightening US sanctions by the Trump administration that have dangerously undermined the domestic health care system. In addition, the sharp devaluation of the Iranian rial makes it extremely unlikely its government would be able to throw the resources at an epidemic as witnessed in China.

To prevent infections, neighbouring Iraq shut its land crossings with Iran. However, the virus already appears to have leaked out of the country and across international borders.

In Lebanon, the health minister, Hamad Hassan, reported the country’s first case of the virus on Friday, stating the patient was a 45-year-old woman who arrived on Thursday on a flight from Qom.

At a news conference in Beirut, he said the ministry was also following up on the cases of two other people suspected of contracting Covid-19.

The new coronavirus, which causes the illness recently named by the WHO as Covid-19, has infected more than 76,000 people in 27 countries and led to more than 2,200 deaths since December.

There have been only few cases in the Middle East so far. Nine have been confirmed in the United Arab Emirates, seven of whom are Chinese nationals, and one in Egypt.

In Israel, the health ministry announced the country’s first case, saying the patient was an Israeli woman who had been quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan.

The ship was carrying more than 3,700 people in early February, when 10 passengers were diagnosed with Covid-19. Since it was docked and quarantined in the port of Yokohama, a total of 634 passengers and crew have been infected, with two people dying.

Eleven Israelis who initially tested negative were flown home by chartered plane overnight on Thursday. However, on arrival, the woman failed a breath sample check, the ministry said, and was immediately moved to a special isolation unit at a hospital near Tel Aviv.

The repatriation of people from the Diamond Princess, as well, as parts of China and other countries affected by the coronavirus, has caused fears of outbreaks at their return.

In Ukraine, protestors on Thursday attacked buses carrying 45 Ukrainians and 27 other evacuees from the Chinese province of Wuhan, the virus’ centre, to the small town of Novi Sanzhary, fearing they would be a health hazard.

Videos showed dozens of protestors lighting tires ablaze and hurling rocks at the buses carrying the evacuees. Riot police broke up the crowds and detained 24 people.

The Ukrainian government has planned to quarantine the people at a sanatorium there for two weeks. In an attempt to calm the demonstrators, the health minister, Zoryana Skaletska, pledged to spend the next two in the same sanatorium.

A selfie she posted from her room in quarantine was followed by the hashtags calling on Ukrainians “not to fear our own” and “I am not afraid of the virus, I am with you.”

Across the Mediterranean in northern Italy, local authorities announced what they said was the first locally transmitted case. Giulio Gallera, a member of the Lombardy regional government, said the patient fell ill after meeting a friend who had recently returned from China and was now in intensive care.

“We have introduced a compulsory quarantine for all those who have been in contact with the patients who tested positive,” the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said, adding that anyone who had been in “areas of risk” over the past two weeks should stay at home.
