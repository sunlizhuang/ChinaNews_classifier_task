The World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency. The coronavirus (since early January) has taken 450+ lives in China and has left more than 17,300 people infected. Even Pakistan is not immune to the panic that this virus has wrought, with unconfirmed reports that it has affected 8 people, as of yet.

While the whole world is coming together to help those in need, some religious fundamentalists took this opportunity to do what they do best â€“ assume the worst. They say the coronavirus is an azaab (punishment) from God for the Chinese. Their belief is that since the Chinese authorities ripped off the hijab from Muslim women in Xijiang, Allah has decided to punish them through the coronavirus.

A Vengeful God?

In times like these where everyone needs help, rather than doing just that, some people are enjoying the misery that people with the virus had to endure. They are calling it Godâ€™s vengeance.

Hereâ€™s what they have to say:

#Pakistani Cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi curses more severe #Coronavirus befall #China and its friends. "Coronavirus Allah ka azaab hai, ya Allah inpar aur naazil kar, unke yaaron par bhi naazil kar.."ðŸ‘‡ pic.twitter.com/kPLMAXcX9V â€” Tehzeeb (@Tehzeeb_1) February 3, 2020

Hamza Ali Abbasiâ€™s Reaction

Pakistani celebrity Hamza Ali Abbasi is known to stir up the pod from time to time. He took to Twitter to express his opposition towards such extremist thoughts and remarks. He said:

Azaab in this world ONLY comes to munkireen of a Rasool when he is among them, for the rest, there is the Judgment Day. Whether it be a virus outbreak or an earthquake, these are means to bring death on centre stage as a reminder for all. Show sympathy. May Allah protect us all.

In an attempt to showcase how insensitive and sad this whole scenario is, he further said:

So to those who are branding such incidents as Azaab in this world for whatever reason, STOP. Dont make a mockery out of Allah's deen and instead, help in any way U can or at least pray for the affected and for those who are helping them and trying to find a cure. #CoronaVirus https://t.co/AVS8drNiir â€” Hamza Ali Abbasi (@iamhamzaabbasi) February 3, 2020

While Hamza Ali Abbasiâ€™s view of the situation was not taken well on Twitter, some people did agree with him.

Whatâ€™s your take on people calling coronavirus an azaab, keeping in mind that coronavirus has spread to Pakistan and other countries as well?
