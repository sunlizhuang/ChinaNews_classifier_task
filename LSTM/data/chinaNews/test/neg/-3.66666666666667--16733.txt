The deadly Wuhan coronavirus had a first confirmed case in the U.S., contracted by an unidentified man in Washington state.

The man, a Snohomish County resident in his 30s, reportedly traveled alone to Sea-Tac International Airport on Jan. 15 after visiting the Wuhan area of China. After feeling ill, he visited an unknown clinic on Jan. 19 and was later admitted to Providence Regional Medical Center Everett.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a specimen was collected and sent overnight for testing, and confirmed the case to be the 2019-nCoV infection on Jan. 21, making it the first known case of the disease in the U.S.

"No one wants to be the first in the nation in these types of situations, but these are the types of situations that public health and its partners train and prepare for. Because of this, everything has been going along quite smoothly,” said Dr. Chris Spitters, Health Officer of Snohomish Health District in a press release from the Washington State Department of Health.

In a statement, Gov. Jay Inslee applauded health officials for their swift reaction: "The quick response also shows the importance of a strong public health system, which we have here in Washington state. We want to make it clear: our teams are employing a layered approach to combat this."

If found to be not contagious, the man could be released from the hospital in 48 hours.

The outbreak, believed to have started mid-December at a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, China, had at least 224 reported cases from people who recently traveled to the city. There were also confirmed cases in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan.

Information about the virus, including its exact source and incubation period, was still unknown, but researchers worldwide were scrambling to find out more. The virus caused at least six deaths in China.

Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, told the New York Times: "There are still more questions that we don’t know the answers to than things we do know. Could people with mild infections transmit this virus from person to person? That all remains still under investigation.”

Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered increased efforts to control the spread of the disease on Monday just as millions were expected to travel to the country for Lunar New Year celebrations.

Just last week, international airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York started precautionary screenings for those who recently visited the region. Entry health screenings are also being added to Atlanta and Chicago, and all passengers trying to enter the U.S. from Wuhan, China will be screened at one of these airports.

The Port of Seattle has not commented on whether it will mandate screenings for people traveling from China, but the CDC issued a level 2 alert for those traveling to and from the country.

Hospitals around the country have also begun screening individuals as person-to-person contagion is still uncertain.

The World Health Organization announced an emergency meeting on Jan. 22 to decide whether or not to classify the viral outbreak as a global health emergency.
