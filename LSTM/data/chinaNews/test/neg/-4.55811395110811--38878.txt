BOULDER, Colo. (KRDO) -- The University of Colorado at Boulder has suspended all Education Abroad-sponsored programs in China for the spring 2020 semester.

According to CU Boulder spokesperson Deborah Méndez Wilson, the decision was based on the U.S. Department of State’s Jan. 28 decision to raise the Travel Advisory Level for China to “Level 3: Reconsider travel” amidst concerns about an ongoing coronavirus outbreak.

Wilson goes on to say that two of their students were studying in Shanghai earlier this week, but both were relocated on Jan. 29 to other locations outside of China. Arrangements have been made for them to continue their coursework so they will not lose any academic credit.

CU Boulder is also working with an additional eight students who were scheduled to begin education abroad programs in China in mid-February. They have been given the option of participating in study abroad programs in other countries.

At this time, Colorado College says it has no students in China at this time and it's discussing canceling their study abroad program in China while UCCS also says it has no students currently in China.
