Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Zafar Mirza has already directed authorities dealing with airport and medical services to maintain strict vigilance at the points of entry and check travellers coming in from affected regions.

As per the directives, every passenger from China would have to pass through health counters set up at all major international airports where doctors and paramedics would inspect them through thermal body scanning machines and thermometers.

Following the standard operating procedure, the authorities immediately separated Yang from other passengers and shifted him to the Pims hospital through ambulance, the sources added.

Any suspected patient of the contagious virus is kept under observation for at least six days at an isolation ward.
