The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) says it has started investigation on the human traffickers arrested on Jan. 28.

Recall that the traffickers were arrested by officers of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) at the Seme border in Lagos State.

Mr Adekoye Vincent, an officer in the Press and Public Relations Department of the agency, disclosed this to NAN on Friday in Abuja.

Vincent, who spoke on behalf of the Director-General, Mrs Julie Okah-Donli said the agency was fully aware of the incident and was working hard through its Lagos Zonal Command to unravel the mystery about the issue.

He said that the zonal command was working in collaboration with NIS to investigate the matter with a view to fishing out the real perpetrators.

Vincent said that the agency had continued to build a mutual relationship with other sister agencies to ensure total elimination of trafficking issues in the country.

“The DG has continued to build on the existing relationship and collaboration with other agencies towards curbing human trafficking.

“Our partnership with law enforcement agencies has been cordial.

“We are working with them to ensure that those who are coming into the country through the borderline are properly profiled at various points.

“Also, in order to keep abreast of the trending issues in human trafficking, NAPTIP has continued to build the capacity of these partners by enlightening them,’’ he said.

Vincent said that the DG was at the Seme border in 2019 where she trained some law enforcement officers of both Nigeria and Benin Republic.

He said that there was enlightenment programme for people at the border community with the aim of creating awareness on human trafficking.
