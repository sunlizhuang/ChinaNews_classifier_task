Eight people were killed and dozens wounded in a series of clashes across several villages in Kazakhstan on Saturday, Interior Minister Yerlan Turgumbayev said.

The attacks took place in Kazakhstan's southern Zhambyl province, an area with a significant Dungan population, an ethnically Chinese Muslim minority group.

Security forces have restored calm in the villages, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said in a statement.

Tokayev called for an investigation and for the prosecution of individuals found to be spreading "provocative rumors and disinformation" about ethnic minorities.
