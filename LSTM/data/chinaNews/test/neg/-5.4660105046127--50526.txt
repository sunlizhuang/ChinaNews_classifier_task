A coronavirus patient quarantined in a China hospital has given birth to a baby girl who has gone on to test negative for the deadly strain.

Photos show midwives in protective hazmat overalls and masks as they deliver the baby girl before she was isolated from her mum for observation.

The mother is said to be in a stable condition at the hospital in Harbin, located in China’s most northeasterly province of Heilongjiang, reports yahoo! news.

Hospitals across China have been pushed to their limits, with videos emerging of staff breaking down after relentless shifts in a desperate bid to keep the virus at bay.

Images of a 22-year-old nurse’s badly-cut hands shared by Chinese state owned, English-language outlet China Daily, are believed to have been caused by constantly changing gloves and using disinfectant.

This latest birth comes after a mum-of-two, named only as Ms Gong, also welcomed a healthy boy on February 1 while in quarantine at Wuhan Union Hospital, having been transferred there on January 31 from Heilongjiang.

The baby's dad has tested positive for the virus, while his mum is also suspected to be infected.

Footage from the hospital, one of the facilities on the front line of the viral outbreak in Central China’s Hubei Province, shows Dr Song Bo holding the newborn boy.

The hospital’s isolation unit is the designated national location for pregnant patients diagnosed with or suspected of having the Wuhan coronavirus.

Dr Song, who is pictured wearing goggles and a full decontamination suit, said: “The patient successfully gave birth to a 3,500-gramme (7.7lb) boy.

“The child is healthy and everyone is very happy. He’s been sent to Wuhan Children’s Hospital for further tests.

“As a father-of-two myself, it’s been tough being on the front line day and night, but we’re all so excited to see this new life.

“I believe we will win the fight against this disease.”

China, meanwhile, has said it would welcome assistance from the United States to fight a coronavirus outbreak, a day after it accused Washington of scaremongering, and as the death toll in China rose on Tuesday by a new daily record to more than 420.

The death toll in China rose to 425 as of the end of Monday, up by a record 64 from the previous day, the National Health Commission said on Tuesday.

The total number of infections in China rose by 3,235 on Tuesday to 20,438, and there are at least 151 cases in 23 other countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Britain.

Japan's government said on Monday it would quarantine a Yokohama-bound cruise ship, after a Hong Kong man who sailed on it last month tested positive for coronavirus.

The first death outside of China was reported on Sunday - a 44-year-old Chinese man who died in the Philippines after travelling there from Wuhan, where the virus originated in December.

The United States, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand and Vietnam are among countries that have denied entry to foreign nationals who have recently been in China.

On Monday, a new 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan admitted its first patients - just eight days after construction on the facility began.

Huoshenshan Hospital is one of two dedicated facilities being constructed with the death toll having overtaken the SARS epidemic of 2003 - which stood at 348.

Huoshenshan, or "fire-god mountain", is designed to have 1,000 beds for patients with confirmed infections to ease a shortage of beds elsewhere in the city as the virus spreads.

Construction, which took just over a week, was copied from a hospital built in Beijing in 2003 that was dedicated to the fight against SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome.
