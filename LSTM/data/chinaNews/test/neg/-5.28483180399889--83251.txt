A local hospital in Wuhan, epicenter of the novel coronavirus pneumonia, has helped more than 60 women who have been infected or were believed to be infected with the virus to deliver babies, and none of the newborns were infected, according to the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University.

On Feb 16, for example, an infected woman surnamed Wang was given a C-section after she was sent to a quarantine ward of the hospital. Later, the 32-year-old successfully gave birth to a baby girl, even though the operation time was longer than regular cases, as the vision of doctors was affected because they were wearing protective clothing and goggles.

A test on Saturday showed that Wang is in good condition, and her baby has not been infected, according to the hospital.

More than 60 women suspected of or confirmed as having had contracted the virus have given birth at the hospital, “and we haven’t found mother-to-fetus transmission of the disease so far,” said Li Jiafu, director of the hospital’s obstetrics department.

But infection through contact between the mothers and babies will not be excluded, Li added.

Earlier this month, two newborns who were diagnosed with the infection at Wuhan Children’s Hospital, at the age of 30 hours old and 17 days old, have raised public concern about possible mother-to-fetus transmission of the disease.

But later, Wang Guiqiang, a member of the Society of Infectious Disease of the Chinese Medical Association, said that there is not sufficient data to support that conclusion.
