Pittsburgh is planning a care package for its sister city of Wuhan, China, ground zero for the deadly coronavirus that’s so far killed at least 80 people in China, Mayor Bill Peduto said Monday.

The disease has sickened nearly 3,000 people, almost all in China. About a dozen other countries have reported cases of the infection, according to news reports. More than 100 people in the United States are being tested for the infection.

Wuhan, an industrial city of 11 million people, is one of Pittsburgh’s 20 sister cities. Peduto said former Mayor Tom Murphy led a delegation there for a visit in 2002. The Sister Cities program was created to build mutually beneficial economic development opportunities among Pittsburgh and the other cities.

“Our office has reached out to the mayor of Wuhan, which is our sister city, and we have also reached out to UPMC and to the Allegheny Health Network about aiding and assisting,” Peduto said. “I think over the next two days we should be able to have a care package that has been put together.”

He said the city would consult medical experts to determine exactly what to send, but speculated it would consist of things that doctors and first responders need, such as face masks, rubber gloves and other material that could be hard to find in the future.

UPMC spokesman Paul Wood said UPMC is prepared to help.

“UPMC has a significant presence in China and has been in contact with our partners there,” he said. “We stand ready to assist them and others in China with their unmet humanitarian needs.”

Allegheny Health Network did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Peduto said he had a meeting scheduled for Monday with Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich to discuss the city’s readiness in the event of an outbreak here.

The mayor said he wanted to know what preparations public safety is making with local hospitals and what plans the city has in case of an outbreak. He also wanted to know about preparedness in the event of a scare where people start flooding city hospitals with symptoms similar to the coronavirus.

The virus presents itself with symptoms similar to a common cold or the flu, according to health officials.

Officials told the Tribune-Review last week that Pennsylvanians have little to fear at this point unless they travel to the impacted area or have been in contact with someone who has.

Pennsylvania has yet to record a confirmed case of the respiratory illness, but Philadelphia health officials are monitoring a Chinese exchange student who traveled through the Wuhan airport en route to the United States.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed five cases in the United States and investigated a total of 110 possibilities. Thirty-two of the cases turned up negative for the virus and another 73 are pending, according to the CDC.
