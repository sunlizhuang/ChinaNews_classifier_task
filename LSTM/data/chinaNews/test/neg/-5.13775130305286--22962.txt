Chinese students who travelled from the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak went clubbing in Cambridge this week, it emerged today.

Fifteen undergraduates from Wuhan College attended lectures and talks at the University of Cambridge this week as part of a nine-day education programme.

They are said to have mingled in student bars and clubs in Cambridge city centre at night - stoking fears the highly contagious illness may have already spread in the UK.

The students were able to fly from Wuhan before the city was placed on lockdown in a desperate bid to contain the lethal virus which has killed 26 people so far.

The student newspaper The Tab reported today that Cambridge Colleges have emailed students a document with advice regarding the coronavirus.

MailOnline has seen an email sent to students at Cambridge's Jesus College, where the Wuhan travellers went to, which says none of the visitors have shown any signs of infection as of yet.

On its website, Jesus College said: 'From 13-22 January 2020, Jesus College welcomed 15 visitors from Wuhan College, China, for an educational enrichment programme.

'The students experienced a range of lectures, talks and visits around the University of Cambridge, gaining insight into student life and British higher education.'

British officials yesterday warned thousands of foreign students who have gone back to China to celebrate their New Year this weekend could return to the UK unaware they have the virus.

Universities are already identifying staff and students who have recently visited the worst-hit areas, with some told that they will not be allowed back on campus unless they agree to a 'suitable quarantine period'.

Private schools, many of which also have large contingents of Chinese students, also issued guidance. China sends more pupils to UK fee-paying schools than any other country.

The Boarding Schools Association (BSA) said 'schools might wish to consider planning for the eventuality that some boarders either cannot or choose not to travel home at half-term or, more likely, Easter'.

So far more than 900 people have been infected worldwide in 10 different countries. But experts say the true number is probably closer to 10,000

While there is 'no immediate cause for concern' the situation needs to be closely monitored, independent school groups have said.

The coronavirus has so far claimed the lives of 26 people - all in China - and infected more than 900 in 10 different countries.

The World Health Organisation last night stopped short of declaring it a ‘global health emergency’, but said there was no doubt it ‘may yet become one’.

The virus – previously unknown to science – first appeared in Wuhan last month. It originated in a meat market and scientists believe it 'jumped the species barrier' from snakes, which may have been on sale illegally, to humans.

Symptoms begin with a fever, a dry cough and sneezing. This is followed by shortness of breath about a week later, which can develop into pneumonia.

All 26 deaths known about so far have occurred in China and most patients were elderly. The virus has now spread to nine countries including the US, Thailand, South Korea, Singapore and Vietnam.

Japan has recorded two cases, one of which exposes how infected travellers leaving China could be missed by health checks.

The Wuhan resident, in his 40s, developed a fever several days before his journey to Japan. But his condition then stabilised.

He reported a fever again three days after he arrived and is now in a Tokyo hospital, Japan’s health ministry said.

On Wednesday night, China suspended all flights out of Wuhan. Direct flights from the city to Heathrow were halted as a result, although there are still many flights into the UK from other Chinese cities. Currently, there are no screening measures on these flights on arrival.

Yesterday the NHS’s Chief Medical Officer wrote to hundreds of thousands of doctors and nurses advising them to establish whether patients had recently visited Wuhan. The letter said Chinese New Year celebrations could ‘amplify transition’, including within the UK, due to the ‘mass movement’ of people around the world.

University staff are worried that some of the Chinese students who will travel home this Saturday will bring the infection back.

As coronavirus has an incubation period of up to two weeks – the time between infection and symptoms beginning – they may pass it on before they even feel ill.
