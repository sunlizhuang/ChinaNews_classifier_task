Four people are being held in isolation at Glasgow’s Queen Elizabeth University Hospital awaiting test for the deadly coronavirus.

The group are being treated in Scotland for coronavirus symptoms just hours after returning from a trip to diseased Wuhan.

Reports suggest the individuals came through London to Glasgow and were flagged by authorities after developing symptoms associated with the disease.

Initial tests could not immediately isolate what the condition might be and medics are “erring on the side of caution in the meantime".

A source told the Daily Record: “There was no doubt that the situation was being taken seriously because of the symptoms being displayed and the specific origin of travel.

“The patient came through London to Glasgow and after the symptoms were flagged up no chances were taken.

“The tests that were carried out could not immediately isolate what the condition might be and it may take a bit longer to be absolutely sure what doctors are dealing with.

“Obviously they are erring on the side of caution in the meantime.”

It comes after two police stations in England were closed last night after a female Chinese detainee was brought in with flu-like symptoms.

Avon and Somerset Police said they shut two stations in Bristol as a precaution after detaining the woman.

Chinese authorities have put the region on lockdown as the virus spreads across Asia – with the death toll currently standing at 17 with hundreds of confirmed cases.

Heathrow Airport has axed all flights from Wuhan following the deadly outbreak.

There are three direct flights from the Chinese city to London every week.

A statement from the the Department of Health and Social Care said: "We have been carefully monitoring the situation in Wuhan for some time and are ready to put in place proportionate, precautionary measures.

"From today, enhanced monitoring will be in place from all direct flights from Wuhan to the UK.

"The enhanced monitoring package includes a number of measures that will help to provide advice to travellers if they feel unwell.

"For those travelling back directly from Wuhan, this includes a port health team who will meet each direct flight aircraft to provide advice and support to those that feel unwell."
