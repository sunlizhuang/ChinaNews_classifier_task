Royal Caribbean has decided to cancel all China cruises in response to the coronavirus. The decision will impact a total of eight sailings due to leave from China through March 4. Some additional Royal Caribbean itineraries will be altered to meet new restriction in place for travelers who have recently been in China. This news comes following a warning from the U.S. Department of State that citizens should not travel to China.

Royal Caribbean is introducing some mandatory precautions that apply to passengers, crew members and contractors while concern surrounding the coronavirus grows around the world. Royal Caribbean is now denying boarding to any individual who has traveled to, from or through mainland China within 15 days prior to boarding. This ban also applies to people who have been in Hong Kong. The cruise line will provide full refunds to any guests who are disqualified from boarding due to the coronavirus.

Royal Caribbean is also performing mandatory health screenings on guests who have been in contact with others who may have traveled to, from or through mainland China or Hong Kong at any point during the 15 days prior to boarding. Screenings will be mandatory for all holders of passports from China and Hong Kong. The screenings are mandatory regardless of where a guest arrived from before boarding. In addition, all guests who report flu-like symptoms will be screened.

This is still very much a developing story. Royal Caribbean will almost certainly extend its boarding restrictions and mandatory health screenings if the coronavirus is still posing a serious threat as March 4 approaches. The same is true when it comes to the many airlines from around the world that have canceled flights to China for the time being. Delta, American and United have joined international carriers like British Airways, Air France, Virgin Atlantic and Lufthansa in suspending flights to mainland China.
