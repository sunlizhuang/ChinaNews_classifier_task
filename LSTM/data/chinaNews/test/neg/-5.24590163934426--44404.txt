MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang called on the public to refrain from discriminatory behavior against visiting Chinese nationals, following official confirmation that the Wuhan coronavirus has reached the country.

“As the issue of a viral outbreak affects everyone, let us not engage in discriminatory behavior, nor act with any bias toward our fellowmen. The reality is everyone is susceptible to the virus,” Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said in a statement.

Initial concerns

“We must not stigmatize people, especially when they are at their most vulnerable, but empathize with them instead,” he also said.

The first confirmed case of the virus was a 38-year-old woman who traveled from Wuhan to the Philippines via Hong Kong.

The Philippines belatedly imposed a ban on visitors from Hubei province, China, after initial concerns early this week by the health secretary himself about the “political and diplomatic repercussions” of imposing such a ban.

Confirmation

Confirming the presence of the virus on Thursday, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III was now recommending a “restriction” on travelers from Hubei.

On Friday, the Department of Health proposed widening the ban to possibly include other areas in China affected by the virus.

There have been several reports online of misbehavior against Chinese nationals, after confirmation of the coronavirus in the country.

Pulse on China

Before that development, the Filipino pulse on China has been a subject of surveys, particularly in the context of China’s occupation of maritime areas within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.

“Let us not resort to panic, sow fearmongering or spread misinformation,” Andanar said in his statement.

He added, “Solidarity, empathy and cooperation are what we need to successfully take actions that will overcome this health concern.”
