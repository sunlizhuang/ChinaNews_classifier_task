Malacañang is concerned over the rising number of “persons under investigation” for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said yesterday. "We are looking at it with serious concern so the President has instructed DOH Secretary to study and evaluate what better procedures should be taken in order to contain, stop the coming in of this disease to the country,” Panelo said. “The idea is to secure ourselves,” he added. The Department of Health (DOH) on Tuesday announced that there are now 27 persons suspected of having nCoV after manifesting symptoms of respiratory infection and having history of travel in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the virus outbreak. Panelo reminded the public to practice safety precautions against the virus such as frequent hand-washing, avoiding symptomatic individuals, proper coughing etiquette, consuming enough water, and seeking immediate medical help when experiencing symptoms. “I talked with (Health) Sec. (Francisco) Duque. He said we don’t have to worry. If we have to make ourselves conscious of the fact that there may be some virus coming in, we have to protect ourselves by avoiding crowds, wearing masks, washing hands,” Panelo said. The DOH said the 27 persons under investigation for nCoV are all foreigners -- American, Brazilian, Chinese, and German. They were identified in Metro Manila, Western Visayas, Central Visayas, Mimaropa (Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon, Palawan), Eastern Visayas, and Northern Mindanao. Reports showed that a Chinese suspected of having the deadly virus has died at San Lazaro Hospital due to pneumonia. San Lazaro Hospital director Dr. Edmundo Lopez, however, said it was not confirmed if the 29-year-old male patient died of nCoV. Currently, there are no Filipinos suspected of having the novel coronavirus. Despite about 50 Filipino workers in Hubei province, mostly from Wuhan, having expressed desire to return home amid the nCoV outbreak, Panelo said the “best option” was for them to stay and follow Chinese health protocols. Panelo said travelling back home would further endanger Filipino workers when exposed to public places such as airports. “It might be difficult to repatriate them because we might be even risking them to contamination. So the best thing I suppose is to let them stay there and follow protocols in China,” Panelo said. Meanwhile, Panelo said he will ask the President to comment on lawmakers’ recommendation to quarantine Filipino workers who want to be repatriated. There are around 300 Filipino in Hubei province, with 150 in Wuhan City, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA). The DFA has expressed readiness to repatriate Filipinos in Wuhan and the rest of Hubei “subject to China’s rules on Disease Containment, including immigration clearance and quarantine process, among others.” Special flights have been made available to Filipino workers who wish to be repatriated. Filipinos who will arrive in the Philippines will be subjected to 14 days of quarantine as ordered by the DOH, the DFA said.*PNA back to top
