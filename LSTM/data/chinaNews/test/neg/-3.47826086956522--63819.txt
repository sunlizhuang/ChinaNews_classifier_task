Local shares finished what was Topsy Turvy start to the week with modest losses. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 fell 10.1 points, or just over 0.1 per cent, to 7012.5.

In a repeat of Friday’s trading session, the losses were once again led by energy and materials which skidded 0.9 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively. In the energy space, Woodside Petroleum slipped 0.9 per cent to $33.56 while Origin Energy fell by a larger 1.7 per cent to $7.61, seeing the broader index close at the lowest level since late October.

The losses for materials were led by Boral after the company announced its chief executive Mike Cain will step down after the release of the company’s full year results. Shares in the building materials firm tumbled 10.7 per cent to $4.60. Despite the fall, that only took them back to where they were trading a month ago.

BHP Billiton also weakened on the back of falling commodity prices and uncertainty over the outlook for Chinese demand, closing down 1 per cent at $38.40.
