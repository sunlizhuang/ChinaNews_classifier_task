Lessons aren’t just learned; they need to be taken. And it is best for everybody in the Duterte government immediately takes to heart lessons learned from the short-lived travel ban to Taiwan.

It is the general consensus government narrowly averted disaster from the Taiwan ban, with many agreeing the Duterte government should henceforth not make any “hasty ill-advised” decisions banning travel to and fro countries in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.

Considering the Taiwan issue was resolved in a matter of days, it isn’t easy to picture the consequences of the Taiwan travel ban if it had persisted.

But one very clear disastrous consequence if government had remained stubborn is the future of nearly 160,000 overseas Filipino workers (OFW) in Taiwan. Risking all their livelihood cannot be swept under the rug.

It is a puzzle how the Duterte government nearly ended up with a disaster on its hands involving thousands of Filipinos. Has this government not fully grasped the fact nowadays what constitutes our national interest in international relations almost always involves the OFW?

In fact, aside from territorial sovereignty, the OFW and his concerns dictate this country’s foreign policy.

It is obvious in the case of the short-lived Taiwan ban that top echelons of this government have not fully internalized the truism that looking out for the welfare and safety of the OFW cannot in any way be sacrificed for other political considerations like the warming relations with China or, for that matter, for any other interests of any other country.

The Taiwan travel ban came in the rush to curb the spread of COVID-19. In the wake of infections, the country earlier imposed a travel ban on China and its administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, but did not include Taiwan.

Later, a top health official said Taiwan was part of the ban, saying the Philippines recognizes it as part of China. It was inevitable for many to easily see the official ban on Taiwan as implementing Manila’s “One China” policy. China does not recognize Taiwan as an independent state, but considers it as an integral part of China. The Taiwan ban sounded as if Beijing was dictating the country’s foreign policy.

The country’s representative to Taiwan, Angelito Banayo, said the policy shift infuriated the Taiwanese government, leading Taiwan to threaten sanctions like the scrapping of visa-free privileges to Filipinos.

After public alarms sounded, the ban was lifted after top government officials said they were summarily convinced Taipei was strictly screening travelers to ensure no traveler was a virus carrier.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the lifting of the ban was purely a “public health” decision.” But he sounded hollow as his explanation came after he dismissed speculation that the government backtracked on the restriction following Taiwan’s threats.

In later developments which somehow looked as if government was salvaging its initial position, health officials also said they were planning similar bans against Southeast Asian nations which are reporting COVID-19 infections and which have large numbers of OFW.

The proposal did not sit well with other senior government officials. Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr summed up the opposition when he said “a (travel) ban should hinge not on the incidence and number of infections or fatalities but on the demonstrated capability of the state concerned to contain the disease and strictly regulate ingress and egress from its air and seaports.”

From the perspective of one looking at the capabilities of other countries against the dreaded COVID-19, Locsin’s view is accurate. But this should not in any way cloud or detract from the other important issue — the fate of the OFW in those countries.

Banayo broadly hinted the Taiwanese threats weren’t just an issue of visa-free privileges for Filipino travelers, but more about the OFW. Banayo said the lifting of the ban was heartily welcomed by OFW working in Taiwan, mainly factory workers and household helpers.

Local manpower agencies also welcomed the lifting of the ban as it meant that around 5,000 stranded OFW could immediately return back to their Taiwan jobs.

Aside from Taiwan, other OFW in Hong Kong and Macau are also clamoring for the country to lift the travel bans, with one Hong Kong-based OFW group even questioning the legality of the ban before an international court.

Should government be serious about these bans, balanced and circumspect studies are in order. Knee-jerk reactions have no place.

While it certainly did look government was able to quickly repair any damages done, it still does not sound convincing. No senior official is loudly insisting the safety and welfare of the millions of OFW come first in any relationship we have with other countries.

It is time to strongly remind this government that our country’s foreign policy is also manifestly driven by OFW concerns, a policy cemented decades ago by a singular event in Singapore.

The singular event was the hanging of Flor Contemplacion. Following public outrage, the country’s Foreign Affairs department was forced to review and then change how it conducted foreign policy by putting priority on the safety and welfare of the OFW over diplomatic niceties.

Subsequent world events, like the Gulf War, also furthered that OFW foreign policy. In fact, the Duterte government’s continuing troubles with Kuwait comes from that familiar foreign policy orientation.

The safety and welfare of the OFW then is in the national interest. It is a significant national interest which since the last century has not been changed or even modified as far as I know.

How this government manages to forget such an institutional memory, illustrated by the fact top officials were “heatedly debating” the Taiwan ban, cannot be understood. In fact, there shouldn’t have been a debate in the first place.

Being sensitive to China’s or any other country’s concerns is one thing, but it certainly can be overturned at any time once it involves sacrificing the country’s real national interests. In our present times, the welfare of the Filipino overseas worker is a sacrosanct national interest. This should be emphasized and no one should even argue against it.
