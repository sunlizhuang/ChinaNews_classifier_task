TO LITTLE SURPRISE, a compromise. On January 28th the British government announced that “high risk vendors”—code for Huawei, a giant Chinese tech company—would be allowed a substantial, but limited, role in building the country's whizzy fifth-generation (5G) mobile-phone networks. The decision will please Britain’s network operators, who like Huawei’s low prices and expertise. But it will irritate America, Britain’s closest ally, which has been pushing to have the firm frozen out on security grounds.



The issue has been bubbling for months. Last April, a leak suggested that the government, then led by Theresa May, was planning to approve Huawei's involvement, with the blessing of its security services. (The leak led to the departure of the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, although he denied having anything to do with it.) But Mrs May announced her resignation a month later, leaving the final decision up in the air. America used that time to intensify its lobbying. It has threatened to cut off intelligence-sharing. A visiting delegation of American officials declared earlier this month that it would be “madness” to let Huawei in. China, for its part, had warned of “substantial” economic repercussions had the company been banned. It seems that Boris Johnson, like Mrs May before him, has tried to split the difference.



The American government—with other sceptics, including many politicians in Britain—worries that, being Chinese, Huawei cannot be trusted. China’s government, it says, could compel it to spy, perhaps by installing software “back doors” in its equipment that would give Chinese spooks access to data flowing within. (Huawei has said, to general disbelief, that it would be able to refuse any such request.) In extremis, China might even be able to sabotage the equipment, damaging the phone network in the process. British officials say that they are aware of these risks, but that they believe they can be managed, through a combination of inspections and limits on how Huawei’s kit can be used.



Start with the inspections. British phone networks have contained Huawei equipment for almost two decades. In 2010 Britain established a dedicated centre for evaluating it. It is overseen by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), part of its main signals-intelligence agency, GCHQ. The centre strips down Huawei equipment, examining both software and hardware for anything suspicious. The lab’s reports have repeatedly accused Huawei of sloppy coding, but have so far found no evidence of deliberate subversion. (Some security experts, worried about hackers abusing accidental bugs rather than deliberate back doors, argue that similar scrutiny should be applied to other telecom-equipment vendors, such as Ericsson and Nokia.)

As a second line of defence, Britain will impose restrictions on where Huawei’s gear can be used. It will be kept out of anything deemed critical for the safety or security of phone networks, the so-called “core”. It will be banned entirely from the vicinity of sensitive sites like army bases. And it will be limited to no more than a 35% share of the radio antennas that make up the “periphery” of the phone network. The hope is that, if the worst does come to pass, such measures will limit the damage that can be done. But critics contend that, in 5G networks, the distinctions between the core and the periphery become less clear-cut.



Meanwhile, the government is keen on a more diverse supplier base. With that in mind, it says it will try to encourage new entrants to the market (in which Huawei is regarded as the leading global supplier). It will also push the adoption of more open technical standards, which would make it harder to hide malfeasance. In a blog post, Ian Levy, the technical director of the NCSC, outlined official thinking in some detail, saying that Britain had “never ‘trusted’ Huawei” and that there is more to digital security than the choice of vendor.



But the decision, which is still subject to parliamentary approval (not a foregone conclusion), is as much political as it is technical. Here the broader impact of Mr Johnson’s decision remains to be seen. Other countries, including Germany and Spain, are wrestling with similar choices. The decision marks a split in the Five Eyes, an electronic-spying pact with its roots in the second world war that comprises America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. Australia has already followed America’s lead and banned Huawei. Britain’s important role in the pact means American threats to cut off the flow of intelligence are likely to be a bluff. But Congress and the White House will be displeased; and Mr Johnson is also keen to negotiate a post-Brexit trade deal—in which Britain will be the junior partner.
