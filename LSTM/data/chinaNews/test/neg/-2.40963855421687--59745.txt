Vietnam has been preparing two military camps on the outskirts of Hanoi to quarantine 950 citizens returning from China, where the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has infected more than 31,000 people.

Of the 950 people, 150 will be isolated at the camp of the 59th Infantry Regiment in Chuong My District and the other 800 will be monitored at a military school under the High Command of Capital Hanoi in Son Tay Town.

The venues, which are located some 25 kilometers and 45 kilometers, respectively, from the heart of Hanoi, include spaces for fundamental human needs such as dining halls, bunk beds, restrooms, and gyms for physical training.

National radio Voice of Vietnam (VOV) reported that the Vietnamese will arrive at Noi Bai International Airport in Hanoi and Van Don International Airport in the northern province of Quang Ninh, stopping short of saying the time of their arrival.

All 950 of them will be quarantined for at least 14 days after entering Vietnam.

“During the quarantine, any one of them who shows symptoms of a fever will be transferred to a hospital for treatment,” VOV quoted Nguyen Viet Thang, chief medic at the High Command of Capital Hanoi, as saying.

After 14 days of isolation, those who are not infected can return home.

The novel coronavirus, which first surfaced in Wuhan in December 2019, has killed 638 people and infected over 31,400 globally as of Friday, according to the South China Morning Post.

Vietnam has confirmed 12 cases of novel coronavirus infection so far, including nine Vietnamese, one Vietnamese American, and two Chinese.

Among them, one Chinese and two Vietnamese have fully recovered and been discharged from hospital as of Thursday. They were all treated for free.
