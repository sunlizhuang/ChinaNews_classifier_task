The Lead

The Liberal government is set to introduce a bill in the House of Commons on Tuesday requiring judges in Canada to undergo training about sexual assault law, keeping a promise to revive a private members’ bill that would have legislated such actions but failed to pass in the Senate last June.

Justice Minister David Lametti, Women and Gender Equality Minister Maryam Monsef and former Conservative interim leader Rona Ambrose, who introduced the private member’s bill in the last Parliament, will speak to reporters on Tuesday morning after tabling the bill in the House to amend the Judges Act and the Criminal Code.

Ambrose’s Bill C-337, which was first introduced in February 2017, would have mandated judges in Canada to undergo training in sexual assault law, as well as education about rape myths and stereotypes about victims and the impact of trauma on memory.

When it became clear the bill wouldn’t pass the Senate in time before the end of the last Senate session, the federal Liberals promised to re-introduce it in Parliament if they were re-elected in October’s vote. Notice of the government bill appeared in the House’s order and notice paper on Monday.

In Canada

Health Canada jumpstarted an emergency advertising campaign worth $766,000 during the federal election in reaction to buzz around highly publicized vaping illnesses and a spike in the amount of young people in the country who were vaping.

Documents obtained using the federal access to information system show that deputy health minister Stephen Lucas gave the final go-ahead for the department’s public affairs and controlled substances branches to take the lead on a two-pronged social media ad campaign to warn young people of the dangers of vaping.

The Canadian government will issue an emergency order under the federal Quarantine Act, health minister Patty Hajdu says — in order to hold the citizens being evacuated from Wuhan, China at a Canadian Forces base for two weeks.

The Quarantine Act, which has existed in some form since the late 1800s, was overhauled after the SARS outbreak of 2003 in order to both follow a World Health Organization request to enhance national efforts post-SARS, and align Canada’s legislation with its obligations under the International Health Regulations — which laid out requirements like national contact points and minimum core surveillance and response capacities.

ICYMI from iPolitics

Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault says the Liberal government has “no intention” of licensing news organizations after drawing criticism for remarks he made over the weekend on the recommendations of the Yale report.

“Our government has no intention to impose licensing requirements on news organizations, nor will we try to regulate news content,” he clarified to reporters on Parliament Hill Monday morning.

The minister was responding to the Broadcasting and Telecommunications Legislative Review Panel’s report which was released last week. It’s been alternatively referred to as the Yale report after the name of the panel’s chair, Janet Yale.

On Sunday, Guilbeault said “we would ask that they would have licenses” while responding to a question about whether he agreed with the report’s recommendations on regulating websites on CTV’s Question Period.

In early December, before the holiday break, the governing Liberals tabled the supplementary estimates for the 2019-20 fiscal year, collectively seeking parliamentary approval for $4.9 billion in spending.

Around the World

Iran has ceased co-operation with Ukraine in its investigation into the downing of Ukrainian passenger jet PS752 by Iranian missiles last month. It comes after leaked remarks suggested Iran knew immediately that it had struck the plane. Ukrainian TV aired an exchange between air traffic control and a pilot who was landing as the jet crashed. The Iranian pilot allegedly states he saw a flash like missile fire in the sky, and then an explosion. (BBC News)

In Iowa, caucusgoers gathered yesterday at nearly 1,700 sites to tally support for their preferred candidates, with 41 pledged delegates up for grabs. The high-stakes contest will play major role in determining who is a legitimate contender in the race. Candidates in the crowded Democratic field had to meet an initial threshold of support at each caucus site to become viable, or saw supporters move to someone else. See the results at NBC News.

The first patients arrived yesterday at a 1,000-bed hospital built in 10 days as part of China’s sweeping efforts to fight the novel coronavirus that has spread internationally. Huoshenshan Hospital and a second 1,500-bed facility due to open this week were built by construction crews who are working around the clock in Wuhan, the central city where the outbreak was first detected in December. The Wuhan treatment centres mark the second time Chinese leaders have responded to a new disease by building specialized hospitals almost overnight, following the SARS outbreak.
