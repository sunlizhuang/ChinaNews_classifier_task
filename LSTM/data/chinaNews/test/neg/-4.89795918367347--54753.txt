Taipei, Feb. 5 (CNA) A 39-year-old man in Taoyuan who returned in late January from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak, and was subject to home quarantine for 14 days, has become the country's first person to face a fine of up to NT$150,000 (US$4,996) for breaching quarantine conditions, the city's Zhongli Police Precinct said Wednesday.

As fears continue to grow over the rapidly spreading Wuhan coronavirus, Zhongli police found via an electronic monitoring device that the quarantined man left his home Tuesday.

Police said that thanks to the device supplied by the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) to the man for electronic monitoring of his movements, they were alerted to his breach and went to his residence.

Police then pinpointed his whereabouts after reviewing surveillance video footage and other information.

The man was found to have left his home for nearly four hours and his case was transferred to the Taoyuan City Department of Public Health, according to police.

Meanwhile, the CECC said that foreign nationals holding valid Taiwanese resident visas who have traveled to China will from Thursday be able to return to Taiwan, but will be subject to a mandatory 14-day home quarantine.

Taiwan has announced a slew of measures to contain the spread of the virus, including the electronic monitoring of at least 2,400 people already under home quarantine around Taiwan.
