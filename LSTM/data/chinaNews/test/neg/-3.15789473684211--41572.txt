The three biggest U.S. airlines -- American, Delta and United -- are canceling all flights to mainland China because of the growing impact of the coronavirus outbreak.

Fort Worth-based American Airlines said Friday it is immediately canceling flights through March 27 to Beijing and Shanghai, but will keep flights to Hong Kong. Delta will suspend flights from Feb. 6 to April 30. Its last China-bound flight from the U.S. will leave Monday. United cut flights to Shanghai, Beijing and Chengdu starting Feb. 6.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration ordered a quarantine starting at 5 p.m. Sunday for U.S. citizens who traveled to China’s Hubei Province in the last 14 days, asking them to spend two weeks at March Air Reserve Base in California.

American had already canceled flights from Los Angeles to Beijing and Shanghai between Feb. 7 and March 29, but it extended that to include routes from DFW International Airport, too.

The stepped up precautions came after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Thursday night that the State Department was advising Americans not to travel to China. The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency.

There is deepening concern over the spread of the coronavirus, which is in some ways a mystery to health agencies but has killed 213 people worldwide with nearly 10,000 confirmed cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

Delta said it is continuing flights through Feb. 5 to "ensure customers looking to exit China have options to do so.” Foreign carriers British Airways and Germany’s Lufthansa also have suspended all flights to China.

On Thursday, the Allied Pilots Association representing American Airlines pilots sued the company to stop flights to China and directed its members to turn down work assignments to fly to China. The airline’s flight attendants also wanted it to halt China service.

Lori Bassani, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, said the union is pleased American is suspending China routes.

“The health and safety of our crew members and customers are always our main concern,” Bassani said in a statement. "This concern is magnified with the coronavirus, a fast-moving, possibly deadly virus that has become a worldwide concern.”

American only flies to China from DFW and Los Angeles International Airport. The CDC has started coronavirus screening for all passengers inbound from China at both those airports. American also is the only airline that flies between DFW and China.

On Friday morning, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) called on the U.S. to implement a full travel ban to China.

“Given the severity of the coronavirus in China and its rapid spread across the region, as well as the mounting public fear, it’s imperative that this disease is contained,” Cruz said in a statement. “The administration should take every precaution in preventing additional cases from arriving in the United States, including temporarily halting flights to and from China and implementing additional screening at all U.S. airports.”

Several countries such as Pakistan and Italy have also canceled flights to and from China.

There have been six confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, including one human-to-human transmission in Chicago. All other cases were passengers that had recently traveled to China.
