The public should not be afraid to eat at Chinese restaurants because of the coronavirus, a top medic said.

The message not to be fearful comes after owners claimed their businesses have been hugely impacted since the outbreak of Covid-19.

There are no confirmed cases of the deadly virus in Ireland after around 75 suspected cases here tested negative.

Director of the HSE’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre Dr John Cuddihy said: “The risk of catching this virus in Ireland is very low and the chances of picking up the virus from anybody here in Ireland is very low.

“The coronavirus is not related to any particular nationality.

“Several nationalities may have been in China and travelled back to Ireland. The virus is associated with having been in mainland China in the last 14 days.”

This week the Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed six Irish citizens were on the Diamond Princess ship docked in Japan.

More than 600 people on board have been infected with the coronavirus and two passengers have died. Two Irish-German passport holders have tested positive for the virus and are being treated in a Tokyo hospital, while four Irish citizens remain in quarantine on the ship.

The Department also said nine Irish citizens were on board the Westerdam cruise ship docked in Cambodia.

Two Irish citizens who were on that ship have since returned home and entered self-imposed isolation.

They have not tested positive for the coronavirus. Meanwhile, outgoing Health Minister Simon Harris yesterday signed the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2020 to include Covid-19 on the existing list.

This will oblige doctors to notify the HSE when a case is diagnosed.

Mr Harris said: “This measure, to include Covid-19 on the list of notifiable diseases, is common practice when dealing with a newly-emerging infectious disease. This was also done for the SARS epidemic in 2002.”

Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said: “Ireland’s public health response to Covid-19 remains unchanged. We are in a containment phase.

“Anyone returning from China in the last 14 days, and experiencing symptoms associated with Covid-19, is instructed to self-isolate and contact the health service via phone or email.”
