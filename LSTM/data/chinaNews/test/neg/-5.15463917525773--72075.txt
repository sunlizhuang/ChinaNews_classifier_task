Has panic over the coronavirus turned Chinatown in London, England, into a ghost town?

According to the Daily Mail, while the streets of the Westminster neighbourhood are usually filled to the brim with people in the evening, Thursday night was quite different. Between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. local time, there was barely anyone around.

Largely barren streets and empty restaurants in the area can be been seen in photos posted on the paper’s website. The mass exodus is presumably related to the recent coronavirus outbreak, which started in Wuhan, China.

Fear over the coronavirus caused mass amounts of people in the U.K. to get themselves tested. According to the paper, 763 people in the country got themselves tested for the virus in a single day — though none of them have the disease.

In fact, there have only been nine confirmed cases in the country — the most recent patient being diagnosed Wednesday, the paper reports. Officials reportedly said she had contracted the virus in China before coming back to the U.K.

As of last month, 2,512 Britons had reportedly been infected with the virus.
