Australia has confirmed its first case of the deadly coronavirus, the nation's health minister has announced.

According to officials, the man flew in to Mrelbourne from Guangzhou at around 9am..

He is currently in a stable condition and is being treated in an isolation room by medics.

Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said: "It is important to stress that there is no cause for alarm to the community.

"The patient is isolated and is undergoing treatment and we do not have any further suspected cases at this stage."

According to health officials, the man had been staying with family and not been out much - leading to a lessened risk to the wider community.

Victoria’s acting chief health officer, Dr Angie Bone, said: "All infection control precautions are being used both for when he has visitors, but also be healthcare scaff to protect them.

“China has been very helpful in sharing the genome sequence with us so we have a very good test and we can be absolutely categorical about whether this is the situation or not, and that is the situation in this case.”

So far 41 people have died from the virus while more than 1,000 cases have been confirmed worldwide.

None have yet been confirmed in the UK by health officials have warned it is highly likely we could be hit.

China has locked down an unprecedented 36 million people - preventing them accessing transport services.

The previously unknown strain is believed to have emerged late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in Wuhan.

The virus has created alarm, but there are still many unknowns surrounding it, such as just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people.

It can lead to pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.

Australians were urged on Saturday not to travel to the Hubei province in China, with the government issuing its most severe travel advisory.

"Strict travel restrictions have been imposed in Wuhan and a number of other cities in Hubei province," Australia's foreign ministry said in a statement.

"If you travel to Hubei province at this time you may not be allowed to depart until travel restrictions are lifted."
