China's National Health Commission has announced that as of the end-of Thursday January 30, the total number of confirmed Wuhan coronavirus cases in mainland China had risen to 9,692.

That's a jump of 1,982 from the previous day, with the total figure now far exceeding the number of cases associated with severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 -- previously among Asia's worst outbreaks.

The death toll in mainland China has now reached 213, with 42 new deaths occurring in Hubei province -- the epicenter of the outbreak, and one in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang.
