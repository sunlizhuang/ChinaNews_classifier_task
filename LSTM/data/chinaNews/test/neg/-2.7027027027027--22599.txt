LOCAL shares ended flat on Friday anud heightened worries across the globe over China’s coronavirus outbreak.

The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) inched up 7.06 points or 0.09% to close at 7,623.41. The broader all shares index gained 19.37 points or 0.43% to 4,523.57.

“Shares closed flat with some concerns regarding the severity of the Wuhan coronavirus. The World Health Organization concluded that it is now a local Chinese emergency, but the situation has not yet become a global health emergency,” Regina Capital Development Corp. Head of Sales Luis A. Limlingan said in a mobile message.

On Thursday, the WHO called the new coronavirus that killed 26 people in China “an emergency in China,” saying it was a “bit too early” to consider this a “public health emergency of international concern.”

More than 800 cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported globally. The Health department announced earlier this week that a Chinese boy traveling to Cebu City tested positive for coronavirus.









The Civil Aeronautics Board on Friday decided to suspend all flights connecting Wuhan to any point in the Philippines, with the exception of a couple charter flight operators that will be bringing back Chinese tourists to Wuhan until Jan. 27.
