QUEENS — January is the peak travel season from China to the United States because of the Chinese lunar new year.

That’s why the Centers for Disease Control are taking Thisa highly unusual step in screening passengers at three airports, including JFK, for symptoms of a mysterious new virus.

Passengers arriving from Wuhan, China will be checked for symptoms of fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. Screenings at JFK will start Friday night. So far, two people in China have died from this new virus officially called the 2019 Novel Corona Virus, while 41 others have been infected.

The most recent death happened late Thursday night.

Health officials say a 69-year-old man got sick on New Year’s Eve and tested positive for the pneumonia-like virus, dying two weeks later.

Chinese scientists say the illness is in the same family as the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome known as SARS but they say it does not appear as lethal.

The last time the CDC did routine passenger health screenings was during the 2014 Ebola outbreak.

About 100 staffers are being sent to JFK, San Francisco and Los Angeles international airports.

At least three other cases have surfaced outside of China, including one in Japan and two now confirmed in Thailand.

The World Health Organization is warning that the illness could spread and is alerting hospitals worldwide. CDC officials say people shouldn’t freak out and that more common illnesses such as the flu are much bigger threats to Americans than this new virus from China.
