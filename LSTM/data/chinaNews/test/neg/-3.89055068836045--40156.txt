More than 80 Britons on an evacuation flight from the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak are due to land in the UK this afternoon, but there have been complaints that not everyone who wanted to make the flight, did. After several delays, the flight - chartered by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) - left Wuhan at 9.45am local time on Friday, carrying 83 Britons and 27 non-UK nationals, mostly from EU countries. It is expected to arrive at the Brize Norton RAF base in Oxfordshire around 1pm. There were expected to be as many as 150 passengers from the UK on board, and several people complained that they were told too late to make it to the airport. Joe Armitt, who is on the flight, told Sky News that the "plane is very empty".

Nick House, an English teacher from Sussex, said that he was not able to make the flight because Foreign Office confirmation that his Indonesian wife could travel with him came too late. Mr House, who has been living in Wuhan for the last 18 months, lives an hour and a half from the airport, but got the go-ahead too late to arrange transportation to get there in time. Last night told The Telegraph: "We will hunker down and hope for another flight out, or just ride it out. It's been a long and draining day." But he added on Friday morning that the FCO had contacted him saying they were still trying to evacuate the family, and were speaking to French authorities about the possibility of a seat on a French plane leaving for Paris on Sunday. "It looks like we are not going to be left behind," Mr House said. "But we are emotionally wrecked." British citizen Chris Hill, who lives in Wuhan with his wife and four-year-old daughter, told PA he refused to take the offered flight as the FCO could not confirm he would be able to bring his daughter Renee with him as she is a Chinese citizen. "With the current situation and the way the FCO is handling the diplomatic side of things, I'm just losing faith," Mr Hill said. The Chinese government does not recognise dual nationality, and it is believed people with Chinese citizenship were unable to leave the affected area. PA understands the Chinese government later relaxed its policy on whether dual nationals and dependents could board the repatriation flight.

Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the UK Government will send another plane to Wuhan to rescue British citizens if necessary. He told Sky News: "The flight which is the air at the moment is not the end of our efforts. It is only one part that we are doing in order to keep people safe. We will do everything we can to ensure that every UK citizen, every UK national, every member of their family is contacted, supported. "If we need to, we will send another plane. We will be working with other countries to ensure the safety and security of every UK citizen and national." A foreign Office source close to the operation said that the UK faced "a huge logistical challenge" in trying to get everyone ready for the flight in a tight time frame. "The Chinese authorities gave us permission for the flight at very short notice," they said. "Hubei province is nine times the size of Wales. With transport locked down it's a huge logistical challenge. We have been in constant contact with British people in the area and tried our best to reach them with as much notice as possible. "We are working with international partners about what we can do to ensure the remaining Brits can be evacuated as soon as possible." Today's flight came after the UK's four chief medical officers raised the risk level of the illness from low to moderate and the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared an international public health emergency. Chinese health officials said on Friday morning the death toll in the country from the virus had risen to 213, up from 170 a day earlier, with the number of known cases rising from 7,711 to 9,692. No deaths have occurred outside China, although 82 cases have been confirmed across 18 countries. The WHO's announcement led Virgin Atlantic to suspend its flights between the UK and China for two weeks starting on Saturday. British Airways on Thursday extended its suspension of China flights until Monday. The British passengers on the evacuation flight - who have mainly been in Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province - had to sign a contract agreeing to isolation before they could board the flight, and underwent temperature checks. On arrival, they will be taken by bus to Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral for a quarantine period of 14 days, where they will be housed in an NHS staff accommodation block with access to the internet. Anyone with suspicious symptoms will be taken to the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen Hospital, which has a high-level infectious diseases unit. After the British passengers disembark at Brize, the flight will continue to Spain, where EU countries will process the non-British evacuees. "It's welcome news that our evacuation flight has now left Wuhan," Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said. "We know how distressing the situation has been for those waiting to leave. We have been working round the clock to clear the way for a safe departure. The welfare of those trapped and public safety have been our overriding priorities." On Thursday evening, WHO declared coronavirus as an international public health emergency due to fears of the virus spreading to countries with weaker health infrastructure. After British Airways extended its China flights suspension until Monday, Virgin Atlantic released a statement late on Thursday night saying its China services would cease for a fortnight after the arrival of its flight from Shanghai on Saturday. "This decision has been made with the safety of customers and staff at the front of our minds," the airline said.
