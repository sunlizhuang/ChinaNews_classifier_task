For China, democracy is the only way forward

Excerpted from the Washington Post

The new coronavirus sweeping China has produced images of a government acting with urgency: erecting hospitals almost overnight, cordoning off megacities, declaring a "people's war."

But from inside China comes a darker message. Xu Zhangrun, a professor at Tsinghua University who was punished for his unsparing critique of President Xi Jinping, declares that China has reached a dangerous dead end and the coronavirus has exposed the bankruptcy of its rulers. Xu courageously insists that democracy is the only way out.

In 2019, Xu was demoted, banned from teaching, writing and publishing. Undaunted, he has returned with an impassioned essay, translated by Geremie R. Barm� and published online, that is reminiscent of the work of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, the champion of free expression and human rights who died in a Chinese prison. Hopefully Xu will avoid the same fate.

Xu says the reform wave of recent decades is "dead in a ditch," and China "is little more than a crippled giant, that is if it can even be called a giant." He says China cannot become a global power if it remains "blatantly incapable of treating its own people properly."

The salvation, he writes, is for China to embrace constitutional democracy, allowing for a free press, freedom of assembly and association, an end to secret police surveillance, and respect for basic human rights, including the right to vote in open elections. "In the end, it is about freedom," he writes, urging the Chinese people to "rage against this injustice; let your lives burn with a flame of decency; break through the stultifying darkness and welcome the dawn."

Find common ground on cruise ships

Excerpted from The Post and Courier of Charleston, S.C.

It’s been more than a decade since Charleston and the State Ports Authority began their epic feud over the proper presence of cruise ships next to the city’s historic core. There’s been precious little progress made, and we hope that changes soon.

There’s simply too much at stake beyond the cruise business.

As the S.C. Supreme and the U.S. District courts prepare to rule on aspects of the dispute, both sides should commit to restarting a dialogue about how they can find common ground and reset the important relationship between the state agency and the city.

We don’t expect a resolution of the long-standing cruise debate would produce a clear winner or loser in this long-running dispute, partly because its complex nature includes the following issues:

• Whether there should be a legally binding penalty if the SPA exceeds its voluntary cap of no more than one cruise ship docking at a time, no more than 104 visits a year.

• Whether cruise ship passengers should be taxed more to contribute to the city, where struggles with flooding and sea-level rise have increased dramatically since the cruise ship controversy began.

• Whether the authority should take further steps to reduce cruise ship emissions while in port.

• Whether a new cruise ship terminal should be located on Union Pier, near the current, outdated facility.

As with most big disputes, there’s fault on both sides. The mayor has talked about the desirability of a new tax on cruise passengers to help pay for the city’s infrastructure needs, but he has not yet sat down personally with ports officials to make his case. The port’s leader and his board have excelled in positioning the Port of Charleston for long-term growth but have seemed insensitive at times to legitimate local concerns.

The time is right for fresh talks, especially as the Ports Authority renegotiates a long-term deal with Carnival Cruise Line, whose ship Sunshine is based here.
