France announced its sixth case of the new coronavirus this week and repatriated a planeload of its citizens from the virus-stricken Chinese city of Wuhan. But back at home, Chinese and others in the wider East Asian community there say they are becoming targets for discrimination.

Just as fast as the coronavirus is spreading, so too seems to be prejudice. In Japan, South Korea and Italy -- and now France. This week the French hashtag #JeNeSuisPasUnVirus -- I Am Not A Virus -- was trending on Twitter.

One Chinese man interviewed on France's BFMTV -- his face hidden so he wouldn't be recognized -- described walking out of a Paris gym and being accosted by teenagers, who laughed and said, "There's coronavirus coming."

Ethnic Chinese aren't the only ones being targeted. One account on social media describes a Vietnamese woman being shunned by those around her. Other East Asians say fellow passengers on public transport move away from them, or put scarves in front of their faces.
