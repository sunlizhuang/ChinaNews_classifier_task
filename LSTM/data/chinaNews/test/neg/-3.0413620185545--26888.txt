SINGAPORE — Chicago wheat slid almost 2% on Monday to its weakest in more than one week while corn fell 1% as rising concerns over a China virus outbreak triggered broad-based selling.

Soybeans dropped around half a percent to their lowest in more than six weeks.

FUNDAMENTALS

* The most-active Chicago Board of Trade wheat contract lost 1.9% to $5.62-1/2 a bushel as of 0142 GMT after falling earlier in the session to $5.61 a bushel, the lowest since Jan. 16.

* Corn gave up 1.1% to $3.83 a bushel and soybeans fell 0.5% to 8.97-1/2 a bushel, having dropped to its lowest since Dec. 12 at $8.96 a bushel earlier on Monday.

* The death toll from China’s new coronavirus grew to 80 on Monday as residents of Hubei province, where the disease originated, were banned from entering Hong Kong amid global efforts to halt the rapid spread of the outbreak.

* The number of deaths from the flu-like virus in Hubei province climbed from 56 to 76 overnight, health commission officials said, with four deaths elsewhere. The total number of confirmed cases in China had risen about 30% to 2,744.

* The virus is expected to dent growth in China, the world’s top importer of soybeans and other agricultural products, after months of economic worries over trade tensions with the United States.

* Traders and farmers continued to wait for signs of increased Chinese buying of U.S. farm goods after Beijing pledged to significantly increase imports in an initial trade deal the countries signed last week. The agreement is meant to reduce tensions after nearly two years of a tit-for-tat tariff war.

* Soybeans are the biggest U.S. crop export to China and the oilseed market has been particularly sensitive to developments in the trade dispute.

* Brazil, a rival soybean supplier, is expected to harvest a massive crop, providing stiff competition for sales to China.

* The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported total export sales of U.S. soybeans in the week ended Jan. 16 were 910,700 tonnes, in line with trade expectations for 700,000 to 1.3 million tonnes.

* Weekly U.S. wheat sales were 741,900 tonnes, near the high end of estimates for 300,000 to 800,000 tonnes, while corn sales reached 1 million tonnes, within expectations of 700,000 to 1.2 million tonnes.

* The USDA separately said private exporters sold 142,428 tonnes of U.S. corn to unknown destinations, the second announcement in as many days.

MARKET NEWS

* Shares slid on Monday as investors shunned equities on growing concerns over the scope of a China virus outbreak, with safe-haven assets such as the Japanese yen and Treasury notes in greater demand.
