HEALTH Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd expressed confidence that the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) can be beaten if an individual is healthy enough.

Speaking during the Question Hour at the House of Representatives on Wednesday, Duque said those who were healthy could withstand the deadly virus that has killed over 100 people in China where it originated and spread to other countries.

Duque warned however that those with “co-existing medical conditions like diabetes, hypertension, cancer” may cause “serious and severe complications”.





Although flu and the 2019-nCoV share similar symptoms, a severe acute respiratory infection will show in persons afflicted with the deadly disease once they are tested.

Duque said there have been no confirmed cases of nCoV-2019 in the Philippines yet although 27 people were under investigation.

He also said that the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) assured him that it would be conducting its own tests so there would be no need for foreign intervention.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been 4,593 recorded cases of the 2019 n-CoV. Of the number, 106 people have died as of January 28. LIEZELLE ROY
