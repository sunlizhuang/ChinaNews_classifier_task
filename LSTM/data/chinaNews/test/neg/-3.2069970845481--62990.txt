Although exhibitors from China – the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic – are not at the expo this year, visitors are still wary.

Greater Noida: Over the last few years, spotting people in masks has become common in Delhi-NCR. However, that happens outdoors, so it was quite a surprise spotting hundreds of people wearing face masks at the ongoing Auto Expo in Greater Noida.The cause, however, isn't pollution but the coronavirus scare. The mega automobile show sees exhibitors and visitors from across India and a lot of South East Asian countries. Although exhibitors from China – the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic – are not at the expo this year, visitors are still wary.Raman Awasthi, a Noida student, who came to the expo with his friends, told us, "All of us bought masks to wear here. There are so many people coming from all over, particularly the countries hit by the virus, that we did not want to take chances. We would have cancelled our visit had we not booked the tickets in advance."Not just visitors, many working at the expo also admitted that they were nervous. Zumur, who works at the stall of a leading automobile manufacturer, says, "My father was not too pleased with me coming here because he felt I was walking into the lion's den. I wasn't that perturbed but seeing so many people with masks makes me wonder if I should get one, too, tomorrow."The 2018 edition of the Auto Expo saw six lakh visitors across the six days and this year, the number is expected to rise.Visitors wear masks as they look at cars on display at the Auto Expo in Greater Noida
