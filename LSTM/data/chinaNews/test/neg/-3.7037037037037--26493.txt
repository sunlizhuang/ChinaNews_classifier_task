KLANG: Malaysia has no plans just yet to bar the entry of Chinese tourists, including those from Wuhan, says Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.

He said many countries were grappling with the novel coronavirus outbreak, but it had yet to reach a critical level here.

“We can’t predict at the moment. Many countries are facing the problem.

“But for now, it is not yet critical to the point where we have to stop tourism, ” he said after attending a Chinese New Year event organised by Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng and Klang Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry at the Hokkien Association Hall here yesterday.

He was responding to journalists on whether Malaysia would follow the Philippines, which is sending back Chinese tourists from Wuhan, where the outbreak started.

Dr Mahathir said it was not easy to detect or stop those infected from entering the country, “so we have to accept that complete control is not possible”.

He added that sending Chinese tourists back may not be feasible as they would come into contact with other people during the process.

“It is better to quarantine them first until they show no signs (of infection) and then send them back, ” he said.

He said Malaysia was currently ensuring that those infected with the virus were quarantined.

“We are isolating them and not allowing them to mix with other people. That is the first step but of course, other people must take preventative action as well, ” he said.

“This includes wearing masks in crowded places.”

He also said it was not viable to immediately quarantine all Chinese nationals who arrive in Malaysia.

“Visitors from China sometimes amount to two million people. Where to keep them? In cowsheds?

“Of course, it cannot be like that, ” said Dr Mahathir.

He added that Malaysian authorities would monitor tourists if they showed any sign of infection.

He said Malaysia was not familiar with novel coronavirus infections and prevention rather than treatment was a priority, as of now.

China’s move to quarantine the 11 million people from Wuhan, although drastic, showed the determination of their government to control the disease, he added.

As for Malaysians who are in China, Dr Mahathir said they would be examined to ensure that they are not infected with the virus before they are allowed to return.

Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad, who was also at the event, said necessary measures were being put in place to counter the infection, which made its way through Singapore recently.

“We are increasing the number of thermal detection scanners (at the entry points), ” he said, adding that Malaysia had to comply with World Health Organisation guidelines when making and implementing decisions.

But it was a challenge as people may generally come in without symptoms that develop much later, he noted.

“Anyhow, we will increase the number of all equipment and our paraphernalia to detect them.

“We are also having a meeting with the Home Ministry to see how we can intensify it further, ” said Dzulkefly.

He said there were now 51 thermal detection scanners at all entry points into Malaysia and that the Finance Ministry has given its commitment to provide the necessary funds to step up surveillance.
