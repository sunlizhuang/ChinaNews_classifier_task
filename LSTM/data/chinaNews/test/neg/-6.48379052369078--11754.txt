The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation has demanded that a jobless man pay HK$200,000 in compensation for vandalizing its automated teller machines.

Wong Kwui-ho, 34, had pleaded guilty to criminal damage at the bank's express banking branch in Sheung Shui last month as he was angry with the bank freezing the account of alleged protest-support fund Spark Alliance.

Fan Ling acting principal magistrate Don So Man-lung yesterday sentenced him to drug treatment for his methamphetamine addiction.

While HSBC asked him for HK$100,000 in compensation when he appeared in court last time, the bill doubled yesterday as the bank said it lost HK$200,000 due to the vandalism.

But So said a magistrate can only hand down compensation orders of less than HK$100,000. He asked the parties to reach a settlement on their own.

Wong's lawyer said outside court that HSBC may file a writ with the District Court to seek compensation or collect the amount by other means, which will be decided after discussions with the bank.

In mitigation yesterday, the lawyer said an organization, which did not wish to be named, has agreed to pay on Wong's behalf.

But sources said a volunteer of Spark Alliance, which is under investigation for money laundering, will be paying for Wong.

The lawyer said Wong has been living off his savings since the anti-extradition protests broke out in June.

Since his arrest, his mother - who suffers from high blood pressure and needs to attend medical appointments regularly - has had to rely on Comprehensive Social Security Assistance for living.

Wong is said to have realized he could not take care of his sick mother and vowed to stop participating in protests and return to the job market.

His lawyer hoped the court would not sentence him to the addiction treatment considering his sincerity and willingness to pay for the damage and quit drugs.

So, who has told Wong he "should be mentally prepared for a jail sentence," took the probation officer's suggestion and sentenced him to a drug treatment center, noting that no one was injured.

The court earlier heard that on December 30, Wong used pliers to damage two advertising boxes, five glass pieces and seven ATMs at the branch in Landmark North.

The incident was captured by a surveillance camera, and Wong also cut his right hand and left behind bloodstains.
