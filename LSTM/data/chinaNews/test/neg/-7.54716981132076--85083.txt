Due to Corona virus, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flights to Beijing were banned until March 15.

Sources said the PIAâ€™s flight closure to Beijing was decided due to the Corona virus.

On the other hand, according to spokesperson PIA, the decision on whether to extend the ban on flights to Beijing will be made next month.

It is thought that around 2500 people have been killed and 80,000 infected with Corona virus in China, while in other countries including Iran and South Korea, the virus is spreading rapidly, on which the World Health Organization has expressed its serious concern.
