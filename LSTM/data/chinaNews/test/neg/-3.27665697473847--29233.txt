EASTON – Plans have been cancelled to host a group of Chinese students at the Easton Middle School next month due to the recent outbreak of coronavirus.

The Easton Public Schools had planned to host the exchange students the week of Feb. 3.

“The recent outbreak of coronavirus in the Wuhan province of China has raised some concerns with our plans to host Chinese exchange students,” School Superintendent Lisha Cabral and EMS Principal Luke Carroll said Jan. 17 in a statement. “While health officials believe the transmission of the coronavirus from our visitors is unlikely, we have decided to suspend this year’s exchange program.

“This difficult decision was made out of an abundance of caution, putting the health and safety of our school community at the forefront.”

This would have been the third year students from China have visited Easton. Last year, 11 students from a foreign language school in Shijiazhuang, China visited EMS through an exchange program organized by BostonWise, a Cambridge-based student exchange agency.

Most were eighth-graders and stayed with Easton middle school students’ families. The visitors attended classes and after-school events as well as field trips. After Easton the students traveled to New York and Washington, DC.

The program was launched after a school principal from China visited Easton in 2017 to set up an exchange program.

“We look forward to continuing this valuable and enriching cultural exchange opportunity with our friends from Shijiazhuang in the future,” Cabral and Carroll stated.

Norton Public Schools also announced cancellation of an annual two-week exchange program with partner schools in China. With the outbreak of the coronavirus in China, five confirmed cases in the U.S., and the outbreak of the flu in Massachusetts, the decision was made to cancel the trip/exchange.

“I know that our students, host families, and staff along with the students from China were looking forward to this yearly event,” Superintendent of Schools Joseph Baeta said. “Although the visiting students are hundreds of miles away with no confirmed cases, we just thought that the safety of all was the most important.”

Coronavirus is in the same family of viruses that cause the common cold, pneumonia, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Severe cases can lead to pneumonia, SARS, kidney failure and death.

Initially detected in December in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread to other parts of Asia. There are five confirmed cases in the U.S.

So far more than 50 of the more than 2,000 people infected in China have died.
