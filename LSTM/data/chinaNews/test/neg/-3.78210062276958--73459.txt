Hong Kong's Department of Health announced that it will prosecute two people suspected of violating compulsory quarantine requirements.

In a statement released on Monday, the Department of Health said that since the compulsory quarantine began on February 8, four Hong Kong residents under quarantine have attempted to leave Hong Kong in breach of the requirements.

The Department of Health added that following investigations, the department applied to serve summons to two of the people involved. The other two people are still under investigation.

According to quarantine regulation, all travelers who have been in mainland China within 14 days preceding their arrival in Hong Kong must be subject to a 14-day quarantine.

If convicted of violating the quarantine regulation, the two Hong Kong residents face a maximum fine of $3,220 and up to six months in prison.
