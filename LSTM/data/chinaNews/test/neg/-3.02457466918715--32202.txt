Charles Lieber, chairman of the department of chemistry and chemical biology, is accused of hiding his involvement in China's Thousand Talents Plan, a program designed to lure people with knowledge of foreign technology and intellectual property to China.

Lieber was arrested early on Tuesday at his office at the Ivy League university, officials said. He remained in federal custody after a brief court appearance on Tuesday, pending a detention hearing scheduled for Thursday. A message seeking comment was left with his attorney.

Authorities also announced charges against a researcher at Boston University, who is accused of lying about her ties to the Chinese military.
