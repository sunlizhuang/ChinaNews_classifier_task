Passengers traveling to the USA from Wuhan, China, will undergo enhanced health screenings out of concern over a new coronavirus that has killed two people in Asia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday.

Screenings for 2019 Novel Coronavirus, or "2019-nCoV," will occur at New York City's JFK International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport and San Francisco International Airport. About 100 additional CDC staff will be deployed to assist with the efforts.

The CDC has conducted airport screenings only one other time: In 2014, in response to concerns over the Ebola virus.

Health officials screened thousands of passengers from three West African countries for Ebola but detected no illnesses.

The CDC said some of the dozens of patients sickened in the 2019-nCoV outbreak may have contracted the disease from other people. Most of the patients have links to a seafood and at least one animal market, where authorities suspect they contracted the disease from an animal, the CDC said, citing Chinese health officials.

Wuhan is the most populous city in central China, with about 11 million people. All three U.S. airports where the CDC will do its screenings have direct flights from Wuhan.

MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) are animal coronaviruses that evolved to infect people and caused deadly international outbreaks in 2002 and 2012. In both outbreaks, the CDC did not do airport screenings.

About 5,000 passengers will go through the process in the next few weeks, officials estimated. Multiple countries in Asia have begun screening airline passengers from central China.

Fever, cough and difficulty breathing are among the most common symptoms of the new coronavirus. Lab tests ruled out SARS and MERS, as well as a number of other possible illnesses.

The CDC described the screening measures as "proactive preparedness precautions." It said the risk from the illness to the American public is low.

Thursday, the World Health Organization reported there have been two confirmed international cases of 2019-nCoV â€“ one in Thailand and one in Japan, both from people who had traveled to Wuhan. The organization expects more cases to be reported in other countries.
