Former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden has been ordered to appear in court next week in connection with a contempt claim made against him in his ongoing child support case in Arkansas, PEOPLE confirms.

His appearance, at a Wednesday hearing in Independence County, will be his first in the case since it began last May.

Lunden Roberts, who first sued him for paternity and financial support, most recently argued he should be held in contempt by the judge for ignoring various court orders.

While paternity was settled earlier this month, following a DNA test in the fall that proved Hunter fathered a child with Roberts in 2018, the issue of child support remains pending.

Roberts has also asked the court to make Hunter pay her attorney fees.

In a motion for contempt filed this week (Roberts’ second such motion), her lawyers said Hunter has continued to refuse to provide needed discovery materials and financial records as ordered by the judge.

On Jan. 6, the judge said both Hunter and Roberts had to “comply with all pending discovery” by Jan. 16. But Roberts’ latest contempt motion states that Hunter “has failed to provide any additional discovery information of any nature” — including personal information such as his address and phone number and his previous years’ tax returns.

Hunter’s “conduct is willful and contemptuous,” Roberts’ motion states, arguing he should be found in contempt.

“The defendant continues to act as though he has no respect for this Court, its orders, the legal process in this state, or the needs of his child for support,” the contempt motion states, adding, “This is but another example of the defendant’s unnecessary actions to frustrate prompt adjudication of this matter and increase the plaintiff’s litigation costs.”

On Tuesday, the judge ordered Hunter to appear next Wednesday morning and “show cause, if any exists, as to why he should not be held in contempt for any of the alleged violations of this Court’s orders.”

His team has not yet filed a response to the contempt motion, according to online court records.

However, he vigorously denied a similar motion for contempt filed by Roberts’ attorneys in December, including denying that he had not provided required financial and tax records and said that “to the extent possible” he had been following the judge’s orders.

In that earlier response, his attorney said Robert’s contempt motion included “histrionics” and contended, in turn, that she had strategically included an exhibit in order to leak Hunter’s address to the media by putting it into the official record.

The two sides sharply disagree on whether Hunter’s intransigence is a stalling tactic — verging on contempt — or a reflection of his caution after being the target of all manner of speculation, innuendo and insult.

In December, the court ordered both Roberts and Hunter to provide five years of tax returns and five years’ worth of financial documentation for any money they’d received. Hunter had said in a November filing that he was unemployed since May.

Roberts pressed Hunter for more extensive financial records, including about businesses he had owned. She also scheduled a deposition of Hunter on Dec. 23.

But Hunter resisted, arguing that some of her requested financial and personal information was beyond the scope of what was necessary to resolve the single issue remaining in the case: how much he should pay to support the baby. He also asked for an order limiting the scheduled deposition and who would be in the room during it.

“Public disclosure of the deposition can only be for the purpose of continued annoyance or attempts to embarrass the Defendant,” Hunter’s attorney, Brent Langdon, wrote in December.

The court documents in the case outline ongoing disputes between Hunter and Roberts, including Hunter’s concern that his personal and financial information could become public as part of the suit.

A judge in the case previously ordered all financial information as well as their child’s identity be kept secret.

Hunter has some reason to be guarded: In recent months, two unrelated parties have sought to legally “intervene” in the suit, making explosive and unproven allegations about Hunter in filings with the court, all of which have since been stricken.
