SHANGHAI, Feb 11 (SMM) â€“ Most SHFE nonferrous metals opened the Tuesday trading session higher, recovering losses from the previous day, on the news that some big businesses resumed work in China after the Chinese New Year holiday.



LME base metals closed mixed on Monday. LME copper recovered 0.07%, nickel added 0.7%, tin climbed 1.2%, while aluminium fell 0.81%, zinc lost 0.53%, and lead slipped 0.72%. SHFE night trading session remained suspended in order to control the coronavirus outbreak.



Copper: Three-month LME copper relinquished gained during the daytime and closed slightly higher on the day at $5,659/mt, weighed by a rising US dollar amid fears over uncertainties of the coronavirus outbreak. Inventories at copper smelters continued to accumulate with copper stocks across SHFE-listed warehouses posting a significant buildup last week. Elevated inventories will also put downward pressure on near-term copper prices. Three-month LME copper is expected to trade between $5,640-5,690/mt today with the most-traded SHFE contract at 45,200-45,600 yuan/mt. Spot discounts are likely to deepen to 80 yuan/mt as an absence of resumption of downstream consumers drives sellers to destock.



Aluminium: Three-month LME aluminium fell for the second consecutive day given pressure from a stronger US dollar. It finished the Monday session down 0.81% at $1,707/mt. Trading range is expected at $1,700-1,760/mt today, with that for the most-active SHFE contract at 13,600-13,800 yuan/mt.

Intensified bearish prospects for the recovery of downstream producers, which could be delayed to the second half of February on virus outbreak, also depressed prices of the metal. Three-month LME zinc is seen trading between $2,130-2,180/mt today, with the most-liquid SHFE contract at 17,000-17,500 yuan/mt.



Nickel: Three-month LME nickel hovered between a broad band overnight, closing up 0.7% on the day at $12,920/mt. The rangebound trend between the five- and 10- day moving averages may continue today.



Lead: Three-month LME lead extended decline from the prior session as it came off after climbed to a session high of $1,825/mt and closed 0.72% lower on the day at $1,803/mt. It may continue to face downside potential in the near term.
