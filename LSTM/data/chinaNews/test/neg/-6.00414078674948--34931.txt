A number of global airlines, including Air India, British Airways, Lufthansa, Lion Air and Indigo airline on Wednesday suspended their flights to Chinese cities as Beijing struggled to contain the rapid spread of the coronavirus within the country.

The coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, capital of central China’s Hubei province, in December and it has now spread across the globe. In China, 132 people have died and there are at least 6,061 confirmed cases of coronavirus.

Chinese authorities are trying to contain the outbreak while other countries, including India, are working on plans to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province.

The US and Japan have already evacuated some of their citizens from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.

In London, British Airways, which operates daily flights to Shanghai and Beijing from Heathrow, announced the suspension of flights to and from mainland China “with immediate effect” until January 31 while it assesses the situation.

“We apologise to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority,” the airlines said.

In Frankfurt, Germany’s flagship carrier Lufthansa said on Wednesday that it was cancelling all its flights to China until February 9 over the coronavirus outbreak.

Other airlines, including United Airlines, Air Canada, Cathay Pacific Airways, Lion Air have already cancelled some flights to China.

Air France suspended its three weekly flights to Wuhan on January 24, but as of Wednesday morning said it was maintaining its 23 weekly flights to Beijing and Shanghai.

In New Delhi, Air India spokesperson said the national carrier is suspending its flights on Delhi-Shanghai route from January 31 to February 14.

IndiGo airlines also announced that due to the coronavirus outbreak in China, it has decided to suspend its flights on the Bengaluru-Hong Kong route from February 1 and on the Delhi-Chengdu route from February 1 to 20.

IndiGo also said that for now, it will continue to operate the Kolkata-Guangzhou flight but would monitor the situation on a daily basis.

Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday ordered the military to “shoulder responsibility” to contain the coronavirus outbreak.

President Xi, who heads the People’s Liberation Army, told the military to keep their mission firmly in mind and shoulder responsibility to make contribution to winning the battle against the novel coronavirus, which he has described as a “demon”, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Already, the military is pressing thousands of its medical personnel into Wuhan, the epicentre of the deadly virus outbreak, to assist the doctors.

Xi’s call to the military came as the number of confirmed cases of the fast spreading virus infection in mainland China reached 6,078 with 70 cases abroad, surpassing the cases witnessed during the SARS or severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, which had caused havoc in China in 2002-03. Over 800 people, mostly in China, died during the SARS epidemic.
