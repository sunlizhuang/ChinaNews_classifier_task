Chinese President Xi Jinping said Tuesday the country was waging a serious fight against the "demon" coronavirus outbreak and pledged transparency in the government's efforts to contain the disease.

This is the hotel in York where two guests who have been diagnosed with coronavirus were staying.

The two patients in England are both members of the same family and are receiving specialist NHS care.

The evacuation flight came after the UK's four chief medical officers raised the risk level of the illness from low to moderate and the World Health Organization declared an worldwide public health emergency.

"The two cases were staying in York when they became unwell".

But the death rate could yet go up if more of those in hospital die, or down if it's discovered there are many other people with mild symptoms.

On Wednesday night, the Staycity Hotel on Paragon Street, near York Barbican, was put on lockdown when a man, understood to be a Chinese national, was taken to hospital after falling ill.

"The chief medical officer's statement gives no information on where these two members of the same family acquired their infection", he observed.

'Close contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed cases.

"This tried and tested method will ensure we are able to minimise any risk to them and the wider public".

She said while staff were working to trace people who had been in contact with the pair, they did not now have "any idea" how high that number might be.

The flight, set to leave Wuhan city tonight, is expected to arrive at RAF airbase Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire, on Friday morning.

"We have been preparing for United Kingdom cases of novel coronavirus and we have robust infection control measures in place to respond immediately".

He added: "We are continuing to work closely with the World Health Organization and the global community as the outbreak in China develops to ensure we are ready for all eventualities".

The passengers are now being taken by bus to Arrowe Park Hospital, Wirral, for a quarantine period of 14 days, where they will be housed in an NHS staff accommodation block with access to the internet.
