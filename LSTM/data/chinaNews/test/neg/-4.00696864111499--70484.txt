East Asian students at Cambridge University have reported a string of attacks - physical and verbal - in the wake of the coronavirus panic.

One had her hair pulled and had ketchup hurled at her in the street.

Another was told to 'go back to your country' while a stranger demanded to know from a third if he was 'carrying viruses'.

Earlier in February, beauty blogger and entrepreneur Michelle Phan described the racist comments she's received recently.

The 32-year-old YouTuber said she had received comments from people who are "as dumb as rocks" accusing Asian people of "starting all sorts of diseases".

Reminding people that she is an American citizen, she said one person had told her Asians "eat creatures left, right and center" and one told her to "go back to eating bats".

In France, racist comments towards Asians have increased so much that the hashtag #Jenesuispasunvirus - 'I am not a virus' - is being widely used.

Robert Fullilove, professor of sociomedical sciences at New York's Columbia Medical Center, told NBC that the panic around the virus could be causing people to blame outsiders.

He said: "If anything, I am tempted to predict that xenophobia will rise in significance to precisely the degree to which our sources of information — all of them, not just media — give us stuff to panic about."

Cambridge-based summer schools with large intakes from China are 'considering their options' for this year's programmes, with one already cancelling its 2020 courses.

Students from East Asia have been the target of at least six alleged racist incidents following the coronavirus outbreak which originated in Wuhan, China, student newspaper Varsity said today.

All occurred in the last fortnight, since the virus scare began.

Yue Zhou, a Chinese national who is taking a PhD in education at Downing, was walking down Regent Street, Cambridge, last Tuesday evening when she says she felt someone pull her hair from behind.

Turning around and feeling a sticky substance on her head, she said she saw two teenage girls who had apparently thrown ketchup at her.

"At that moment I didn't really know what to do" said Yue.

She asked the girls to apologise immediately - which they did - but they did so while laughing at her, which she made her 'feel they didn't take it very seriously'.

She later discovered friends, also from the Far East, had recently had similar experiences with the two girls.

"It makes it seem like we deserve this kind of treatment" she told Varsity.

Haotian Guo, a Chinese national who is a PhD student at Emmanuel college, said he was about to sit down to eat lunch at Downing hall with Chinese friends on February 3rd.

He was told by two white students the seating space was reserved for their friend, but no one arrived as lunchtime ended.

"I cannot believe such an incident would happen to me in the university" he said.

While seated in a different place, Guo claims he overheard these students mention 'too many Chinese people' in their conversation.

After he reported it to the college, Downing Master Alan Bookbinder sent out an email the following day, branding such behaviour as 'unacceptable'.

Four days later, while he was collecting his bicycle on Mill Lane at around 2pm, Guo said a middle-aged man approached him on the street and asked 'Are you from China? Are you carrying viruses?'.

"I was appalled" Guo told Varsity. "For the Downing one, I cannot believe such an incident would happen to me in the university. I thought Cambridge students believed in equality."

While Guo says this is not his first experience with racism at the university, he now 'feels unsafe' following the incident on Mill Lane, and is adamant the coronavirus outbreak 'has inflamed, and to some extent justified' racism in Cambridge.

Three other Far East students who asked not to be named said they also felt racism has increased since the outbreak.

One was walking back to their college last week when a stranger shouted 'go back to your country' in the street.

Another student, wearing a face mask at the time, said they had sweets thrown in their face whilst walking in Market Square.

The third student last week walked into their college's MCR and found all the pins on a world map - intended for students mark their hometowns - which were ordinarily scattered around mainland China, had all been moved around Wuhan.

Speaking to Varsity, the student stressed 'the map was intended to celebrate the diversity of the college and the international backgrounds of our members'.

Cambridge Police told Varsity "Cambridgeshire Constabulary does not tolerate hate crime and all those affected should report all incidents to us.

"We have a diverse community in Cambridgeshire and we recognise that everyone should be allowed to live their lives free from harassment and the fear of hate crime."

In a statement published on the University website on Tuesday, Vice Chancellor Stephen Toope urged students and staff 'to remain respectful and supportive of those members of our community who, at what is already a time of heightened anxiety, may feel subjected to unfounded scrutiny'.

Cambridge Programmes, a summer school hosted in Churchill and Fitzwilliam colleges, which takes children aged 11-17 from around the world, has cancelled this year's programme following the WHO's announcement of a global health emergency.

"Ensuring safety is on the forefront of our minds" the programme's director and founder Rebecca Clarke told Varsity. "We're not just a commercial organisation."

She said the decision to cancel was 'best for everybody' and sent an email to around 100 applicants who had applied to take part in the course, as well as to 30-40 Cambridge students who usually act as mentors for the two-week programmes.

She added "We need to be worried - it's nonsense not to take a decision."

Though the course has a large Chinese intake, it also hosts children from countries such as Australia, and she refused to consider restricting applications to East Asian countries alone.

Other summer schools such as the smaller Granta Academy, are yet to make a decision on cancellation and are waiting to hear from their Chinese agency partners.

The University this week issued renewed guidance, urging all students and staff recently returning from the Chinese Hubei province, the virus's epicentre, to self-isolate and call 111 whether or not they display symptoms.

Those who arrived in the UK in the past two weeks from mainland China, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia,or Macau are advised to do the same if they display symptoms.
