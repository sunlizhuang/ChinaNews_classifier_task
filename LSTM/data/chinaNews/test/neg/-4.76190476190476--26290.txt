A woman who planned to visit Wuhan earlier this month has thanked her dog for chewing up her passport and scuppering her trip to the coronavirus-hit city.

The owner from Taiwan shared a pictured of her tattered passport which her pooch Kimi had bitten chunks from.

On January 13 when the hungry hound destroyed the travel document, the disgruntled woman wrote on Facebook: 'I got back to the room and found this scene!'

This meant she was unable to book flights to the Hubei province and was forced to scrap plans for her trip.

Since then, Wuhan has been placed on lock-down following the spread of the deadly coronavirus which spawned in the city.

As of Sunday, it had infected over 2,000 and killed 56 in China.

The scale of the outbreak prompted the woman to row back on her annoyance with her dog and she has now pivoted to praise it.

As Wuhan remained under quarantine, she posted: Do you guys remember the passport? Throwback: this kid is really protecting me.

'After my passport was torn apart, the virus began to go where I originally planned to go.

'I think about it now, and it's very touching. Fortunately, you blocked our trip.'

She added: 'Thanks for you protect me again. I'm so lucky to meet you in my life. Love you more my baby girl.'

Those stranded in Wuhan were dealt a further blow today after the city's mayor said they were bracing for a further 1,000 coronavirus patient.

Zhou Xianwan said officials are stepping up construction of specialised hospitals to deal with infection victims.

It came after Beijing's health minister assured face-masked reporters that authorities have cranked up efforts to stop the spread of disease after conceding their knowledge of how it mutates is limited.

Ma Xiaowei said 'it seems like the ability of the virus to spread is getting stronger' and added that the administration will continue to curb transport links and scrap planned public gatherings.

More than 2,000 people have now been infected worldwide and 56 have been killed in China, sparking President Xi Jinping to yesterday issue an unprecedented warning of a 'grave situation'.

Yet top health official Gao Fu said the coronavirus was 'not as powerful' as the SARS outbreak which rocked China in 2003, although it is becoming more contagious.

While SARS-infected people were only contagious when their symptoms were showing, coronavirus victims can infect others during their incubation period which can be up to 14 days.

Casting a large shadow over this morning's press conference was a video of nurse battling the outbreak who claimed the government is playing down the volume of the infections and said the true figure is 90,000.

But regime authorities batted back accusations of a cover-up and insisted it had 'followed the principles of openness and transparency' since the coronavirus broke out in Wuhan, Hubei province.
