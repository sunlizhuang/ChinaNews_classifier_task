A workers union warns airport security staff may walk off the job if Australia’s airports don’t do more to protect them from the deadly coronavirus.

The United Workers Union has accused airports of telling staff, including security officers, they can’t wear protective gear at work as it would make passengers feel “uncomfortable”.

It comes amid growing calls for Australia to ban flights from China in the wake of the coronavirus global emergency.

A poll by news.com.au found nine out of 10 people favoured suspending flights to and from the country.

However, speaking earlier today Foreign Minister Marise Payne said no other country had taken that step and Australia was working “step by step with authorities” to ensure it remained safe for air routes to stay open.

“We review that every single day and we will continue to do that,” Ms Payne told broadcaster Alan Jones.

“Airport staff, including officers stationed at security checkpoints and facility attendants, may have no choice but to stop work after being told they are not allowed to wear protective gear because this will make customers feel ‘uncomfortable’,” the United Workers Union said in a statement today.

“In some cases, workers who have made a request to wear a mask have been threatened with disciplinary action.

“Access to basic hygiene, such as soap, has also been identified by security workers at Sydney Airport as a major cause for concern.”

Coronavirus, which was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organisation (WHO) overnight, has claimed more than 170 lives and infected more than 8000 people worldwide.

There have been nine confirmed cases in Australia, including two people who were on a flight from Melbourne to the Gold Coast with 170 others after having recently been in virus epicentre Wuhan.

The Federal Government says it has been advised by the WHO banning flights from China was not recommended. There are no flights operating between Wuhan, where the virus originated, and Australia.

“It is appalling and dangerous that the safety of airport staff is not being prioritised because employers are worried about spooking customers,” United Workers Union spokesman for Property Services Damien Davie said.

“The coronavirus is a life-threatening disease … To threaten disciplinary action for a request to wear a mask is not only irresponsible but immoral.

“Airport staff are putting themselves at risk to make sure our airports can stay open. It’s public knowledge that a coronavirus patient has travelled on a domestic flight in Australia.

“If the health and safety needs of these workers are not met, United Workers Union will direct members to cease work even if it means grounding every flight in the country.”

‘ALL FLIGHTS MUST BE SUSPENDED’

The warning comes as the Transport Workers Union (TWU), which represents airline and airport workers, demanded the Federal Government ban flights from China over concerns about the virus spreading.

“Suspending flights originating from China may appear to be a drastic measure, but the consequence of inaction could be even more drastic,” TWU national secretary Michael Kaine said.

“Air travel is the most efficient means for the virus to spread, and already has been integral to the spread of the virus to at least 18 other countries around the world.

“Until more information about this form of coronavirus is known, then the precautionary principle must apply.

“That means taking all possible steps to contain the virus and protect the Australian community.

“All flights from China must be suspended until this disease is under control.”

The TWU said it has asked airlines, airports and aviation companies about their procedures for protecting staff and the travelling public.

However Australia’s Chief Medical Officer said a flight ban while China’s borders stayed open wouldn’t stop people from China travelling to Australia.

“Unless you lockdown exit from the country, banning flights, direct flights, doesn’t stop people coming from China,” Professor Brendan Murphy told News Corp Australia.

“They could come from all sorts of other ports and at least we know who is coming from China and we can meet and do very intensive border measures for those flights.”

Prof Murphy said many airlines that had suspended flights from China had done so for “commercial reasons”.

JONES GRILLS FOREIGN MINISTER ON AIR

Earlier today, Alan Jones demanded Foreign Minister Marise Payne explain why the government hadn’t grounded flights from China in a fiery on-air exchange.

The 2GB radio and Sky News host asked Ms Payne why Australia was still allowing up to 49,000 people from arrive from China each week, including on nine flights to Sydney on Friday alone.

Ms Payne said the government was working “step by step with authorities” who said it was still safe for planes to arrive from China.

“They have repeatedly told us that stopping all flights from China is not recommended at this stage and in fact no other country has stopped all flights from China,” Ms Payne said.

“We review that every single day and we will continue to do that.”

But Jones said he felt the “public mood” was against the government.

“At the end of the day I don’t think anyone believes that China is telling the international communities the truth,” he said.

“If every region in mainland China has confirmed cases – we are flying people out here from all of those regions.”

He added: “You can’t bring a nail file (into Australia) but you can bring a virus.”

Ms Payne said the government had worked quickly to install biosecurity screening at Australia’s airports.

For the sake of all Australians stop all flights originating from China to Australia immediately! Other countries are taking drastic action we should be doing the same AND NOW!! #closeourbordershttps://t.co/cxz8tIYFSe — Gai Reddin (@GaiReddin) January 30, 2020

Best way to stop #coronavirus spreading anymore in #Australia, is for our #government to ban all flights coming into Australian airports from #China! @ScottMorrisonMP @LiberalAus @AustralianLabor put the citizens health first!!! — DW (@danieloverheard) January 29, 2020

So the China Eastern flight that landed in Sydney must have left before the travel ban came into effect. Huge risk to Australia, especially after Macau comments on no temperature detected on infected visitors on arrival. It took several days later to show signs. — Global Travel Adventures (@Wolf_Travels) January 23, 2020

All human movements between China & Australia now need to be stopped asap. Cancel all flights. @smh @australian @guardian

@911CORLEBRA777 Australia is being slow. It must ban flights to and from China. It’s the closest Western nation and the most likely one to spread the disease — Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) January 30, 2020

Qantas says it has no plans to change its flight routes into and out of mainland China.

Virgin Australia, which does not fly to mainland China but has daily flights between Sydney and Melbourne and Hong Kong, says it is closely following advice from Australian medical authorities and the WHO about precautions to minimise risks from the virus, AAP reported.

British Airways has suspended all flights to mainland China, along with American Airlines, United Airlines, Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines and Swiss, which have done the same.

Other airlines either cancelling or scaling back services include Air Canada, Air France, Air Seoul, Air India, Asiana Airlines, Finnair, IndiGo, Jetset Asia, Egyptair and Lion Air.

Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific said it would keep flying to mainland China but slash capacity by half.

The airline said it had also stopped handing out hot towels, blankets and magazines on flights to and from mainland China until further notice in a bid to stop the spread of the virus.
