Effect emergency control measures immediately at all entry points into PNG to stop coronavirus reaching the populace, the National Doctors Association (NDA) relayed through the media to the government yesterday.

“Let’s be responsible. The coronavirus-nCoV-2019 has not reached its peak as yet. It will happen in the coming weeks therefore, our land borders, seas and air entry points must be secured and quarantined,” NDA president Dr James Naipao said.

He made this call following the outbreak of the coronavirus in China’s Wuhan city, in the Hubei province in December last year. According to regional and international reports, the viral infection has since spread to other parts of the world, including PNG’s closest neighbours Indonesia and Australia.

Dr Naipao said the spread of coronavirus has already happened globally as reported and as such, detection of symptoms to confirm the arrival of the coronavirus in PNG will be late.

It is known according to scientists dealing with this dreadful disease that symptoms appear after infection and precautionary measures must be put in place to safeguard the population of PNG.

“Our land borders, seaports and airs entry points must be secured and quarantined,” Dr Naipao said.

And he said aircraft and vessels arriving at PNG borders and entry points must also be fumigated.

“It is already spreading across the globe with confirmed cases and PNG is not immune to this virus,” Dr Naipao said.

As of yesterday, 132 confirmed deaths and 5974 positive cases have been reported in the hotspot of Wuhan city and PNG must at all cost take precautionary measures to stop this virus from entering the country.

It is believed that Port Moresby General Hospital is not equipped to handle cases of coronavirus infection and it has no specialist virology team or equipment to manage infection.

Dr Naipao said: “Our Public Health and Emergency physician experts should step in to advise the government to bring these experts in.

“World Health Organisation in PNG should not take this lightly and advise the Department of Health and the PNG government to put in place prudent measures.”

He said all expatriates and Papua New Guineans that have been in the epicenter, Wuhan City, Hong Kong and China upon arrival in PNG must be isolated, quarantined and locked down.

“They must be refused entry until all is clear. Our foreign mission in China should also step into assisting our citizens there.”
