When confusion goes viral

Movie lovers like me have been drawn irresistibly to Dark Waters, the 2019 American legal thriller that has won positive reviews from critics and accolades for lead actor Mark Ruffalo.

Based on the 2016 article "The Lawyer Who Became Dupont's Worst Nightmare" in the New York Times Magazine, the movie features the Avengers star as corporate lawyer Rob Bilott, who uncovers a dark secret that connects a growing number of unexplained deaths.

As he risks everything -- his career, his family and his life -- to expose the truth, the film documents the cover-up of information on toxic chemicals that were dumped in the US state of West Virginia, causing unexplained human and animal deaths as well as serious illnesses.

The gradual revelation of facts in the movie reminds me of what the world is worrying about right now: China's coronavirus outbreak.

The mysterious pneumonia-like virus that originated in Wuhan has so far killed more than 170 people and sickened thousands. The growing crisis in the country of 1.4 billion people could drag down a global economy that was already looking unhealthy.

Given that China is the source of roughly one-third of world economic growth, the slowdown could be felt widely. But what worries people more is a lack of information, particularly during the first days of the outbreak.

We now know that when the new virus was first identified in early December, Chinese doctors who raised concerns were "disciplined" for "rumour-mongering". As news began to spread in mid-January, the world remained uncomfortably short of facts needed to assess the dangers.

As global investors try to gauge the outlook, they are finding that one element is the same as ever in China: Information is scarce. As well, trust in the authorities is minimal. That has led some investors to unload anything that is less than a sure thing. In the current state of anxiety, any perceived lack of information tends to be seen as bad news.

Local authorities, in particular, have attracted public fury for not sharing information in a timely manner and moving too slowly in tackling the outbreak.

One woman responded angrily to a livestream of Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang on Weibo, defending his actions even as he accepted responsibility for falling short. She noted that the government had informed the World Health Organization (WHO) on Dec 31, but the Chinese public learned nothing until Jan 20.

"The Wuhan government will be condemned throughout the ages if it turns the map of China all red," she commented, referring to maps depicting the spread of the virus.

Public anger and doubts about China's response to the outbreak are understandable in light of the grim experience of 17 years ago. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) ultimately killed nearly 800 people in 2002-03. Back then, Beijing engaged in an outright cover-up for weeks. But in today's hyperconnected mobile world, there are few places for officials to hide.

In the end, Sars significantly slowed the Chinese economy, dropping the annual growth rate to 9.1% in the second quarter of 2003 from 11.1% in the previous quarter.

So the question is, has China really learned its lesson about dealing with a serious public health emergency? Transparency is critical in a world that has seen the emergence of several life-threatening illnesses in recent years, among them bird flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Zika and others.

The Western Pacific region, in particular, is where two of the last four influenza pandemics emerged. The region of 1.9 billion people, according to the WHO, has become a hot spot for outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases as well as natural disasters.

Another key concern about the current outbreak is that social media are spreading rumours and misinformation faster than viruses spread disease. Many people are no longer sure what information and sources we can trust, and that makes the situation worse than it really is.

In the state of agitation that the world is in now, we have to communicate more effectively so that we engage all relevant sectors to be better prepared to respond to health emergencies. But how willing will people be to engage and do so effectively if they don't have enough information about the situation they are in?

What we need to learn from China's epidemic is that decision-making systems have to be strengthened to ensure rapid responses. Collaboration between countries is also important because no one, even powerful countries like China, can fight the scourge of viral disease alone.
