A crisis brings out both the best and the worst in humanity, the worst being the hysteria being stirred mainly by the opponents of President Rody Duterte, blaming him for the first known case of novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection that Health Secretary Francisco Duque III revealed on Thursday.

Doomsayers in both the Senate and the House of Representatives are instigating the isolation of China and not the virus as a solution to the health crisis.

The World Health Organization (WHO) upgraded the crisis status to a global dimension by declaring the outbreak as a global health emergency, which was an acknowledgement of the risk the virus poses to countries beyond its origin in China.

As of Thursday morning, there have been more than 7,800 confirmed coronavirus infections around the world, all but 82 of which were in China. There have been 170 deaths, all in China.

Infections caused by the coronavirus, provisionally called 2019-nCoV, were first reported in December in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, though it’s possible the virus was spreading among people there even before then.

WHO, nonetheless, indicated that the best response is a more coordinated international response to the outbreak and not closing down borders as the scaremongers are calling for.

One of the simplistic solutions put forward to supposedly protect Filipinos was to set up a “Great Wall,” which would be a temporary ban on all mainland Chinese including those from Hong Kong from entering any port of the country.

The call is as bigoted as it can get as it will only fuel a spread of anti-Chinese sentiment which is already prevalent in social media.

It is even possible that those suggestions were playing for social media mileage since these were meant to ride on the heightened emotions of those worried by the Department of Health (DoH) announcement.

The Palace took a measured step of restricting travel to the Philippines from Hubei province where Wuhan City is the capital but not the entire People’s Republic of China.

Right up the “Great Wall” stupidity was the suggestion to suspend all visa issued to Chinese citizens, which would make the nation stoop to the level of the US Democrat legislators who instigated a ban on Filipino officials to pressure the government to release suspected drug trafficker detained Sen. Leila de Lima.

The opposition senators cited the unequal treatment of the DoH, which quarantines Filipinos returning from China but not the mainland visitors.

While other countries have resorted to closing their borders to restrict the spread of the virus, such a drastic solution remains uncalled for the plain reason that health authorities do not see a need for it.

The Chinese government had taken responsible steps including being totally transparent on the spread of the disease and its implications including a lockdown on affected cities that should soothe fears about a pandemic.

Apparently, the detractors of Rody have found another opening to criticize him and his independent foreign policy that cultivated friendship with China.

When the polio virus was identified to have been resurrected in the country, several nations took the step of requiring medical records from Filipinos that was very painful among the country’s migrant workers.

The call was for an international response to defeat the health crisis and not to further stoke fears that is already unreasonably disproportionate with what is actually happening.

Rody said that he will meet with medical experts to get a complete picture of the situation amid the nCoV problem.

The public should listen to authoritative voices on the issue since partisan opinions may lead to more serious problems to a worried population.
