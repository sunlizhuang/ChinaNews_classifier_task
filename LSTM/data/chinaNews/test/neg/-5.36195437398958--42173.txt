SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) â€” A San Francisco Bay Area man who became ill after returning from a trip to China has become the seventh person in the U.S. who tested positive for the coronavirus, health authorities said Friday.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Friday the Santa Clara County resident tested positive for the virus, said Sara Cody, director of the Santa Clara County Public Health Department.

The man traveled to Wuhan, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak in China, and Shanghai before returning Jan. 24 to California, where he became ill, Cody said.

The man was never sick enough to be hospitalized and "self-isolated" by staying home, she said.

The man only left home twice to seek outpatient care at a local clinic and a hospital, and public health officials are now trying to reach anyone he may have come into contact with during those times to assess whether they were exposed to the virus.

Those people, along with the few members of his household, will have to undergo a 14-day quarantine.

"Fortunately, the list of contact since his return is short," Cody said.

She said there was no risk of infection for the general public. "Although we understand this case may raise concern, it doesn't change the risk for the general public. The public at large is still at low risk," she said.

Other cases of the new pneumonia-like virus include two in Southern California, one in Washington state, one in Arizona and two in Chicago.

China on Friday confirmed nearly 10,000 cases of the virus, which can cause pneumonia and other severe respiratory symptoms. So far 213 people have died from the virus in just two months.
