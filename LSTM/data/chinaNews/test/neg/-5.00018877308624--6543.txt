The release of Human Rights Watch’s World Report 2020, which looks at the state of human rights worldwide, was meant to happen with a news conference in Hong Kong on Wednesday. According to the group, the 652-page report begins with an essay by Roth that “warns that the Chinese government is carrying out an intensive attack on the global system for enforcing human rights.” The special administrative region of Hong Kong, which exists under the rule of Beijing but theoretically has much stronger protections on free expression under the “one country, two systems” framework, has come under scrutiny in the past year.
