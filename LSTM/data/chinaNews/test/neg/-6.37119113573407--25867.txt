The Coronavirus, which originated from China, has killed 56 people and has infected over 2000 people all over the world.

Researchers believe that animals are the primary source of the outbreak.

The Wet market in Wuhan, China is selling live animals such as rats, snakes, wolf puppies, and even koalas.

According to reports, the Wuhan Wet Market was selling those meats when it was still being operated in December last year.

The Huanan Seafood Market closed on January 1, 2020.

According to reports, the illegal sales happened during the dirt-encrusted floors and walls splattered with blood as shoppers piled into the busy markets.

Images that were taken in December last year showed a number of illegal trades, which included koalas and porcupines.

It is said that the animals were placed in tiny cages.

For over $7 you could buy a penis of a crocodile and a deer penis for nearly $50.

The images that are viral on social media right now were taken prior to the closure of the market, which was done by the Chinese officials.

The images show the unsanitary conditions the animals were living in while the food emporium still traded.

The Huanan Seafood Market is now ground zero.

Gao Fu, the director of China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, blamed the Huanan Seafood Market for the outbreak of the Coronavirus.

Mr. Fu said, “The origin of the new coronavirus is the wildlife sold illegally in a Wuhan seafood market.”

Mr. Fu said the virus is adapting and mutating slowly.

The first people that got infected by the virus are believed to be workers at the Huanan Wet Market.

The World Health Organization reported that the Huanan Seafood Market, which is also referred to as the Wet Market, was closed on January 1, 2020.

The WHO said the market was closed for sanitation and disinfection.

Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and many other major or small cities have banned the sales of animals and as well as travelers to come in and go out of the cities.

Over 60 million people are currently on lockdown as China is working to stop the virus from spreading.
