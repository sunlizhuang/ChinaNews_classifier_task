THE Philippine National Police Academy (PNPA) suspended “until further notice” visits to cadets as a preventive measure against the novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV-ARD), an official said on Wednesday.

PMaj. Gen. Chiquito Malayo, PNPA Director, ordered the suspension as the government intensifies its efforts to prevent the spread of the virus that has killed one, a Chinese, in the country.

Brig. Gen. Bernard Banac, PNP spokesman, said late Tuesday night that all personnel entering PNPA’s Camp General Mariano Castañeda in Silang, Cavite, were required to wear face masks. “They are also subjected to temperature check at the gate before allowed entry,” Banac said in a statement. The unidentified fatality planed in with his girĺfriend from Wuhan, China, the center of the nCoV outbreak in late January. Both tested positive for the disease although the woman was reported to be in stable condition.

The male victim was the first nCoV death outside China in the Philippines.
