The procedure of screening and quarantine will comprise two steps, the first one being screening at the airport followed by quarantine at Manesar and if any individual is suspected to be infected, he/she will be shifted to the isolation ward at Base Hospital at Delhi Cantonment in the national capital.

Screening of the Indian nationals from Wuhan, China, at the airport will be done by a joint team of Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) and Airport Health Authority (APHO).

In the wake of the deadly outbreak of coronavirus, the evacuation process was being planned by the Indian government from the last couple of days, however, the process was sped up after the detection of the first coronavirus case in the country.

Earlier on Thursday, a youth in Kerala, who is studying in Wuhan and recently returned to India, tested positive for coronavirus. The officials have said that his condition is stable and that there is no need to worry.
