BEIJING: Beijing condemned the US State Department’s decision to designate five major Chinese news organisations that have US operations as “foreign government functionaries”.



“We urge the United States to immediately stop these ill-advised measures, and we reserve the right to take further measures in response,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said on Wednesday during the ministry’s online news conference.



The designation, which took effect immediately, will subject the media organisations – People’s Daily, Xinhua News Agency, China Radio International, China Global Television Network and China Daily – to similar rules as diplomats stationed in the country.



They will be required to report all personnel in the United States to the US State Department and register any US property holdings, whether leased or owned, according to US media reports.



Geng said that the media plays an important role in facilitating communication and understanding between the peoples of different countries.



“This is unjustified and unacceptable. We urge the United States to discard its ideological prejudice and Cold War zero-sum game mentality, and stop ill-advised measures that undermine bilateral trust and cooperation,” he said. — China Daily/ANN
