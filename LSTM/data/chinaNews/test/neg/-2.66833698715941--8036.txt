John Bercow’s memoirs, to be published next month, are entitled Unspeakable. I couldn’t have put it better myself.

The book, says Mr Bercow, will be “candid”. If so, it will, like so many of his pronouncements in the chair, involve a wilful misunderstanding of his role. The Speaker is supposed to speak solely as empowered by the whole House. Mr Bercow spoke only for a faction within it. Any revelations about the MPs with whom he dealt will add to that factionalism and will therefore, to use a parliamentary expression, be out of order.

One of Mr Bercow’s acts, in his supervision of the parliamentary estate, was to allow a shanty town of television tents to be erected on College Green opposite the Houses of Parliament. As well as blocking the public from a normal right of way, these had a seriously bad effect on national debate.

They turned the area outside Parliament into a cockpit where the media could create and film the fight. Since the television news was for the most part anti-Brexit, this weighted the contest unfairly. The false impression was given that most ordinary voters were besieging Parliament to let us stay in the EU. How sick the country grew of Steve Bray, the aptly named megaphone man in a top hat paid to denounce the referendum result.
