I’ve been reading a lot of comments lately about how the Democrats are “doing everything” to get Trump removed from office. Nothing could be farther from the truth the truth that the GOP avoids at all costs. In fact, it is Trump who has done it all, Democrats are just trying to uphold the law and make America respectable again. The fact that witnesses were not called is a complete slap in the face to all Americans. Now, Trump wants to give more tax cuts to the rich, while cutting Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. How is that being a leader? He just continues to feed his narcissistic self, and the GOP runs off the edge of the cliff like lemmings, totally oblivious to the damage being done. Have a little self-pride and respect for yourself, and come to terms with the fact you, as well as all Americans, are being used.
