(Natural News) If the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) pandemic began from an “accidental” release, it sure was a happy accident for the globalists. Everything the pandemic is achieving just happens to perfectly fit the top priorities of the globalist agenda.

Consider the following:

– The coronavirus pandemic is currently on track to infect 60% – 80% of the world population and kill up to 15% of those infected, according to an increasing number of doctors and scientists. Conservatively, this could kill up to half a billion people (500 million people), which would go a long way toward accomplishing the globalist goal of depopulation.

– All the governments of the world are going broke covering entitlement payments for retired workers, such as Medicare, pensions, social security, etc. Killing off the elderly helps governments stay functionally solvent while they continue to operate on debt. (No government has any use for a citizen after they stop paying taxes and retire.) Note carefully that this virus tends to kill the elderly while leaving working-aged citizens alive so they can continue to run the factories, pay the taxes and fund the “tax plantations” that fiscally feed governments.

– The pandemic allows governments to declare medical martial law, with gunpoint-enforced quarantines, mandatory vaccinations and government kidnapping of children from parents who refuse to go along with the medical tyranny. It’s a dream come true for the CDC and the vaccine industry.

– Simultaneously, the pandemic also allows Big Tech to justify total censorship and de-platforming of “anti-vaxxers,” who will of course be immediately blamed for every infection and every death, as soon as a commercial vaccine is available.

– The economic collapse that’s now inevitable from the pandemic’s effects on the global supply chain will cover up all the counterfeit money printing by the central banks and shift blame for the economic collapse to the virus instead of failed monetary policy. Yes, the global economy was already headed for a cascading debt collapse apocalypse, but now the governments can claim “the virus did it.”

– If they can get the virus to spread quickly enough, globalists might even be able to crash the U.S. economy in time to defeat Trump’s re-election in November, removing a key enemy of the globalists and possibly even installing Hillary Clinton as Vice President (she’s rumored to be the running mate of Bloomberg).

Make no mistake, this CoVid-19 Wuhan coronavirus outbreak is almost the perfect weapon against humanity that keeps the globalists in power and even increases their tyranny on a global scale.

It’s almost as if — dare we say — the virus was intelligently designed with these goals in mind…
