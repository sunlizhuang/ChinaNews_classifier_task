The United Nations was “deeply concerned” about North Korea resuming nuclear and missile tests amid stalled peace talks, the Russian news agency Tass reported recently.

“The Secretary-General [Antonio Guterres] very much hopes that the tests will not resume, in line with relevant Security Council resolutions,” Tass quoted a UN statement posted on its website. “Non-proliferation remains a fundamental pillar of global nuclear security and must be preserved.”

Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un announced that a “new strategic weapon” would be introduced soon, the Russian news agency reported. He stated that North Korea would keep working on strategic weapons, if the United States pushed ahead with hostile policies against Pyongyang.





Kim explained that there were no longer grounds for Pyongyang to be bound by a self-declared moratorium on intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear bomb testing, because the US continued to hold military exercises in the Korean peninsula, Tass reported.

Joint military exercises between the US and South Korea were suspended after Kim met with American President Donald Trump in Singapore, their first summit.

Meanwhile, Kim’s military program has had security implications on Russia.

The cash-strapped regime in Pyongyang has had to find other ways to fund its military spending. And one way has been to sell local fishing rights to China, pushing North Korean fishermen to venture into neighboring Japan and Russia.

Last September, Russian Federal Service border personnel arrested more than 260 North Korean fishermen in three vessels for poaching in what Moscow considers its exclusive economic zone. Russian authorities reportedly seized 30,000 squid and allegedly illegal fishing equipment.

Also in September, authorities seized another two North Korean fishing boats in internal waters in the Sea of Japan, after one of those vessels attacked a Russian patrol ship.

Several Russian patrol guards and some of the suspected poachers were reportedly injured in that incident. One of the North Koreans arrested has since died, reports said.

Security experts warn that maritime incidents involving North Korean fishermen may become more frequent as North Korea’s economy worsens.

North Korea has been suffering for some time because of crippling economic sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council. Kim has demanded that those sanctions be lifted before peace talks with the United States can resume.

Last December, he announced a “Christmas surprise” if the UN sanctions were not lifted. There were speculations that Kim might test fire a long range missile, something that North Korea has not done since a diplomatic breakthrough with the US and South Korea in 2017.

Washington and its allies continue to deny Kim’s demand, until he complies with denuclearization.

For now, there has been no surprise reveal from North Korea, but talks remain at a standstill.
