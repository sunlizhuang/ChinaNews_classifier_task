Around 7,000 people have been confined to a cruise ship held off the coast of Italy after the liner was placed on lockdown due to two suspected cases of the Wuhan coronavirus.

A 54-year-old woman from Macau was placed in isolation overnight after she reportedly came down with a fever and went to the ship's hospital. Her husband, who has shown no symptoms, was also isolated as a precaution. Three doctors and a nurse from Italy's National Institute for Infection Diseases boarded the Costa Crociere ship Costa Smeralda

"As soon as the suspected case emerged, medical staff onboard immediately activated the necessary health procedures for cases of this kind," Costa Crociere said in a statement. "Our priority is to guarantee the health and safety of our guests and team."

The couple boarded the ship in Milan after flying in from Hong Kong on Saturday, according to Italian media reports.

The ship was reportedly carrying 6,000 passengers and 1,000 crew going on a seven-day cruise. Results from tests of the couple should come in Thursday afternoon. Passengers will not be allowed to disembark from the cruise ship until the woman's test results return.

Fears over the virus have grown in recent weeks as more than 7,700 cases have been confirmed worldwide and more than 100 people have died from the fatal disease. Airlines around the world have begun cancelling flights to China as demand for air travel to China has plummeted. Air Canada announced Wednesday that it would halt all flights to Beijing and Shanghai until the end of February at the latest.

"Air Canada's last flights departing Canada will operate today and the return flights will operate from Beijing and Shanghai tomorrow, January 30, 2020," the airline said. "Affected customers will be notified and offered options, including travel on other carriers where available, or a full refund. Air Canada regrets this situation and apologizes for the serious disruption to our customers' travel plans."

British Airways has also suspended all direct flights to China through the end of February, however, limited service will be continued to Hong Kong.

American Airlines stated it too would begin suspending flights between Los Angeles and Shanghai and Beijing between Feb. 9 and Mar. 27.

Cases have been confirmed in all 31 provinces and regions in China, including Tibet. The World Health Organization said they will meet again on Thursday to determine whether they will declare Wuhan coronavirus a global health emergency.
