A plane full of evacuees from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the new coronavirus that has sickened thousands and killed several hundred, landed early Wednesday at the Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, where officials plan to quarantine the travelers for two weeks while they are monitored for symptoms.

A spokeswoman for the air base confirmed the plane was one of two that arrived from China early Wednesday, but she could not provide any more information.

Department of Defense officials said one of the planes, which were chartered by the State Department, planned to refuel at the air base before traveling to Miramar Marine Corps Air Station in San Diego, another air base selected by federal officials to provide lodging for evacuees.

It was unclear how many people would be staying at the Fairfield base for monitoring of the virus. The evacuees who remain will stay at Travis’ Westwind Inn, where they will undergo regular checks for fever and other symptoms of respiratory illness.

Evacuees arrived as the outbreak of the new coronavirus continues to grow, spreading to more than two dozen countries, including the United States.

As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 23,000 people had been infected and nearly 500 had died. Eleven cases have been reported in the United States, including four in the Bay Area.

Officials said the military bases will only provide lodging in secluded areas where base officials won’t have contact with them. Federal health officials plan to handle all care, transportation and security of evacuees.
