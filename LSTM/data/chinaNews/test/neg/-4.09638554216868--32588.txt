STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- With the latest numbers coming out of China showing the new coronavirus death toll has risen over 100, calls continued to grow for a federal emergency declaration in the U.S.

Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.) called on federal officials to declare a public health emergency that would allow the Centers for Disease Control access to $85 million for various efforts against the virus, which, as of Tuesday, has five confirmed cases in the United Stares.

“Speed is essential in dealing with infectious diseases that threaten all Americans,” he said in a Tuesday media release. "That’s why I’m calling on the Department of Health and Human Services to formally declare a public health emergency so our government can respond quickly to contain the threat.”

Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) started calls Sunday for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to declare the health emergency, which he fell short of doing at a Tuesday press conference.

The funds, secured in a budget agreement negotiated by Schumer, would provide for things like case monitoring, enhanced screenings, and public awareness campaigns. Schumer’s negotiations increased the Infectious Disease Rapid Response Reserve Fund from $50 million to the current $85 million.

“If we have learned anything from the risks that new viruses pose to public health it is that a ‘stitch in time saves nine,’ and the more we can do to be proactive, the better off the public will be,” Schumer said in a Sunday statement.

U.S. EXPANDING SCREENING

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said experts are monitoring for when an emergency designation may be needed adding that the Trump administration is expanding virus screening for travelers arriving from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak was first identified, from five to 20 U.S. airports and land crossings.

Screenings have been ongoing at Kennedy International Airport, but a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates all three local airports, said they had not yet received information as to whether Newark and LaGuardia airports would be part of the additional 15.

Federal officials did not provide a list of the ports of entry conducting screenings.

All direct flights between the U.S. and Wuhan, including those at JFK, have been cancelled as the Chinese government continues its quarantine of the city of 11,000,000 people in the country’s Hubei province.

The U.S. Department of State has issued level 4 and level 3 travel advisories for the Hubei province, and the rest of China, respectively. A level 3 advisory urges travelers to reconsider going somewhere, while a level 4 asks that they not go.

Rep. Max Rose (D-Staten Island/South Brooklyn) echoed Schumer’s and Buchanan’s calls for the federal government to declare a public health emergency Tuesday.

"Declaring a public health emergency is an important step to bring the full force of the federal government to address this outbreak,” he said.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday that the city is proceeding under the assumption that the newest strain of the virus will eventually arrive in the city.

“So we are preparing on the assumption that it’s not a question of if but a question of when we start to have cases of coronavirus here in New York City,” he said at a Brooklyn press conference.

The U.S. has repeatedly offered additional CDC assistance to China, which has more than 4,500 reported cases of the virus, either directly or through the World Health Organization. Chinese officials have not yet accepted that offer, but negotiations remain ongoing.

WHO officials also announced Tuesday that they would be sending “international experts to visit China as soon as possible” to work with Chinese officials combatting the disease.

This latest outbreak, which began in December, was caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus, which is also responsible for the SARS and MERS outbreaks of recent decades. Symptoms are flu-like, including runny nose, headache, cough, sore throat, and fever, according to the CDC.

As of Monday, 73 possible cases of the new strain are pending review by the CDC, but Azar urged calm as research into the disease and possible cases continues.

“Americans should know this is a potentially very serious public health threat, but at this point Americans should not worry for their own safety,” he said. “This is a very fast-moving, constantly changing situation.”
