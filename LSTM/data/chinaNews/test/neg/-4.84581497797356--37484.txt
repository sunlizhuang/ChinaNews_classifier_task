MANILA, Philippines – “Gobyerno talaga ang papatay sa atin.” (It’s the government that will kill us.)

On Thursday, January 30, Filipinos expressed their dismay over the Philippine government’s refusal to ban travels to and from mainland China. This, after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the Philippines’ first case of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

During the House of Representatives’ question hour on Wednesday, January 29, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III explained that the government is not yet considering imposing a travel ban on tourists coming from mainland China because “confirmed cases are not limited to China.”

“If we do this, then the concerned country – China in this case – might question why we’re not doing the same for all other countries that have reported cases of the new coronavirus. It’s very tricky… but we commit to take this into consideration,” Duque said.

Netizens slammed the decision, saying that the government’s actions – or the lack of which – would kill Filipinos faster than the virus could.

One netizen also pointed out how China would have issued a travel ban to the Philippines had it been the other way around.

Local celebrities also took to social media to speak up about the issue. On Twitter, actress Solenn Heussaff wrote, ”Why is our government still allowing flights in from China? That should have been the first action when news about this virus came out."

Meanwhile, some senators supported the call to issue a temporary travel ban to China.

"There is no hint of racism or xenophobia in this policy. This is an assertion of the national wellbeing. And an acceptance of the fact that our defenses and capacity to respond to a health emergency is not that strong," said Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto.

So far, the Philippines has only temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from Hubei province in China, whose capital city, Wuhan, is the origin of the 2019 coronavirus. – Rappler.com
