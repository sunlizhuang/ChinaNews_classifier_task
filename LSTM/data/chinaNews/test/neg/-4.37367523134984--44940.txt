The men and women who trudge through sweetly smelly feces in the cave in Yunnan, China, look like space ants. They are wrapped in plastic from top to bottom and wear face masks with filters .

The scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the responsible disease control institute want to catch bats, take blood from them and look for viruses in them. The infection control suits are essential for survival. Even then, 2012, it is clear that the animals represent a kind of reservoir for human pests.

The deadly Sars corona virus, for example, which infected 2002 guests of a hotel in Hong Kong, came from horseshoe bats -Bats , the reddish horseshoe bat. The coronavirus called 2012 probably called Mers-CoV as well. And with the current 2019 – nCoV agree 89 percent of the genetic information with the virus SL-CoVZXC 21 from horseshoe noses – the same from which Sars developed.

Small blender for virus genome

There are 102 types of horseshoe bat worldwide. You can recognize them by the round skin attachment on the nose, a funnel through which they can shoot their ultrasound waves in a targeted manner.

The Chinese researchers are looking for in the cave, in which various bat species live side by side after a particularly worrying gene snippet – the blueprint for a surface protein that made the Sars virus particularly dangerous.

What the scientists write later in their publication is a sensation: Apparently the different bat species operated while sleeping close together in the cave, a kind of virus exchange . The Sars virus was composed of two types of virus before it found its way to humans.

Evolutionary biologist Cara Brook, who researches bat infections in the University of Berkley, published in the journal “Trends in Microbiology” 2014 compiled an impressive list of human plagues that have arisen in this way: In addition to the rabies, which has been associated with 1911 knows that bats are the reservoir for new outbreaks of the deadly disease, and the feared hemorrhagic fever viruses Ebola, Marburg and Lassa apparently also have their origin in bats.

In addition, according to Brook, family tree analyzes can also trace many of the old acquaintances of mankind to bat viruses: herpes, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and influenza A.

Constant fever – this hardens the viruses and makes them so dangerous

This cannot be a coincidence, Brook says. “Bats are very special reservoirs for viruses” , she says. And has been since millions of years ago 50. “Apparently bats were the very first hosts of most of these virus families.”

That the infectious gene packages still feel so good with them today is due to the peculiarities of the animals' metabolism. Bats have an exhausting life: for the lightning-like volts they perform during their nightly flights – some fly up to 160 kilometers per hour, their hearts beat a thousand times each Minute – you need all your strength.

Therefore, they save energy wherever possible, probably also on the immune system. Your immune cells react remarkably slowly. Their strategy is clearly to have the pathogens penetrate their cells and then keep them there at bay without destroying them. This explains the amazing amount of viruses found in wholesome bats.

Tom O'Shea, bat researcher from the US Geological Survey, has another theory. He argues that the metabolic rate of flying bats is seven times higher than that of mice that run to exhaustion. It gets really warm in the bats. Fever hot. The bats have a high fever for many hours a day.

Fever is a central defense strategy against invading germs in other mammals. The viruses that permanently survive this hell kitchen can no longer be impressed by human fever temperatures. That's why, says O'Shea, bat viruses are particularly dangerous for humans .

Ebola-Zaire came in from a bat colony Liberia

This was shown for example by the Ebola virus “Zaire”, which is between 2013 and 2016 killed over ten thousand people in West Africa. It has only been clear for a few days where the pathogen came from, which had not previously occurred in this region, because Ebola was considered a Central African epidemic. In a bat colony that lives in a Liberian mine, researchers from New York's Columbia University found a snippet of the Ebola Zaire genome. It is the first trace of the origin of the epidemic .

The bat tested was a Miniopterus inflatus, a long-winged bat that was found in colonies by the hundreds in huge numbers Caves sleeps. The animals swarm out at night to catch insects. Because the Ebola sample did not come from the blood, but from the mouth of the bat, Fabian Leendertz from the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin suggests screening the prey for viruses as well. “All of this could also come from a virus-bearing insect” , he says. An interesting note: Little is known outside of mosquitoes about the spread of pathogenic viruses in insects. Horseshoe noses are also insectivores.
