At the time of writing, around 90,000 worldwide have been affected by coronavirus, with a reported 3,112 deaths across the globe.



While the majority of the cases have been in China, there have now been outbreaks in many other countries, including the UK.

It’s estimated that there have been around 51 confirmed cases of the disease in the UK, from people who have recently travelled to Italy, Germany, Iran and Japan.

We spoke to Dr Richard Dawood – a travel health and tropical diseases specialist at London’s Fleet Street Clinic – for the answers to our burning questions.

What is the coronavirus?

Dr Richard tells GoodtoKnow, “Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that includes some of the viruses responsible for the common cold.

“Mostly, these viruses attack the upper respiratory tract, causing the symptoms we are all familiar with of the common cold.”

Where has the coronavirus come from?

Dr Richard adds, “In recent years, there have been outbreaks of two viruses that have resulted from human contact with animals.

“The first of these was the virus causing SARS, which spread from members of the cat family, causing a serious outbreak originating in China in 2002 to 2003. The second was the virus causing MERS that spread from camels in the Middle East in 2008.

“This new coronavirus variant has originated from Wuhan province in central China. The outbreak has centred on a large food market in which live animals were in close contact with large numbers of people.”

What are the symptoms?

Dr Richard says, “The characteristic features of infection with this new virus are fever and infection of the lower respiratory tract – viral pneumonia.

“So person suffering from infection will have a high temperature and a cough, with shortness of breath.”

Can people in Britain still travel abroad amid the coronavirus outbreak?

With the virus now spread across many corners of the world, many people are asking whether it is safe/allowed, to travel.

And it’s a pressing issue, given planned and pre-paid-for holidays.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has issued advice about travelling abroad, and at the moment, it has only advised against travel to:

Hubei province in China

Daegu in South Korea

Mainland China that isn’t essential

Cheongdo in South Korea

Certain small towns in northern Italy – north of Pisa.

When it comes to travel to the rest of the world, at the moment, most holidays and flights are still running as normal.

However, there are of course exceptions, with countries including Australia not allowing you to enter the country if you have recently been to China.

Because travel to China is severely disrupted too, some passengers have found that flights with stop-overs in the country are disrupted too.

But given that coronavirus is developing on an hourly and daily basis, it is difficult to predict travel restrictions looking ahead. If you are worried about whether or not to cancel your holiday, or whether you will lose money if it is cancelled, Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis advises getting travel insurance ASAP, or as you book a holiday for this year. You can see more of his advice on the subject here.

Dr Richard says, “The best advice is to keep plans as flexible as possible and to be aware of updates and changes in advice published by the foreign and Commonwealth office on its website, and also the official source of health information for international travel from Public Health England.

How does the coronavirus spread?

Dr Richard says, “In general, coronaviruses are spread by airborne droplets that are exhaled or coughed out by people suffering from infection, that are either inhaled by a susceptible person, or that can contaminate hard surfaces and can then be spread by her hand hygiene. We may yet discover that there are other factors at play in this outbreak.

“Since the new coronavirus causes pneumonia, it has been speculated that it may be less easily transmissible than coronaviruses that cause upper respiratory tract infection.”

How can we protect against coronavirus?

“Sensible precautions include: careful attention to hand hygiene with frequent washing and use of hand sanitisers; and ‘social distancing’ – staying at least a metre away from anyone exhibiting cough or cold symptoms.” Dr Richard said.

“In general, face masks are only limited value: there’s no point wearing them outdoors, and if worn at all, care must always be taken when handling them after use, so as to avoid contaminating oneself.”
