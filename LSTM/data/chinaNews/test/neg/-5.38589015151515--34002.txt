PUTRAJAYA: There is no need for the government to suspend all flights to and from China in the wake of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, according to Transport Minister Anthony Loke Siew Fook.

He said at the moment, only flights for the Malaysia-Wuhan route had been suspended.

“No, I think we have not come to that stage. So far we only suspended flights to Wuhan, no flight suspensions to other cities.

“We will review the situation from time to time,” he told a news conference after chairing his ministry’s post-cabinet meeting, here today.

Yesterday, AirAsia announced the suspension of all its flights from Kota Kinabalu, Bangkok and Phuket to Wuhan, China has been extended until the end of next month. - Bernama
