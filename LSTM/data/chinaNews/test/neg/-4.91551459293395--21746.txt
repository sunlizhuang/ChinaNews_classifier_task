The idea that Canada should engage in negotiations for a “prisoner exchange” with China over the detention and possible extradition to the U.S. of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou is in a word asinine.

Suggesting that our federal government intervene and offer up Meng for the release of detained Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were arrested following her detention in Vancouver, flies in the face of the core values of our democracy.

While Meng, until, or if her lawyers can show otherwise, is lawfully before the Canadian courts on a U.S. request that seeks her extradition on a fraud allegation, Spavor and Kovrig appear to be in Chinese jails on trumped up espionage charges.

Basically, Spavor and Kovrig appear to be held as hostages for the ransom of Meng’s release.

This isn’t a case where both countries have detained government representatives who are alleged to have engaged in inappropriate spying on the others nation.

In fact, it’s not even clear the two Canadians, businessman Spavor and former diplomat Kovrig, are even being accused of acting on behalf of this nation as opposed to some other country.

If China has any legitimate reason for their arrests, it hasn’t let any Canadian official in on it.

If the two men are more than just pawns in a Chinese attempt to extort Canada into releasing one of its top corporate executives, then why haven’t officials there come out with any specific allegations of wrongdoing?

Add in the case of Robert Schellenberg, the Canadian whose 15-year sentence for drug trafficking was inexplicably changed to a death sentence in the wake of Meng’s arrest by RCMP and border officials in Vancouver.

The timing of the change in Schellenberg’s sentence suggests the Chinese are literally holding a gun to the head of a Canadian citizen to try to pressure our government to renege on our lawful agreement with the United States to arrest and conduct extradition hearings when requested.

The detention of the two Michaels is tragic for both them and their families, as is the death sentence hanging over Schellenberg — something Ottawa has been trying to rectify through proper means.

But Beijing doesn’t seem interested in following the rule of law, at least as it pertains to democratic legal principals.

Another concern is how China’s actions could impact the judge now presiding over Meng’s extradition hearing.

B.C. Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes is presumed to be impartial and immune to outside influences.

But she is human. She will, at least in the back of her mind, know her decision will have ramifications on more people than just Meng.

And that could swing her thinking in either direction.

Agreeing with Meng’s lawyers that she is unlawfully before a Canadian court could result in the speedy release of the Michaels and perhaps a commuting of Schellenberg’s death term.

Holmes might inadvertently allow that to make her more inclined to rule in Meng’s favour, or offend her to the point of her deciding against the Huawei executive.

Regardless, her ruling will be interpreted in China — where judicial independence seems limited at best — as a sign of the Canadian government’s weakness, or stubbornness, when all Holmes will be doing is fairly applying the law to the best of her ability.

And if Meng’s lawyers are successful, what impact will her release from her house arrest, or more accurately her temporary exile to an opulent Vancouver mansion, and her exit from Canada, have on China’s position regarding the three Canadian citizens?

Will Chinese officials quietly release Spavor and Kovrig and reverse the Schellenberg ruling?

Or will they decide to make Canada pay even more?

Either way, a so-called prisoner exchange is not the answer. You don’t deal with a bully by letting them do as they please.
