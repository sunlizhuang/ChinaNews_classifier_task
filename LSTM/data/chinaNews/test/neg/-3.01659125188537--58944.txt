Authorities across the nation are issuing guidelines to make people aware of this life-threatening disease and how they can keep themselves safe while also avoiding the spread of the disease.



What is Wuhan Coronavirus?

Wuhan Virus is a kind of coronavirus like SARS and MERS. Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that are normally contracted from animals (like civet cats caused SARS in China).

Even the Wuhan Virus originated from the seafood market in the city -- with most of the initial victims being either vendors or buyers at the fish market. Researchers were able to find the virus similar to the ones found in bats and snakes.

The disease spreads from human contact so for being safe from it, personal hygiene is of utmost importance. Brihanmumbai Mahanagar Palika (BMC) among other authorities across the nation has issued a set of guidelines (which are identical to what WHO has been recommending) to stay safe from the Wuhan Coronavirus. Here are the Do’s and Don’ts to prevent catching the coronavirus in India.



Do’s and Don’ts for Wuhan Coronavirus

Wash Hands Regularly

Our hands are the primary way something infected could enter our body. We eat with them, we rub our eyes, noses with them and these act as gates for the virus to enter our body and get us infected with the coronavirus. It’s strongly advised that you wash your hands for more than 20 seconds or sanitise them regularly.

Avoid Eating Halfcooked Meat

Coronaviruses come from animals. And in case you’re consuming the meat of an infected animal, if it’s not cooked well, the infection will still be active in it, and will infect your body upon entering.

If You Feel Sick, Stay Indoors

While you might think that you can work or travel with a little cold or fever, taking a day off will not only help you get healthy quicker but also save others from catching the virus you’re infected from. In case you feel severe cold or flu and have trouble breathing, head to the nearest hospital or healthcare centre.

While Sneezing, Use Handkerchief Or Tissue, Always



Whether you feel well or you don’t, make sure your mouth is covered with a handkerchief and tissue. This will prevent the respiratory droplets from entering the air and infecting others in close proximity to you. Also, once used, dispose the tissue off appropriately in a dustbin, instead of keeping it lying around your desk like a souvenier -- no one likes that.

Stay Away From People Who Look Sick/Unwell

It is strongly advised that you avoid contact or being in close proximity with people who’re unwell. Even if they don’t have the coronavirus, the infection will damage your immune system that will not keep your body ready in case you actually come across it.

Clean Commonly Used Surfaces At Home

Commonly used surfaces like door levers, armrests etc can be hotspots for germs to stay accumulated, only to infect others that come in contact with that surface. Keep such surfaces clean and tidy with the help of rubbing alcohol, disinfectants or even hand sanitisers. This will destroy the germs and not let it spread.
