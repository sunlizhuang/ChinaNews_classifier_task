CHICAGO – A second person has been diagnosed with the coronavirus in Chicago, health officials said Thursday, and it is the first U.S. case of the virus spreading person-to-person.

The second patient is the husband of a woman who caught the disease after traveling to Wuhan, China.

The latest case is the sixth in the U.S. The other five U.S. cases were travelers who developed the respiratory illness after returning to the U.S. from China. The latest patient had not been to China.

The Chicago woman came back from the central China city of Wuhan on Jan. 13, then last week went to a hospital with symptoms and was diagnosed with the viral illness. She and her husband, both in their 60s, are hospitalized. Neither has been identified.

The man was placed in isolation when he began showing symptoms Tuesday. Testing from the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed he had contracted the virus on Wednesday night.

Even with Thursday’s news, officials stressed that this is not a public health emergency at this time.

Health officials are investigating 21 possible cases of the virus in Illinois.

“The health to the general public from novel coronavirus remains low at this time,” said Dr. Allison Arwady, the commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health. “Chicago and Illinois have been building our public health preparedness systems for years. We have a solid response plan in place. There is no need for the general public to change their behavior in any way based on today’s news.”

Arwady said the second patient did not use public transportation and had not attended any large gatherings in recent weeks.

Additionally, health officials don’t believe patients are contagious until they begin to show symptoms.

After the man’s wife was diagnosed with coronavirus, officials began monitoring the man closely, along with any other contacts who might have interacted with the woman. Arwady said officials are keeping a close eye on anyone who was in close contact with both patients.

“We assess these contacts, continue to follow up with each contact every day to monitor for any new symptoms,” Arwady said. “We focus on limiting the spread of disease. We work in coordination with federal, state and many local public health partners to identify close contacts of any confirmed case, as well as the health care workers.”

A La Salle County Health Department official said the agency is briefed daily by the Center for Disease Control and the Illinois Department of Public Health and the agency is monitoring the situation closely.

“We’re in constant communication with our working partners and based on what the CDC is saying, people have developed mild to severe respiratory illness,” said Jenny Barrie, from the La Salle County Health Department.

IVCH in Peru is screening patients for signs of the virus and directing anyone who has traveled to China with these symptoms to their emergency department.

Experts have said they expected additional U.S. cases, and that at least some limited spread of the disease in the country was likely.

“We anticipated this,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University infectious diseases expert. “The kind of contact that you have in a household is very close and very prolonged. That’s the kind of circumstance where we would anticipate a virus such as this could be transmitted.”

The quick detection and isolation of the new patient shows, “the system is working,” said Schaffner, adding that he does not expect the virus to become widespread in the country.
