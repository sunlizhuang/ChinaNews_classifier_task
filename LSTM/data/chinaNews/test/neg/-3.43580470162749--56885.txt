UPDATE: Lafayette College student, hospitalized Feb. 3, does not have new Chinese coronavirus, doctor says

INITIAL POST: A Lafayette College student is hospitalized and being tested for the coronavirus from China after displaying “very minor symptoms” of a respiratory virus, the Easton school announced Wednesday in an update to the college community.

The message didn’t say if the student being tested had visited China.

It does say several members of the college community recently traveled to China. They are students who went home for winter break to Hubei Province, which is the epicenter of the virus outbreak, a college spokesman said.

They were contacted before returning and asked to visit the college health center, the spokesman said. They were screened for the virus when they got back for the spring semester, according to the email sent to students and staff from the head of Health Services. They are being monitored during the incubation period to ensure they remain healthy, the email says. They are not being isolated, the spokesman said.

The initial message was provided to lehighvalleylive.com upon request by college President Alison Byerly, but it is posted on the Bailey Health Center page on college’s website and available to the public, the spokesman explained Thursday morning.

The respiratory illness caused by the virus was first reported in late December in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new virus is a member of the coronavirus family that’s a close cousin to the SARS and MERS viruses that have caused outbreaks in the past. It spreads person to person, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

As of Thursday, “563 people had died from the virus, up from 490 people the day before, and there were 28,018 confirmed cases of infection,” according to the New York Times. There were 11 confirmed cases as of Thursday in the United States with 76 cases still pending test results, the CDC said.

Fever, cough and shortness of breath are the main symptoms and they may appear within two to 14 days of exposure, the CDC said.

On Monday, the Lafayette student was admitted “for a comprehensive evaluation of a respiratory virus. As part of that evaluation, they will be testing for" the new virus, according to the email from Dr. Jeffrey Goldstein. The email says Lafayette College consulted the Pennsylvania Department of Health and the head of epidemiology and infection control at Lehigh Valley Hospital.

The student being tested is in “very good condition," Goldstein writes.

“Based on a careful assessment of reported interaction between the student and other members of our community, public health authorities have indicated that there is a low risk to the campus," Goldstein writes.

He says it will likely be several days until test results are available and at that time he will share the information with the college community.

“We are working closely with the PA Department of Health and in the event of a positive test result we will coordinate with the DOH to assess any additional risk for individual exposures in the community,” Goldstein writes.

“Our decisions and actions are based on the most up to date guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Pennsylvania Department of Health.”

The email suggests members of the college community should read the frequently asked questions about the virus from the CDC.

Members of the college community should wash their hands with soap and water, cover their mouths with tissues or a sleeve when coughing or sneezing, clean frequently touched surfaces with germicidal wipes, stay out of public they are sick and should not touch their eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, according to the information from the college.
