Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by John Hopkins CSSE

Up to date global information and data on COVID-19

The first confirmed U.S. case of the Wuhan coronavirus, a new strain of respiratory virus, was identified on Tuesday, January 21, 2020, in Seattle, Washington. There are at least 17 cases of death due to this Wuhan coronavirus in Hubei province of China as it spreads, despite all efforts in containing it. China is halting all transport out of Wuhan. In response to this new coronavirus outbreak, a World Health Organization (WHO) committee will meet today, January 22, 2020, to discuss whether to declare the virus a “public health emergency of international concern.” According to the WHO’s procedural guidelines, the outbreak would have to rise to the level of being “an extraordinary event” that endangers international public health in order to earn that designation.

For symptoms, diagnosis, transmission, prevention & treatment of Coronavirus at CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), please click HERE.

For comparison to Influenza based on CDC data, please click HERE. (Wuhan coronavirus already has 17 deaths out of over 440 cases;therefore, 17/440=0.0386 or 3.86% mortality rate, whereas seasonal influenza in the U.S. is estimated at: 12,000/9,300,000=0.00129 or 0.129% or 61,000/45,000,000=0.00136 or 0.136% mortality rate. Therefore, one who contracts the Wuhan coronavirus is 30 times as likely to die as some one contracting annual seasonal influenze or flu.)

As the World Health Organization holds an emergency meeting on the coronavirus, a Washington state man has tested positive on his return from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak started, in the video “1st case of coronavirus confirmed in US, ABC News“, below:

The death toll in the outbreak of a new corona-virus in China has jumped to 17, with nearly 500 confirmed cases. There’s growing fear the disease could spread. And the virus is on the move. Hong Kong and Macau have confirmed infections. Other regions have also reported a handful of cases in Thailand, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan, and also the US. The World Health Organization is meeting in Geneva to decide whether to declare a global public health emergency. Health authorities have traced the virus to a seafood market in Wuhan. They’re still trying to figure out the exact source, and how it’s adapting. But they have confirmed human-to-human transmission, in the video “China’s Wuhan coronavirus: What we know so far, DW News“, below:

The World Health Organization held an emergency committee meeting on the novel strain of coronavirus on Jan. 22, in Geneva, to determine whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency and how to manage the spread of the virus, in the video “WHO convenes emergency meeting on China coronavirus outbreak“, below:

Health officials around the world are racing to gauge the danger posed by a new SARS-like virus that emerged in central China last month and spread rapidly, sickening hundreds and killing at least six, in the video “What Is Coronavirus?” below:

The Guardian’s health editor, Sarah Boseley, answers some of the most common and pressing questions surrounding the recent coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, in the video “What is the coronavirus?“, below:

China is expanding its unprecedented efforts to contain a deadly new coronavirus, imposing travel restrictions on tens of millions of people. The epicenter of the outbreak is the city of Wuhan, in Hubei province but it has now spread to at least 10 cities, all of them on lockdown. It comes as China heads into it Lunar New Year, when millions of people travel to take part in celebrations. Many of those events have now been canceled. With more than 800 infections reported, and over 25 deaths, authorities aren’t taking any chances, in the video “China puts millions under lockdown to contain Wuhan coronavirus, DW News“, below:

China has stepped up quarantine efforts to contain the Wuhan coronavirus. Travel restrictions have been imposed on more than a dozen cities on the mainland, affecting around 40 million people. The death toll has climbed to 26 and new cases have been reported in Singapore, Vietnam and Japan, in the video “China steps up quarantine efforts to contain Wuhan virus“, below:

This new coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, with at least 440 sick people in China due to this virus and additional cases reported among travelers from outside of China. Should the WHO declare a public health emergency, Dr. William Schaffner, the medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, stated, “It would substantially impede travel in and out of China for both commercial and tourist reasons. That would also suggest that other countries not accept tourists and visitors for whatever reason from China. It really inhibits a lot of commercial work. At the moment, it is a local problem with a little bit of exportation to other countries, but not in a major way.”

A new virus, originating from Wuhan in China, is quickly spreading across the country and around the world. In this video, we highlight the key things you need to know about the outbreak, and how science can help control it, in the video “What you need to know about the Wuhan Coronavirus“, below:

Three Nebraska Medicine/UNMC infectious diseases specialists discuss the novel coronavirus which originated in the Wuhan region of China. They discuss what it means that the first case of the disease has now been found in the U.S., what symptoms of the disease are, how it’s transmitted and why the flu is something we should be more concerned about, in the video “Answers About Chinese Coronavirus – Nebraska Medicine“, below:

Historically, few disease outbreaks, such as Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the influenza pandemic and Zika virus, have been serious and widespread enough to constitute an international emergency. Neither the SARS nor MERS outbreaks, in the same family as the new Wuhan coronavirus, was deemed an international emergency.

The American patient in state of Washington is a man in his 30’s who traveled to Wuhan, China, the city at the center of the outbreak. He did not visit the seafood and live animal market where the virus is thought to have originated from. He is now hospitalized and in good condition, according to the health officials in state of Washington and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

For people residing in Wuhan, China, it would be a good idea for homes to have HEPA air filters.
