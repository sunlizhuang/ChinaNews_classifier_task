The Northwestern Health Unit stresses the coronavirus is an evolving, on-going situation and information changes on a daily basis.

Acting Medical Officer of Health Dr. Ian Gemmill says they are working with their health partners to monitor the situation, stating they are are learning new things each and every day.

Local hospitals and healthcare centres have been instructed to report any signs of the possible virus and keep that person in isolation as a precautionary measure.

Residents are also urged to wear masks at health facilities if they are feeling under the weather.

Dr. Gemmill says unless you have been in direct contact with someone from Wuhan and other parts of affected China, it’s highly unlikely you have the new virus.

He believes the biggest threat to northerners right now is influenza.

“Influenza is still very active. We know that there are hundreds of thousands of cases in Canada every year. Tens of thousands of hospitalizations and 3,000 to 5,000 deaths.”

Dr. Gemmill says you should still continue to follow normal practices to protect yourself.

-Clean or sanitize your hands often

-Stay well hydrated

-Get your flu shot

-Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or sleeve

-Cough into your elbow

-Stay home when sick

-Do not visit hospitals, long term care homes or young infants when you are sick

Dr. Ian Gemmill says it’s important to be vigilant of all types of respiratory infections that may circulate our area.

“In 1965, the Surgeon General of America said the fight against communicable diseases is largely over. Well I think that’s been proved wrong, because in my experience, every couple of years there’s ether a new or

resurgent communicable disease that we need to think about.”

More than 7,700 people in China have been diagnosed with the new coronavirus and 170 of them have died.

There are three confirmed cases in Canada; two in Ontario and one in British Columbia.

Air Canada has announced it is temporarily suspending all direct flights to Beijing and Shanghai.

The federal government has issued an advisory to avoid non-essential travel to mainland China due to the coronavirus.

Air Canada operates direct flights to China from Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.

The airline says affected passengers will be offered other options or a full refund.

Canadian Border Service is screening returning travellers from high-risk locations.

Dr. Ian Gemmill will be featured on the February 2nd edition of Northwest Monitor.
