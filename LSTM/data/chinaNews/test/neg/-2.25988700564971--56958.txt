A Nebraska man is back on U.S. soil after being evacuated from China. He is spending two weeks in quarantine, but not here.

“It's been a long day but I'm very happy to be back on U.S. soil,” Charlie Wasserburger tells 6 News. Wasserburger lives in Omaha. He flew to Travis Air Force base in Sacramento, California and then to San Diego where he will stay for the next two weeks, in quarantine.

“It seemed everyone was in good health and no one was coughing or wheezing on the plane, just a few babies crying and I don't blame them, we had a long day,” Wasserburger says.

Another plane will arrive in Omaha on Friday carrying dozens of Americans from China. In the interest of protecting the public's health, those passengers will be quarantined for two weeks here at Camp Ashland.

The Iowa Department of Public Health says two Iowans are undergoing testing for the virus after returning from China. They are under voluntary home-confinement.
