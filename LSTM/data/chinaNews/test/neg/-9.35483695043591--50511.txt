Death of disabled teen after father quarantined with coronavirus in China sees two officials sacked

Updated

Two Chinese officials have been removed from office following the death of a 16-year-old boy with a disability whose father — the boy's carer — was quarantined with suspected coronavirus.

Key points: The town's Communist Party secretary and mayor have been dismissed over the case

A Government statement said local authorities had been "working improperly" in response to the outbreak

The death toll from the coronavirus has passed 400

Yan Cheng, who suffered from cerebral palsy, was found dead on Wednesday after being left home alone for six days when his father, Yan Xiaowen, visited the town health centre for a fever and was isolated by health authorities.

Chinese media reported that Mr Yan had appealed for help from local authorities, village doctors and relatives to take care of the boy, even making posts on social media appealing for help for his son who he said was left alone without food or water.

Local media reported that Mr Yan's younger son, who is also disabled, was put in quarantine along with him.

Huajiahe's local Communist Party secretary and town mayor have been dismissed over the case.

A Government statement said an investigation team concluded that local authorities "had been working improperly and in an unrealistic manner" in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

"Inaccurate work, unsatisfactory work styles and inadequate implementation of outbreak prevention and control responsibilities resulted in serious consequences," the statement said.

The death toll from the coronavirus has surpassed 400, with more than 17,000 cases confirmed worldwide.

On Sunday, the Philippines recorded the first death outside China related to coronavirus.

'Heartbreaking' situation

Cerebral palsy, which appears in earlier childhood, affects movement and co-ordination and often results in severe disability.

Mr Yan had travelled with his son from Wuhan — the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak — to the town of Huajiahe where they stayed in a Government resettlement house from January 17.

He was hospitalised on January 22 and diagnosed with coronavirus one week later and is believed to still be in isolation.

The Government report said while the boy had been visited by authorities, they had not cared for him "dutifully".

The BBC reported that the boy was only fed twice during his father's absence, but a local Government official previously denied any wrongdoing, saying they sent Mr Yan pictures when they fed his son.

"In recent days, our village committee has been engaged in protection work: the village cadres were few, but the workload is very heavy," the local Government spokesperson Wu Chengtao said in an interview with The Beijing News following the boy's death.

"However, it is definitely not true that nobody took care of him."

The boy's death was met with anger on social media.

"It could've been avoided from the start, but now it has become a tragedy," user Suzhixiayi said on Weibo.

"Isolation means to isolate danger and reduce social risks, not to isolate responsibility and humanity," said another user named Jia.

Cheng Yueliang from China's Ministry of Civil Affairs said during a recent press conference the situation was "heartbreaking".

He said local governments should do more to take care and assist people with disabilities and families in need during this difficult time.
