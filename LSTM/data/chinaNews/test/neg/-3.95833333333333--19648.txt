China is putting a lockdown on Wuhan, a city of 11 million considered the epicentre of an outbreak that has killed 17 and infected nearly 600.

Wuhan's local government shut down urban transport networks and suspended flights from 10am on Thursday, and residents were told not to leave the city "without a special reason".

A long line of cars headed out of the city on Thursday, with officials checking the temperatures of some drivers, according to images from Chinese media outlet The Paper.

Police wearing masks patrolled Wuhan's Hankou train station before the suspension came into effect.

While departures were banned, trains and planes were still heading into the city.

As of Thursday, China said the number of people infected by the coronavirus has hit 571.
