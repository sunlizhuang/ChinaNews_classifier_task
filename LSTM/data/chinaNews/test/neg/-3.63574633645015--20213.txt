HONG KONG/SINGAPORE/LONDON (Jan 23): Airports and airlines are stepping up efforts to protect staff and passengers from a deadly virus originating in Wuhan, with Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and China Airlines Ltd going as far as canceling flights in and out of the Chinese city until the end of February.

The airlines’ announcements followed a decision by the Chinese government to limit travel from Wuhan, effectively putting the city of 11 million people into lockdown. Boats and buses have also been told to divert to avoid the city, which sits on the Yangtze River. At least 17 people have died and hundreds of people have been infected by the coronavirus, which has spread to other parts of Asia and the U.S.

China said it will conduct nationwide screening and improve monitoring of transportation links for the Lunar New Year holiday, which starts Friday and is expected to see almost 80 million people take flights. Major hubs elsewhere like London Heathrow increased monitoring of passengers disembarking planes from Wuhan, the capital of central China’s Hubei province, when concern about the spread of the illness mounted Wednesday.

Here’s a look at how airports and airlines around the world are reacting:

ASIA

Hong Kong: In response to complaints from its cabin crew union about risk of “catastrophic” infection, flag carrier Cathay Pacific on Wednesday said staff could wear protective face masks on flights to China if they wanted. The airline’s unit Cathay Dragon is suspending flights to Wuhan from Friday until Feb. 29 and contacting passengers about refunds and postponed travel plans.

Taiwan: China Airlines and Mandarin Airlines Co, both operated by CAL Group, are also suspending flights to Wuhan until the end of February and assisting passengers with rebookings. Crew on the two airlines along with Tigerair Taiwan are wearing face masks while on duty, CAL said in a statement Thursday. There’s also an “appropriate quantity” of masks for passengers, it said.

“Some say if 1 layer of mask doesn’t work, we should wear 2 layers.”
