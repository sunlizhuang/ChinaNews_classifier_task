IN 1997, non-lawyer Fidel V. Ramos entered into water deals with responsible businessmen, following CSW — complete staff work, his signature — guided, if my memory is true, by then-presidential legal counsel Rene Cayetano, Deputy Executive Secretary Rene Corona, Solicitor General Silvestre “Bebot” Bello 3rd and Justice Secretary Teofisto “Tito” Guingona, who had drafted the contract. Good legal minds.

Should all five (the Renes are gone — to a better world) be slapped in public by Digong or charged with no-bail plunder for the “onerous terms” in what is now treated as some functional equivalent of a “yellow dog contract”?





I can understand why current Justice Secretary Meynardo Guevarra is being cautious; he mentions talks that could last six months. He natcherly wants to land on the right side of history and not be lumped with the lawyers of Hitler’s time who disgraced the profession by blindly following the Fuhrer. He knows contracts cannot just be impaired under the Constitution. He does not want another future Prez Rant-Rant-Rant Alboroto to slap him in public and charge him with plunder (or economic sabotage, which alleged crime I cannot find in my law books).

Puzzling mixed metaphor

Digong told investors who would like to get out of the Philippines that they could do so, which is fine, but, he strangely added, “be my guest.” This, I find beyond my limited intellectual reach. A puzzling mixed metaphor, “get out” but “welcome?” — or a Kantian antonym, in an administration increasingly difficult to comprehend.

As in its slamming and shaming every critic as Yellow. I am proud to be one myself, and always will. But, not all critics are necessarily Yellows who the administration keeps lumping together. All of us may only be united in hoping for a better life for our people mired in massive poverty (but differ on solutions) and other problems.

Also, in hoping that the Prez will stop commenting on the supposed guilt of Sen. Leila de Lima or of any accused, for that matter. Americans blasted Nixon in 1970 for condemning Charles Manson & Co. for the heinous rape-murder of Sharon Tate, et al. Criticized, the White House quickly apologized for the unfair prejudgment.

Here, revered Chief Justice Roberto “Berting” Concepcion stressed that any attempt to influence court action by extrajudicial prejudicial statements may constitute contempt of court. e.g., Tolentino v. Comelec, 149 Phil. Reports 278 (1971). In the US, presidents don’t comment on pending criminal cases, to avoid a mistrial, nor tell them what not to touch; here, thou-shalt-not stop infrastructure projects and no whimper from a terrorized judiciary. No Lord Coke saying he will do what becomes him as a judge.

True Yellow

If branding matters, a true Yellow would be one who between Sept. 23, 1972 and Feb. 25, 1986, openly fought the dictatorship, or discreetly supported the opposition in a meaningful and even risky way, such as the courageous patriot Al Yuchengco. Jimmy Ongpin and Tony Gonzalez openly resisted. All Yellows, in my eyes.

One who opposes Duterte is not necessarily a Yellow and should not be lumped together with the Aquinos, Tañadas and those named above, et al. And the administration should unite and heal wounds, not divide and balkanize the country. Or label its critics, pejoratively.

FVR can be said to have become an authentic Yellow on Feb. 22, 1986 by putting his very own life on the line, crossing from the wrong side of Edsa, along with Manong Johnny Ponce Enrile (JPE), who presided masterfully in a historic impeachment trial. However, JPE has remained anti-Yellow in many ways. More constant was the mother of the incumbent Prez, Soledad, with whom we marched in Davao after the Aug. 21, 1983 salvaging of Ninoy. Then, “Tie A Yellow Ribbon” became one of our favorite unifying anthems. She was a Yellow Friday stalwart in Davao.

What about those who assisted nonlawyer-economist Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in extending the water deals to 2037? She may also be considered a Yellow (although she and Prez Cory eventually parted ways). I recall attending a gathering she sponsored in her La Vista home after Ninoy was salvaged. (But, her father, Diosdado had been quiet after the aborted effort on April 1, 1976 to secure asylum in the US Embassy with his wife. He had just written a book then critical of the regime, Democracy in the Philippines. Where he was thereafter, or between Aug. 21, 1983 and EDSA ‘86, I have not the foggiest notion.)

Foreign Affairs head Carlos P. Romulo (CPR) ridiculed the failed effort to seek asylum as an April Fool’s Day prank. However, I also recall that, ailing, after Ninoy was sent to the Promised Land, he spoke openly against the dictator in an item I read in Mr. & Ms. Special Edition (which could then print half a million copies and be sold out).

CPR would be a Yellow in that sense. He was a Macoy apologist for the longest time but in the end, when the end was near, he couldn’t take it anymore as Macoy, Imelda and Kokoy Romualdez were “stealing us blind,” he told United States State Assistant Secretary Richard Holbrooke, in poignant recantation. He appealed for American assistance: “You must help us regain our freedom.” He was saddened and shocked by the salvaging of Ninoy: “These people are ruining my country. They must be stopped.” He stressed: “The problem is Marcos,” (New York Times, Jan. 24, 1986).

US ‘interference’

We in the tiny insignificant human rights community in the late 1970s hailed Prez Jimmy Carter’s and Assistant Secretary Patt Derian’s blatant “interference,” as the rinky-dink administration of justice here then reflected the prevailing local power situation. There is always the Universal, not Parochial or Insular, Declaration of Human Rights to invoke.

If the administration would keep alienating critics, the time may come when SocDems, Natdems, Gad-Dems and Let-Dems may unite against it in a divided nation. It took the people more than a decade of merciless martial law. Hitler was supported by the “good Germans,” including lawyers. Ninoy said we could be likened to a carabao, patient, but angered and provoked sufficiently, watch out. Meantime, we continue to bear with the offensive Nazi salute headed by the Prez.

Not all critics are enemies. And the duty anyway of the opposition is to oppose, per Randolph Churchill, who refined George Tierney’s “oppose everything and propose nothing.” Not just point out that an egg is rotten but to try to lay a better one.

Let ideas compete then for acceptance in the marketplace, including ideas we may despise. Veep Leni Robredo’s findings and recommendations deserve a better reception. No bloody messy violence against drug trafficking has succeeded anywhere in the world. The Prez, in being unable to pick a new head of the Philippine National Police (PNP) and prohibiting it to deal with procurement, leads us in effect in cautioning that after one shakes the hand of a policeman, to count his fingers afterwards. This paper reported last Tuesday: “The same SWS (Social Weather Stations) survey also showed 76 percent of Filipino adults said there were multiple violations of rights in the conduct of the war on drugs.”

Real yellow peril

So, still all Injuns, no PNP chief, months after Director General Oscar Albayalde left even as we, a nation of 100 million rabbits, ended the decade as the world’s top rice importer, topping even China’s 1.3 billion, exporting here not rice, but certain undesirables. As Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam resist, we may for our part wake up one morning as the 24th province of China, which continues to reject our arbitral victory in 2016. Why oh why, kaya?

Sana, I can adjust my tight sked today to listen to Justice TonyCarp in his noon talk at the Philippine Chamber of Commerce (established in 1886) in Intramuros.

There is a real “yellow peril” and we cannot simply abide by advice of Confucious: if rape is inevitable, just lie back and enjoy it.

China has not accepted the 2016 arbitral ruling. Neither did the US when Nicaragua beat it in the International Court of Justice in 1986. The lawyer who won both cases: Paul Reichler, who attended Harvard Law, as I, blest by Providence, did, and trained in Arnold & Porter, as I also did. Both institutions sharpen concern for underdogs the bullies abuse or ignore.

Condolences to and prayers for the Macaraigs for the “homegoing” of Twink, daughter of Prez Cory’s Executive Secretary, Jun Macaraig, a certified Yellow. Also, the Syjucos, for the loss of Buboy, who I met in Baguio in one National Union of Students conference, and once helped, on his request, a significant other of his, of whom the Prez admits having (plural), not cronies.
