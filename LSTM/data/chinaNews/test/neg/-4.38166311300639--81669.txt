CANTON — Firefighters freed a worker from a piece of machinery at a Canton factory Friday morning, officials say.

The man was seriously injured after being caught in equipment at a distribution center for Destination XL, a big and tall men's clothing company. He was taken by helicopter to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.

"A person fell onto a conveyor belt and his chest got caught in that," Deputy Canton Fire Chief Scott Johnson said. "He’s stable but his injuries are serious."

Johnson said the call came into the station around 7 a.m. Friday. Firefighters were able to lift the equipment off the man, who suffered injuries to his chest, Johnson said.

Destination XL's headquarters and distribution center are located in Canton.

"Our associate was alert and sustained non-life threatening injuries,” Peter Stratton, DXL’s executive vice president, said. “We are currently focused on giving our support to our associate and his family. DXL will cooperate with (the Occupational Safety and Health Administration) and any investigation related to the accident. Associate safety is our top priority."
