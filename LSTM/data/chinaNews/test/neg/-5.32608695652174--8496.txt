The landmark 2015 deal between Tehran and world powers meant to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons has been teetering on the edge of collapse since the U.S. pulled unilaterally in 2018. The EU said Wednesday, Jan. 8, 2020, that it will spare no effort to keep the deal alive, but with tensions between the U.S. escalating into open hostilities it's seeming increasingly unlikely that will be possible.

The decision by European nations to trigger a dispute resolution mechanism in the Iran nuclear deal marks the latest step in the unraveling of the accord, which began when President Donald Trump walked away from the agreement and began restoring sanctions on Iran.

The agreement, reached under President Barack Obama, imposed restrictions and stepped-up monitoring of Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. Trump and other critics faulted the deal for not addressing Iran's ballistic missile program or its support for armed groups across the region.

Even after Trump's withdrawal, Iran complied with the deal until last summer, when it announced it would begin exceeding limits set by the agreement because it was no longer getting the economic benefits it was promised.

Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, the other signatories, remain committed to the deal. The European nations have tried but failed to develop a mechanism that would allow them to continue trading with Iran. The U.S. sanctions have devastated Iran’s economy.

On Tuesday, the Europeans said they would trigger the dispute mechanism to try to bring Iran back into compliance with the deal.

Meanwhile, the U.S. and Iran make a prisoner swap that frees Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian and three other Iranian-Americans. The U.S. makes a $400 million cash delivery to Iran the same day. Those funds were related to undelivered military equipment from the shah’s era.

May 8, 2019: Iran vows to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels if world powers fail to negotiate new terms for the nuclear deal.
