The University of Texas announced Wednesday it would suspend all undergraduate student trips to China in response to the outbreak of a respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus that is thought to have to have originated in that country.

UT also will move its students who are studying abroad in China to other programs or back to Austin, spokesman J.B. Bird said. He said fewer than 10 students are currently there, but university officials declined to name the cities where they are, citing security concerns.

In addition, a university committee that reviews travel to restricted regions will have to approve any requests from faculty, staff and graduate students who want to go to China. The country has joined Honduras, Nigeria and Pakistan on the list of areas that UT says pose a high risk.

"Our top priority is to support the health, safety and security of our community and remain vigilant during this evolving health crisis," the university said in a statement. "We are prepared to make adjustments to our approach as circumstances warrant and are hopeful that conditions will improve for our activities to resume in China."

UT student travel to the U.S. from China is not suspended. The university will follow U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protocols for people traveling from China, officials said.

Texas A&M University also has suspended all undergraduate travel to China and will review all graduate and employee travel on a case-by-case basis. A Texas A&M graduate student who had fallen ill after traveling from Wuhan, China, was tested last week for the coronavirus, and was found not to have it.

The University of Houston also restricted travel to China this week.

Meanwhile, countries began evacuating their citizens from Wuhan, the Chinese city hardest hit by the virus. Chartered planes carrying about 200 evacuees each arrived in Japan and the United States early Wednesday as other countries planned similar evacuations from Wuhan.

The 201 Americans evacuated from Wuhan are undergoing three days of monitoring at a southern California military base to make sure they do not show signs of the virus, the AP reported. None of the passengers showed signs of having the virus before their flight left.

As efforts to contain the new virus intensifies, British Airways has halted all flights to China, and American Airlines suspended Los Angeles flights to and from Shanghai and Beijing.

The U.S. has not declared any travel restrictions, though U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told the AP "itâ€™s important to not take anything off the table" when he was asked about that potential.
