The U.S. Attorney’s Office announced Tuesday cases against three individuals accused of concealing ties to the People’s Republic of China while conducting research in Massachusetts.

Charles Lieber, chairman of the department of chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard University, was arrested Tuesday on charges of making false statements. Authorities say he failed to disclose ties to a Chinese government-run program setup to entice scientists and researchers in the U.S. to share their expertise and research with China.

Lieber will appear Tuesday afternoon before judge Marianne B. Bowler in federal court in Boston. He is on paid administrative leave from Harvard and will not have access to the campus nor will be be able to continue in his teaching and research roles.

In a separate case, the Department of Justice said Yanqing Ye, a lieutenant in the People’s Liberation Army had gained a non-immigrant visa to conduct studies at Boston University. According to court documents, Ye was conducting research in the Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering at the Center of Polymer Studies at Boston University.

Authorities say on Ye’s visa application she misrepresented her foreign military service to gain entry to the U.S.

United States Attorney Andrew Lelling said in a press conference at the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse Tuesday that Ye was working as an unregistered agent of the People’s Republic of China and concealed her military connections while working as a researcher.

“A colonel in the People’s Republic of China gave Ye numerous assignments while she was in the United States, such as assessing U.S. military websites,” Lelling said. “She lied about her involvement with Chinese military projects.”

Court documents also allege Ye sent U.S. documents and information to China.

A third person, a 29-year-old Chinese national Zaosong Zheng, was charged with attempting to smuggle 21 vials of biological materials out of the country in a sock.

According to court documents, officers for Customs and Border Patrol stopped Zheng as he was boarding a flight to China from Boston Logan International Airport. Agents searched Zheng’s luggage and found the vials in plastic bags and placed in a sock. Authorities allege after initially denying that he had any biological materials, then saying that they were given to him by a friend. Zheng later confessed to having stolen the vials from Beth Israel Hospital, according to authorities.

“This is not an accident or coincidence,” Lelling said, of the three cases. “This is a small sample of China’s ongoing campaign” to siphon off U.S. technology and research.

Officials would not say if the three cases were connected other than involving attempts by China to conduct “a massive, long-term campaign to steal U.S. technology.”

In Lieber’s case, officials say the Harvard professor was paid more than a million over the years to share research with China.

Unlike the U.S., where private companies are not required to share research and information with the government, officials said in China sharing with Chinese entities does not carry the same relationship.

“That research and expertise is now at the disposal of the Chinese government,” Lelling said.

Ye is charged with visa fraud, making false statements and acting as an illegal agent of a foreign government and conspiracy. Lieber is charged with making a false, fictitious and fraudulent statement. Zheng is charged with smuggling goods from the United States and making false, fictitious or fraudulent statements.
