MANILA -- Offshore gaming firms in Pasay City should step up hygiene measures to prevent the spread of a new coronavirus strain from China, according to a mayor's order released to its operators.

Pasay south of Metro Manila is one of the hubs of Philippine Offshore Gaming Operations or POGOs that employ mainly Chinese nationals. The virus, which claimed 630 lives, mostly in China, was first detected in the mainland city of Wuhan.

Employees who deal with clients should wear masks. A 10-day quarantine on workers from affected countries should be imposed, Mayor Imelda Calixto-Rubiano said in the document dated Jan. 31.

POGOs should have clinics to monitor arriving staff from coronovirus-affected countries. Forehead thermometers should be used to detect fever while hand sanitizers should be placed in high-traffic areas, she said.

Proper hygiene and garbage disposal should be observed at all times, she said.

Authorities are monitoring offshore gaming hubs that employ mostly Chinese expatriates for signs of a new coronavirus strain, Interior Undersecretary Epimaco Densing III earlier said.

President Rodrigo Duterte ordered a ban on in-bound travel from China, Macau and Hong Kong to prevent the spread of the virus in the country. Flights between the two countries were also suspended.
