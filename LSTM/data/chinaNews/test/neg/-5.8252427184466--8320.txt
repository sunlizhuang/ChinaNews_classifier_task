HARBIN, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese customs have arrested seven suspects for smuggling 82 kg of gold worth about 25 million yuan (3.6 million U.S. dollars) since December last year, according to local authorities.

The customs in Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, received a tip-off in early December that a gang based in Qingdao, east China's Shandong Province, had been smuggling gold beyond the border from Harbin.

In a joint operation, customs in both cities launched two separate raids to capture the suspects, with 22 kg of gold seized.

The case is under further investigation.
