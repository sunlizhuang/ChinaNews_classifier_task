Hong Kong’s Health Secretary says the government is meeting on Monday to further discuss effective measures to prevent the spread of the Wuhan virus following its announcement of the denied entry of Hubei residents and anyone who visited the province in the past 14 days last Sunday.

However, the policy, which is in effect from January 27, is not applicable to Hong Kong residents. It comes as the number of confirmed cases in the city stood at eight as of Monday.

In an interview with local broadcaster RTHK, Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Siu-chee urged visitors to Hong Kong to give truthful declaration on the place they came from, or they shall receive a penalty.

Chan also said local citizens returning from Hubei province will also have their information recorded, and will be quarantined if necessary.

The ban on travellers coming from Hubei is just a preliminary step, she said.

“We have to consider the practicality of banning all mainland residents from entering and leaving Hong Kong, and whether we can launch such a procedure promptly,” she said.

She added that the government will not use Fai Ming Estate in Fanling to isolate patients infected with the new virus, after the move stirred up controversy and led to protesters building roadblocks and setting fire near the empty public housing estate to show their discontent.

Chan said instead, the government is only contemplating the idea of using the buildings as a plan B quarantine venue, to accommodate medical staff or close contacts of people infected with the virus but who do not show any symptoms.
