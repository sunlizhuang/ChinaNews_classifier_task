Six people in the UK are being tested for suspected coronavirus after travelling to the country from Wuhan, China.

Five people are being screened for the respiratory illness in Scotland and a sixth is being screened in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

Some 18 people have died of the virus and there has been more than 600 cases, including several outside of China.

It comes as the World Health Organisation’s emergency committee said it is “too early” to declare an international public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak.

China is battling to contain the deadly virus in its Hubei province as hundreds of millions of people prepare to travel over the Lunar New Year.

Wuhan and other parts of Hubei have lockdowns in place, including curbs on public transport.

All but one of the 18 deaths have been in Hubei.

Edinburgh-based Professor Jurgen Haas warned that there could be many more cases from other cities in the UK.

He added that tests are currently being carried out and none of the patients have been confirmed as having the disease.

They all travelled to Scotland from Wuhan, where the outbreak is thought to have originated, within the past two weeks and are showing symptoms of respiratory trouble, a red flag for the virus.

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation, said: “Make no mistake. This is an emergency in China. But it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one.”

The director-general added: “I wish to reiterate the fact that I am not declaring a PHEIC today should not be taken as a sign that WHO does not think the situation is serious, or that we are not taking it seriously.

“Nothing could be further from the truth. WHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day.”

Meanwhile Prof Haas said he believes there will be "many more cases" of coronavirus in the UK

"We have currently three cases suspected Wuhan coronavirus in Edinburgh and as far as I understand one case in Glasgow."

He said the cases emerged overnight, adding: "The situation will be pretty similar in pretty much all UK cities with a large number of Chinese students.

"It's not too surprising. My suspicious is that there will probably be many more cases in many other cities in the UK.

"None of the cases I know of have been confirmed."

He said there is only one laboratory testing for the virus, operated by Public Health England (PHE).

The professor said the cases have been flagged up through the PHE infection guidelines as they travelled to Wuhan within the last 14 days and are showing signs of respiratory symptoms.

It was originally reported that there were four suspected cases in Scotland, however, the Scottish government stated that there were only three people receiving screening for the coronavirus.

However, they then put out a fresh press statement raising the number to five.

A patient is being tested to rule out coronavirus at Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital, it is understood.

The patient arrived at the hospital showing symptoms which may be associated with the condition but it will be some time before test results are returned.

The Belfast Health Trust which runs services was unable to make any comment.

The international outbreak has so far killed 18 people and infected more than 600.

The Chinese Government has effectively locked down Wuhan, cancelling planes and trains there and in the nearby city of Huanggang.
