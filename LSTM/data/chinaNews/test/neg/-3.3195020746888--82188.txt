Pete Brierton was with Wisconsin 1’s Disaster Medical Assistance Team when a group of evacuees landed at Miramar Marine Corps Air Station in San Diego.

It was Brierton’s job to monitor the patients during their two week quarantine, WISN-TV reports.

“All the evacuees wore face masks all the time, even when they were inside their own housing they were wearing those,” Brierton told the station. “If we had any interaction with the patients, we were in full protective equipment. We had gowns, face masks, face shields, wore gloves anytime we had patient interaction.”

Brierton said he had no concerns as part of the team that did treat the patients.

“The CDC has put us on a 14-day watch list, meaning that I get daily reminders from the CDC, saying if I have any symptoms to contact them,” he said. “We take our own temperatures and do self-reporting twice a day. I have no expectation that I’ll have a fever.”
