Riyadh – Abdulhadi Habtor

Saudi Arabia announced on Thursday the signing of six contracts with global companies to provide medical equipment and supplies to China in its effort to combat the new coronavirus outbreak.

The deals were signed by the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSRelief) and coordinated with the Chinese Embassy in the Kingdom.

KSRelief Supervisor General Dr. Abdullah Al-Rabeeah said the first shipment of emergency aid will arrive in China in five days.

The aid includes 1,159 medical devices, 300,000 N95 protective masks and 1,000 protective suits.

The remaining shipments are expected to reach China within no more than two weeks, said Al-Rabeeah.

Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdulaziz was clear in ordering that the aid be urgently delivered to China, he stressed.

KSRelief will work tirelessly to meet his demand, he vowed.

Moreover, he said the aid underscores the solid relations between Saudi Arabia and China.

This noble gesture reflects the pioneering humanitarian role Saudi Arabia plays in the world, Al-Rabeeah added.

Chinese Ambassador to the Kingdom Chen Weiqing hailed Saudi Arabia’s aid pledge, saying it reflects the Riyadh government’s noble intentions towards the Chinese people.

He expressed Beijing’s gratitude to King Salman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Saudi government and people for their support.
