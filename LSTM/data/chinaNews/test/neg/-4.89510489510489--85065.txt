A joint operation in Dublin has led to the seizure of eleven kilos of herbal cannabis.

Gardai and Revenue officers have dealt a blow to the organised drug trade in the North of the city.

As part of an intelligence led operation, raids were carried out on two houses in Cabra and FInglas that uncovered eleven kilograms of cannabis.

The illegal drugs were concealed in two packages described as ‘clothing’, and have an estimated value of €220,000.

The joint operation was conducted by Revenue’s Customs Service, the Garda Drugs & Organised Crime Bureau, the K Community Action Team and Gardaí from Store Street Drugs Unit.

A 40 year old Irish man and a 37 year old Chinese man were arrested and detained under section 2 of The Criminal Justice Act 1996 at Store Street and Cabra Garda stations.

Investigations are ongoing.
