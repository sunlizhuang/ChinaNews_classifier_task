The University of Tennessee-Knoxville is suspending all study-abroad programs in China this semester because of the threat of coronavirus, the university told Knox News.

UT has received no reports of coronavirus infection from people associated with the university, but it is cancelling the trips "as a precaution," UT-Knoxville spokesman Owen Driskill said.

There were 21 students planning to study in China this semester, and one student was already in China. That student was not near Wuhan, where the outbreak of coronavirus originated, but will return to the United States, Driskill said.

"The UT Center for Global Engagement is in contact with all affected students and will work with them to make other arrangements to complete their academic work," Driskill said.

There are currently no UT faculty or staff members in China. No decision has been made on whether students planning to travel to China on a mini-term in May or during the summer semester will still be able to go, Driskill said. UT is continuing to monitor developments with coronavirus, he said.

What is coronavirus?

The center of the coronavirus outbreak is Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in the central China province of Hubei. The city, and several others, are on a tight lockdown as China attempts to contain the virus.

There have been nearly 6,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in China as of Wednesday, and five confirmed cases in the United States. One Tennessee Tech student underwent screening for coronavirus, but tested negative.

Common symptoms of coronavirus infection include fever, cough, difficulty breathing and shortness of breath, according to the federal Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms can appear within two days, the CDC said.

The virus can be transmitted from animals to people and between people. On Thursday, the first case of person-to-person transmitted coronavirus was confirmed. It's not clear what animal the 2019 strain of coronavirus came from, but it's native to China.

Early cases of the coronavirus were linked to a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, according to the CDC.

The CDC has recommended that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to China because of the virus. American Airlines and United have adjusted and canceled some flights to China.

Events at MTSU canceled

Earlier this week, Middle Tennessee State University canceled several events featuring groups from China because of coronavirus concerns.

MTSU canceled a Tuesday concert featuring the Jinling Dragon ensemble in celebration of Chinese New Year. A Feb. 8 concert featuring the Zhou Family Band was also canceled.

No events at UT have been canceled at this point, Driskill said.

Flu in Tennessee

While there have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Tennessee so far, flu has remained a concern. Several school districts, including Knox, Sevier and Anderson county schools, closed for the remainder of the week because of increased absences.

Knox County Schools will reopen on Monday.

UT, meanwhile, "has not experienced unusual class cancellations or absences due to flu but will continue to monitor," Driskill said.
