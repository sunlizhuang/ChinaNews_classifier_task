Despite aggressively monitoring for new cases, Dr. Nancy Messonnier from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the number of confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the United States remains at five, as of Wednesday.

Messonnier said that there have been 165 suspected cases of coronavirus, but of those 68 have come back negative. Ninety-two cases are unconfirmed.

This comes as 195 Americans staying in Wuhan have returned to the United States on Wednesday. Messonnier said all 195 are all voluntarily staying in isolation for 72 hours.

Messonnier said none of the 195 Americans have presented any symptoms.

Messonnier added that at this time, the risk of the coronavirus to the general population is low.

The CDC is conducting screening at 20 airports, and is working to inform passengers returning to the United States from China on the signs of the coronavirus.
