Public transport into Huanggang will be stopped from midnight on Thursday and the city’s seven million residents ordered not to leave as officials across the country scramble to contain the deadly virus. Public gatherings are also being discouraged and venues across the major city will be shut. Huanggang is 47 miles from Wuhan, the city where coronavirus was first detected and which has also been put on lockdown.

International news agency BNO News said: “Officials say Huanggang, which is next to Wuhan and has a population of 7 million, will shut down its transportation system at midnight and citizens should not leave the city. All public venues are closed.” Earlier on Thursday, the country’s transport ministry suspended all shuttle buses and ferries going to Wuhan. The ministry also asked buses passing through Wuhan to adjust their routes immediately to bypass the city, adding that passengers must not be allowed to get off there. Buses and ferries already on their way to Wuhan were told by the Ministry of Transport to return to their starting points immediately as part of the crackdown.
