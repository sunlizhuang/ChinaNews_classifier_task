The refrain seems to impose itself in the French debate: Trump would only be the continuation of Obama in foreign policy, both being the product of an America tired of "endless wars," disappointed by ungrateful allies, aspiring to refocus on itself to face its only same size adversary: China. In this perspective, Trump would represent the new American normality, an evolution that France would have understood before the others, an evolution that appears to be accommodated with.

The analysis reveals French priorities, but it remains reductive. Even more worrying, it could become a deterministic model if it makes Trumpism the only horizon of the current uncertain American policy. Moreover, this vision is far from being shared by all Franceâ€™s European partners, which results in the inability to build a sovereign Europe.
