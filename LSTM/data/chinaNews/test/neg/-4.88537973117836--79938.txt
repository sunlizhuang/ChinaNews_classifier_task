The 91 evacuees were quarantined for 14 days at a hotel on base. During the quarantine, one was found to have the virus and was taken to Methodist Hospital | Texsan on the Northwest Side.

The quarantine has been lifted for 90 coronavirus evacuees who were brought to Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland earlier this month from Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday.

Kate Grusich, a CDC spokeswoman, said in statement that the evacuees were medically cleared and are now allowed to travel home.

“It is important to know that these people being released from quarantine pose no health risk to the surrounding community, or to the communities they will be returning to,” the statement said. “CDC extends its thanks to these individuals for their cooperation and patience during their quarantine and wish them well as they return to home, work, and school.”

The one person from that group who tested positive for the virus last week will remain in San Antonio, the statement said. They will continue to undergo treatment at Methodist Hospital | Texsan.

The 91 people arrived at Lackland on Feb. 7, via a State Department-chartered flight out of the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in China. Upon their arrival in San Antonio, they were issued a legally binding quarantine order that kept them there for the next 14 days, which is believed to be the virus’ incubation period.

A second group of 144 people who had been exposed to the coronavirus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship were brought to Lackland on Monday.

While the CDC has not released information on that group, the Texas Department of State Health Services has said that it is treating some number of patients who have been infected or are displaying symptoms at the Texas Center for Infectious Disease, a state-run hospital on the South Side.
