China has established a working mechanism for joint prevention and control with multiple departments involved, and taken resolute and effective measures in Wuhan in central China’s Hubei Province, as well as other regions of the country, to contain the spread of the epidemic with all its strength, Yang said.

He noted that China has the confidence and capability to win the battle of epidemic prevention and control.

Since the outbreak of the epidemic, China, in an open, transparent and responsible manner, has promptly informed the World Health Organization (WHO) and relevant countries and regions, including the United States, of the epidemic situation.

In addition to sharing information such as the genetic sequence of the new virus at the first time, China has invited experts from the WHO and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions to do field study in Wuhan, Yang said.

China attaches great importance to the safety of all foreigners in China, including U.S. nationals, Yang said, adding that China stands ready to continue to maintain close coordination and cooperation with the United States.
