Amazon is the latest technology company to completely pull out of attending this month's Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona because of the coronavirus outbreak.

MWC normally attracts more than 100,000 visitors to Barcelona with up to 6,000 of them arriving from China, where the outbreak began and has killed 908 people to date.

In a statement on Sunday, Amazon said: "Due to the outbreak and continued concerns about the new coronavirus, Amazon will withdraw from exhibiting and participating in Mobile World Congress 2020."

GSMA, the global telecoms industry association behind MWC, confirmed in a statement that "some large exhibitors have decided not to come to the show this year with others still contemplating next steps".

"We are grateful for the preventative measures our Chinese exhibitors have put in place, notably ZTE and Huawei," GSMA added.

GSMA stated in addition to the Spanish authorities' measures it was banning all travellers from the Hubei province from entering the event, while any visitors who have been in China will need to demonstrate proof that they have been outside of China for a fortnight prior to the event.

Attendees will also be temperature screened and will need to self-certify that they have not been in contact with anyone infected with coronavirus.

In the UK the spread of coronavirus has been described as a "serious and imminent threat" to the public.

The announcement gives the government additional powers to fight the spread of the virus, which originated in a market in Wuhan, China and has been confirmed in eight people in the UK.

A Department of Health statement said: "The Secretary of State has made regulations to ensure that the public are protected as far as possible from the transmission of the virus.
