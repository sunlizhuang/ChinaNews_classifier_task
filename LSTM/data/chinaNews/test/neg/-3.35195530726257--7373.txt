Everything you need to know about the significance of the heat record set last year

What is the significance of record ocean heat in 2019?

The new record represents the most stark demonstration that global heating is unequivocally real and driving the climate crisis. With emissions still rising every year, more heat is being trapped by greenhouse gases, and the ocean data is crystal clear: an unrelenting and accelerating rise for at least the past half century. Lijing Cheng, at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: “There are no reasonable alternatives aside from the human emissions of heat-trapping gases to explain this.”

Aren’t surface air temperatures more important?

We live on the surface of the Earth, and so air temperature is the most common heat measurement. But two-thirds of the planet’s area is ocean and water can absorb far more heat than air. As a result, just 4% of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases warms the air and land.

So to really see what is happening with global heating, you need to look at the oceans. Here, the signal is unmistakable, with every year in the past decade recording hotter oceans that the year before, bar one. In contrast, air temperature is more affected by the natural variation that overlies human-caused global heating. The hottest year for air temperature to date is 2016, thanks to an El Niño event, though 2019 may slot in at number two when the final data is available.

We live on land, so why worry about the oceans?

The oceans and atmosphere are inextricably linked. Changing ocean heat means changing rains, and that means more floods in some places and more droughts and wildfires in others. Furthermore, hotter oceans mean more sea level rise, threatening cities from Shanghai to Miami and Rio de Janeiro to Alexandria.

Hotter oceans also supercharge storms, with Kevin Trenberth at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research noting that a hotspot in the Gulf of Mexico in 2017 spawned Hurricane Harvey. That led to 82 deaths and caused about $108bn in damage. In 2018, a hotspot in the Atlantic Ocean near the Carolinas led to Hurricane Florence.

What about marine life?

Many coral reefs are already suffering from bleaching. But the increasing number of ocean heatwaves are affecting all life. For example, the hot “blob” seen in the North Pacific from 2013 to 2015 caused a major loss of marine life, from plankton and fish – including 100 million cod – to marine mammals such as whales.

Is the record ocean heat a tipping point?

No, but it might lead to some. Climate tipping points are reached when particular impacts of global heating become unstoppable, such as the runaway loss of ice sheets or forests, or the release of the potent greenhouse gas methane from melting tundra. Some scientists think the world may already have crossed a series of tipping points. If so, the buildup of heat graphically demonstrated in the oceans shows why.

Can anything be done?

Yes. The way to end global heating and tackle the climate emergency is to stop emitting greenhouse gases. Most importantly that means a rapid end to fossil fuel burning, plus the protection and regeneration of forests and cutting down emissions from farming, in particular from cattle. There is no time to lose.
