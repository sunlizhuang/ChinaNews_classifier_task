A Harvard University professor has been charged with lying to US officials about his involvement with a Chinese government-run recruitment program and his affiliation with a Chinese university.

Charles Lieber, chair of the department of chemistry and chemical biology, was arrested at his office at the prestigious university on Tuesday morning and charged with one count of 'making materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statements to an agency of the US government,' according to an affidavit.

Prosecutors say Lieber lied to the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health about his participation in China's Thousand Talents Plan.

The program was established by the Chinese government in 2008 to recruit people with access to and knowledge of foreign technology and intellectual property.

The US government has designated the program a danger to national security.

Under his Thousand Talents Plan contract, Lieber allegedly received around $1.74million for research he conducted for China's Wuhan University of Technology, along with an additional $50,000 in monthly salary and $158,000 in living expenses.

Lieber is due to appear in court on Tuesday afternoon. His attorney has not returned requests for comment.

Harvard spokesman Jonathan L Swain confirmed that Lieber had been placed on 'indefinite' paid leave.

'The charges brought by the US government against Professor Lieber are extremely serious,' Swain wrote in a statement emailed to the Harvard Crimson student newspaper.

'Harvard is cooperating with federal authorities, including the National Institutes of Health, and is conducting its own review of the alleged misconduct.'

Swain added that Lieber will not be allowed on Harvard's campus and will not continue his teaching and research roles.

Harvard was reportedly unaware that Lieber became a so-called 'Strategic Scientist' at Wuhan University of Technology in 2011, and that he had a contract to participate in the Thousand Talents Plan.

Prosecutors said that he has led the Lieber Research Group at Harvard since 2008.

The group specializes in nanoscience and has collected more than $15million in grant funding from the National Institutes of Health and Department of Defense.

Grant recipients are required to disclose any significant foreign financial conflicts of interest, including funding from foreign governments, US Attorney Andrew E Lelling's office.

The case reflects ongoing Justice Department concerns that universities are failing to report foreign sources of funding that their professors receive, particularly from China.

'Today's case involving the Harvard professor offers much needed awareness to China's Thousand Talents Program and its extension to recruiting non-Chinese nationals,' Frank Figliuzzi, a former assistant director for counterintelligence at the FBI, told NBC News after the charges were announced.

Federal prosecutors across the country in the last year have charged multiple scientists working in the United States with hiding research grants from Beijing and with pilfering research so that it can it be used for China's economic gain.

Officials have sounded the alarm in particular about talent recruitment programs that they say are thinly veiled efforts to seize on American research.

Authorities also announced charges against a Chinese national who is accused of working with the Chinese army while she was a student at Boston University.

Prosecutors say Yanqing Ye, an alleged lieutenant in the People's Liberation Army, conducted research for China's National University of Defense Technology while she attended BU from October 2017 to April 2019.

Ye is also charged with granting a Chinese military researcher access to her BU virtual private network (VPN) login so the researcher could conduct web searches from China without detection.
