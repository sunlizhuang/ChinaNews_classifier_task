As families across China gather around dinner tables this weekend, young single men and women will be facing an interrogation about marriage. If you’re single in China, the inquest into why begins now – at New Year Eve dinner, the once-a-year occasion where families do not pull any punches.

Cuihun or “harass to marry”, is a phenomenon most acute at this time of the year, describing the torture that single people often go through at the dinner table.

If you're female, single and aged over 27, you will labelled a "leftover woman" - a term once specifically used to refer to urban unmarried women, who are considered 'pickier' because of their education and status. You'll face a barrage of questions from relatives, and attempts to marry you off. Many employers are even offering "dating leave" around the Chinese New Year to help get these poor unfortunate souls off the shelf.

That's bad enough. But there's another group of people for whom Chinese New Year is something to be endured: the LGBTQ community. Welcome to their most torturous day of the year.

Lies, fake partners and sham marriages are all ways that the LGBTQ community get through the holiday, in a country where over 95 per cent of this population hides their sexuality from family members.

'Some exposure is better than none'

But the issue has gained traction in recent weeks, thanks to an advert from China’s biggest e-commerce platform Tmall, a subsidiary of Alibaba, showing a young man taking his boyfriend home for New Year dinner.

In the short advert (used to sell nuts), two young women snigger as the couple arrive and the father peers cautiously around the kitchen door. He is caught by surprise when his son's boyfriend calls him “Dad” during dinner, in a way that is traditionally expected from sons-in-law.

The lighthearted scenario is far from reality, given that homosexuality is still frowned upon by families, and most same-sex content is banned, often under the "abnormal sexual behaviour" banner.
