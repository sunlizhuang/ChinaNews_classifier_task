PHNOM PENH: Chinese nationals remain the top perpetrators and victims of crimes in Cambodia, according to a report from the national police, which documented 324 criminal cases involving Chinese nationals, a rise of 15.12 per cent compared to 275 cases in 2018.

More than 1,000 Chinese nationals were arrested in connection with online gambling, prostitution, drugs and other crimes. They were deported in October.

The Khmer Times said the majority of the crimes were committed in the provinces of Preah Sihanouk, Siem Reap and Phnom Penh.

There were 558 criminal cases involving 681 foreign victims, an increase of 5.5 per cent compared with figures in 2018.

Deputy chief of the National Police General Thong Lim said even though police worked closely with embassies, there were complaints about a lack of communication.

“I acknowledge that some of our officers did not fully enforce the law and carry out their work efficiently, preventing the rescue of victims on time. We accepted all requests for firm action against perpetrators.”

He ordered the police to continue investigating criminal cases involving foreign nationals and hold regular meetings with embassy representatives to share information and provide solutions.

“We must listen to concerns brought by foreign investors and ensure security for them.”

President of the People Centre for Development and Peace Yong Kim Eng said ministries must collaborate with embassies to prevent crimes by foreigners.

“I have noticed many foreigners, particularly from China, committing outrageous offences,” Kim Eng said.

“They should be monitored to ensure national security. The increase of foreign victims and crimes committed by foreigners will affect investments and tourism in Cambodia. I hope the authorities will take serious action on this.”
