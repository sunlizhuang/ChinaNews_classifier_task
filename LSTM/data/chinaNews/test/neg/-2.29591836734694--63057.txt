Vietnamese border guard officers have been exerting their best efforts to monitor all people arriving from China to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the Southeast Asian country.

Officers have worked around the clock to measure body temperature and quarantine Vietnamese citizens returning from China via border gates in the northern provinces of Lang Son and Lao Cai.

As a lot of Vietnamese people still need to come home via these border gates, multiple teams of border guard and disease control officers have been taking turns working in continuous shifts to prevent the contagion of the 2019-nCoV.

A Vietnam-China train also resumed its operation on Saturday following a five-day shutdown, which made the job even more demanding.

The novel coronavirus, which first surfaced in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, has killed 813 people and infected more than 37,550 globally as of Sunday.

It has since spread across mainland China and to 27 other countries and regions, according to a Reuters report.
