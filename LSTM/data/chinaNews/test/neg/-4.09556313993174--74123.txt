After cancelling its attendance at the Mobile World Congress, it seems Chipzilla is still rather scared of getting its ample bulk into an aircraft.

Intel has cancelled its channel event in Milan because of the coronavirus. While there has been a case of Kung Flu in Italy, it seems that Intel is taking no chances.

In an email sent to partners, Intel channel VP Greg Baur said the vendor had made the “difficult decision” to scrap the three-day event because a number of partners would have been unable to attend.

Baur said: “There are few things I look forward to more than bringing our partners together, and we were heading into a record event in terms of attendees, sponsors and partner diversity, so this was a tough decision.

“Unfortunately, too many of our partners are unable to travel due to restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, and this wouldn’t be the event we envisioned without them.

“We will be evaluating options for alternatives and will keep you posted as details emerge. Please cancel your travel plans immediately.”

Intel added that it would be in touch contact partners as soon as it has established “alternative plans”.

The event was scheduled to take place between 3-5 March at Milan Convention Centre.

Intel is due to hold a second Partner Connect event in Shanghai at the end of the month, followed by a third in Texas in May, according to its website.

“Unfortunately, too many of our partners are unable to travel due to restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, and this wouldn’t be the event we envisioned without them. Our Americas Intel Partner Connect event is currently scheduled to take place as planned.”
