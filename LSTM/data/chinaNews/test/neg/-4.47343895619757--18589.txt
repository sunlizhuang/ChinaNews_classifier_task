The US's shift to "great power competition" has mainly focused on the military aspects of the rivalry with Russia and China.

But those countries are expanding their influence in large part through corruption, which the US should target in order to counter them.

The Trump administration is due to soon formally release its findings from a review of US foreign assistance programs, aimed at "realigning" them for "a new era of great-power competition," which critics have described as an effort to curb foreign aid overall.

Given this context, aid and development organizations must be prepared to show how their work serves America's strategic interests. Anti-corruption efforts do just that by striking at the heart of what keeps leaders of adversaries like China and Russia in power.

Both countries are increasingly weaponizing corruption by using flows of illicit money and opaque deals to gain influence in foreign nations, from the Solomon Islands to Montenegro. Efforts to export these kleptocratic practices are key elements of Chinese and Russian foreign policy. They imperil American interests by compromising the independence of affected states and corroding their democratic governance.

As the United States seeks to recalibrate its foreign assistance spending to compete with Beijing and Moscow, it should augment efforts to tackle corruption.

Political systems plagued by graft are more susceptible to foreign malign influence because they incentivize leaders to accumulate power and wealth rather than advance broader national interests. Newer democracies and authoritarian governments are particularly vulnerable because their institutions are weak or have been captured by elites. In such contexts, civil society organizations, if they are allowed to exist at all, often lack the tools, access or resources to hold leaders accountable by uncovering and publicizing corruption.

Even when this information gets out, feeble or nonexistent checks and balances allow autocrats to govern unencumbered by the rule of law or any other form of public accountability.

In far-flung states like the Maldives and Ecuador, Chinese government-backed investments advance Beijing's strategic interests while creating unsustainable debt burdens, fueling local corruption and weakening governance. China's sweeping infrastructure investment scheme, known as the Belt and Road Initiative, is only one of the tools it uses to corrode democracy while creating more favorable conditions for realizing its objectives.

In Russia, too, kleptocracy is central to President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy, which is conducted through oligarchs and their local affiliates. These agents influence the decision-making process in foreign countries by bribing politicians and buying off government officials through opaque tendering processes and inflated contracts.

In some cases, organized criminal networks with links to senior Russian officials have been accused of money-laundering and other illicit activities. The objective of using such tactics abroad is the same as it is at home: co-opt elites and make them loyal.

These efforts allow China and Russia to expand their influence at the expense of the United States, meaning corruption should be seen not merely as a domestic political problem for foreign countries, but a threat to American interests.

In recognition of this problem, Washington has already deployed financial sanctions to punish corrupt individuals. But the US can also push back against Russian and Chinese influence by using targeted foreign aid to support the growth of institutions that can withstand and root out kleptocratic practices. The ongoing foreign assistance review offers an opportunity to leverage evidence-based approaches to help address other countries' governance vulnerabilities.

Three approaches stand out, all of which align with the Trump administration's efforts to ensure that US foreign assistance is oriented toward its great-power competition with China and Russia, while promoting good governance and transparency.

First and foremost, the US can broaden efforts to constrain elite behavior by bolstering independent media. Journalists play a key role in exposing corruption, which is a critical first step toward combating the role of foreign actors in kleptocratic networks. While the US government already devotes significant resources to media training around the world, the scale of the corruption challenge justifies additional investment in creating the next generation of independent journalists.

The U.S. should also use diplomatic engagement to push reforms to media ownership laws that promote openness and impartial coverage. In too many countries, autocratic governments are able to use cronies or proxies to control major news outlets and manipulate the flow of information. Transparent and independent media ownership is a necessary condition for much-needed investigations to reach a broader audience.

Without robust law enforcement and independent judiciaries, corruption exposed will remain corruption unpunished. US-funded technical assistance can strengthen domestic legal and judicial institutions that are critical to holding corrupt elites accountable.

The United States was the top donor to Guatemala's United Nations-backed anti-corruption commission, known as CICIG, which successfully brought charges against many senior officials in that country, including former President Otto Perez Molina, who resigned in 2015 under a cloud of scandal. The commission was expelled from Guatemala last year after facing opposition from then-President Jimmy Morales, whom it was investigating, but Honduras and El Salvador have both adopted a similar model, which could be replicated beyond Central America. Tepid support for CICIG from Washington in recent years hindered the commission's impact, so to succeed, future anti-corruption commissions will need to firmly secure US confidence and backing.

The United States can also scale up and further integrate technology into its anti-corruption interventions. Publishing government data online makes it harder for officials to hide information and enables citizens to press representatives for fairer deals with foreign partners.

For example, in North Macedonia, the US Agency for International Development and the International Republican Institute support an open finance portal that enables citizens and civil society organizations to monitor state budget transactions. This is a significant innovation for a region that Russia has traditionally seen as its backyard and where China has been making inroads, making it particularly vulnerable to malign influence.

Great-power competition is not only playing out in fights over tariff barriers, cyberspace or sea lanes in the Asia-Pacific. China and Russia are moving this struggle into the domestic politics of countries they perceive as vulnerable, exploiting corrupt political systems to their own ends.

As the United States implements the findings of its foreign assistance review, it should make sure that anti-corruption efforts are a prominent element of strategies to thwart Beijing's and Moscow's illiberal incursions.
