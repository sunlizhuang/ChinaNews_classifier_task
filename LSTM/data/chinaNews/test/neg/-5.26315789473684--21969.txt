DUBLIN Airport has been advised to trigger infection control precautions in the event of a passenger travelling from China showing potential symptoms of the new coronavirus.

The HSE said although there are no direct flights to Dublin from Wuhan in China, and returning passengers will not be actively quizzed, a safety protocol should be implemented if a suspected case presents to reduce the risk of spread.

Safeguards were stepped up in hospitals and GP surgeries yesterday as guidelines were issued by the national disease watchdog.

It emerged that a Chinese patient in Northern Ireland remained in isolation last night while the results of tests are awaited to find out if he has the killer coronavirus.

The suspected case came as five other patients were being tested for the virus in Scotland, heightening fears that it has already spread to Europe.

Dr Sam McConkey, a Dublin specialist in infectious diseases, said his fear would be the new virus would mutate and it would affect organs such as the liver and the bowels.

"It is early days but people are getting mobilised here," he said.

Health officials said the risk of a case in Ireland was low. The World Health Organisation's Emergency Committee said it was too early to declare a global emergency, but this must be kept under review. A number of suspected cases have been examined in hospitals in the Republic in the past week and none had to be formally tested.
