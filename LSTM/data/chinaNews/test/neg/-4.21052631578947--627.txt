Pakistan is capable to respond to any Indian aggression but the region cannot afford any type of war:

China has supported the narrative of Pakistan to resolve Kashmir issue in accordance with the UN Resolutions. The minorities in India have expressed solidarity with Muslims as Indian government has passed a discriminatory citizenship bill specifically targeting Muslims. Indian government is facing pressure from within India as well. India may stage a false flag operation just to divert the world's attention from the failure of its policies. Pakistan is capable to respond to any Indian aggression at any time but the region cannot afford any type of war at this period of time.
