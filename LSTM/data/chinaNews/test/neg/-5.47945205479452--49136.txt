A new hospital built in Wuhan in response to the coronavirus crisis opened its doors Monday.

The hospital, which was constructed in just 10 days and holds 1,000 beds, will attempt to make a dent in the growing number of confirmed cases of the virus in China, especially in Wuhan and the Hubei province. A second hospital with 1,500 beds is also scheduled to open within days, The Associated Press reported.

Chinese epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan said these new hospitals will help prevent further spread of the virus, as sick people have until this point remained at home, which “is extremely dangerous,” he told state broadcaster CCTV, according to the AP.

Before these hospitals were designed, the city had 6,754 patients in hospitals for the novel coronavirus. The translation of the name of the hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, means God of Fire Mountain, according to the AP.

The country has also designated various hospitals across the state for fighting the virus, including the Xiaotangshan Hospital in Beijing,, originally built for the SARS epidemic in the early 2000s.

The majority of cases of the novel coronavirus are confirmed in China, where it all started. The total number of cases around the world has reached 17,000. The virus has spread to more than 20 countries, with 11 cases in the U.S. and one death in the Philippines.

China has accused the U.S. of spreading fear surrounding the coronavirus instead of offering assistance after the U.S. became the first nation to partially remove its employees and put a ban in place preventing foreigners who visited China from travel to the U.S.

The World Health Organization declared the virus to be a global emergency last week.
