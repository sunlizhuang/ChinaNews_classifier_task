"We want to go back to Australia but there are two main issues: the lockdown, and all the roads to the airport are blocked.

"I'm also really worried about the spread of the virus on the plane. My child is too young to wear a mask. I'm not going to risk her getting infected."

Three evacuees from a Japanese government-chartered flight out of Wuhan last week were found to have the virus.

Roads blocked, vehicles banned

The man said his family went to stay with his wife's parents in the small village of Yichang for Chinese New Year. The village has around 30 homes and is about 400 kilometres from Wuhan.

Roads have been blocked and private vehicles banned. There is no public transport in many parts of the province. Mike is an Australian permanent resident but does not hold a passport. His daughter is an Australian passport holder.

He said while they had enough food they were running out of nappies.

â€œI have very little knowledge of Christmas Island but i know it is isolated. It is safer for me to stay in the village at the moment. My plan is to stay where I am until the epidemic is under control. "

However, he was worried about his job in Melbourne as he would have no income while trapped in China and still had to pay rent on his property in Australia.

Melbourne photographer Moko Yong, who set up a social media group with around 100 Australians in Wuhan, said many were concerned about being able to get to the airport. Australia does not have a consular presence in Wuhan.

About 150 Australians are understood to have registered for seats, reflecting what Prime Minister Scott Morrison called "very strong interest" from citizens and permanent residents there. Foreign Minister Marise Payne said at the weekend she expected the flight to be organised soon.

The United States, South Korea, Germany, Indonesia, United Kingdom and Turkey have had evacuation flights from Wuhan approved.

Another Wuhan resident who is in Sydney visiting her daughter said she went to Australia two weeks ago. Another passenger on her flight was diagnosed with the virus and she has been in self-quarantine at her daughter's house with her husband since.

"We had no other option. We had no symptoms. It is very sad this has developed so quickly and is affecting so many lives," the 65-year-old said.
