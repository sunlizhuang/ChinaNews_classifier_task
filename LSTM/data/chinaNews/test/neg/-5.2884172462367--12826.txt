SINGAPORE â€” The Ministry of Health (MOH) has been notified as of Friday afternoon (17 January) of two more suspect cases with pneumonia, who had travel history to the Chinese city of Wuhan where a mysterious virus has afflicted dozens and left two people dead.

Both cases in Singapore, involving a 64-year-old male Chinese national and a 61-year-old female Singapore resident, have been admitted for further assessment and treatment, and isolated as a precautionary measure, the MOH said.

The two cases did not visit the Huanan seafood wholesale market associated with the pneumonia cluster in Wuhan. They are in stable condition, and investigations are ongoing.

MOH also gave an update on the 69-year-old Singaporean man with pneumonia who had travelled to Wuhan. The case is not linked to the pneumonia cluster in Wuhan and has also tested negative for coronavirus.

A 69-year-old man died from the coronavirus in China on Wednesday, following the death of a 61-year-old man linked to the outbreak last Saturday.

A total 41 people in Wuhan have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, a family of viruses that can cause severe diseases like SARS and MERS.

Twelve patients have been cured and discharged while five were being treated for acute conditions in the Chinese city as of late Thursday.

One person in Japan and two people in Thailand have been diagnosed with the virus.
