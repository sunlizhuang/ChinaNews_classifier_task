New Hampshire health officials are waiting for test results to determine whether two people in the state have a coronavirus that has been linked to more than 100 deaths.>> Download the FREE WMUR appOfficials said the two recently traveled to Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak. They reported mild symptoms that could be caused by the virus, and they have been placed in isolation while tests are done.The World Health Organization has increased the risk level of the virus to high, with confirmed cases in nearly two dozen places around the world. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that 20 U.S. airports, including Boston Logan International Airport, will screen passengers for the illness.In New Hampshire, one of the patients in isolation is a 19-year-old man who returned from Wuhan on Jan. 6. Doctors at Littleton Regional Healthcare said he's doing well, and if not for his recent travel, he would have been treated and released."As of this moment, this case is still a suspected case," said Robert Nutter, president and CEO of Littleton Regional Healthcare.The patient is an international student at White Mountain School in Bethlehem. School officials said he was in the Hubei Province of China from Dec. 21 to Jan. 5. Officials said he was home during winter break but is not from Wuhan City.Hospital officials said the man came down with mild respiratory issues after returning to New Hampshire and immediately called for help. He was admitted to the hospital Thursday as a precaution."We were concerned about him because of his travel history, and his symptoms kind of pointed to a suspected case of this novel coronavirus," Nutter said.Those symptoms, including a fever, were mild."He had what would be considered by the general public almost a bad cold," said Dr. Ed Duffy, chief medical officer at Littleton Regional Healthcare.School officials said no one else on campus has reported any symptoms associated with coronavirusThe patient has been placed in a negative pressure room, Duffy said."A negative pressure room is a room that when the door opens, air rushes in. It does not go out," Duffy said. "So any respiratory droplets or the air in the room does not mix with the general air."Hospital officials said members of the staff who deal with the patient are protected by special gowns and masks, but the patient didn't require much in the way of treatment."He didn't require oxygen," Duffy said. "He didn't require any medication. He didn't require any other respiratory therapy at all."Hospital officials said the community's safety is of paramount concern, and there's little to worry about in this case."The community and visitors to our facility have been at virtually zero risk of contracting this disease from him," Duffy said.Duffy said other common illnesses are more of a threat to Granite Staters."Influenza still remains a far more virulent, a far more dangerous threat to our communities at this point," he said.State health officials have released little information about the other patient, including where the person is being treated. A call is scheduled for Wednesday at noon with health care providers to address the coronavirus.Officials said the person recently traveled to China and is being kept in isolation.If tests show that either patient has novel coronavirus, more information will be released, officials said.The CDC has reported five confirmed cases of the virus in the United States, while China has reported more than 4,500 cases.A Level 3 travel advisory was issued late Monday night urging Americans to postpone any travel to China, with a heightened advisory for Hubei Province, meaning Americans should not travel there at this time."Right now, there is no spread of this virus in our communities here at home," said CDC Director Robert Redfield. "This is why our current assessment is that the immediate health risk of this new virus to the general public is low in our nation."Health officials said the numbers could change in the coming days, but the goal is to contain the virus and stop it from spreading.
