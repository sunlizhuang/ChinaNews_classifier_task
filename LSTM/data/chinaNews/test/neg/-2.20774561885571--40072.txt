This latest cartoon, published in Jyllands-Posten, depicted a Chinese flag with the yellow novel coronavirus instead of stars in the upper left corner.

It was created in response to the new novel coronavirus outbreak.

Jyllands-Posten chief editor Jacob Nybroe said on Tuesday that the newspaper cannot apologise.

Nybroe said: “We cannot apologise for something we don’t think is wrong. We have no intention of being demeaning or to mock, nor do we think that the drawing does.”

“As far as I can see, this here is about different forms of cultural understanding.”

The paper also said they would not “dream of” poking fun at the situation in China but also refused to apologise.

Denmark’s free speech stance

Several Danish politicians backed the paper, including its leader.

Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, according to the Politiken newspaper, that “we have freedom of expression in Denmark”.

He also said: “Also to draw.”

China angry

China’s embassy in Denmark called the cartoon “an insult to China” that “hurts the feelings of the Chinese people”.

The embassy also said it crossed the “ethical boundary of free speech” and demanded that the paper and cartoonist Niels Bo Bojesen “reproach themselves for their mistake and publicly apologise to the Chinese people”.

Not the first controversy

In 2005, Jylland-Posten published several cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed, which led to violent protests in some Muslim countries.

The paper has been held up as a bastion of free speech.
