While the Internet has its benefits, it also has its detriments – one being the spread of false information. Unfortunately, there is a tendency among many to believe the first thing they read without logically analyzing the information in regard to its plausibility. Whether the false information is spread intentionally or not, it can lead people to erroneous, sometimes bizarre, conclusions. As a result, some people panic and/or make decisions that are counterproductive to their own well being, particularly when it comes to matters of health.

The latest example of scientific misinformation relates to the coronavirus outbreak that began in China and has now spread to several other countries. Some of the false claims posted on the Internet include: Vitamin C will cure and prevent a coronavirus, students at two Canadian universities have been quarantined, FEMA has proposed enacting martial law, the virus already has killed 112,000 people and oregano oil prevents contracting a coronavirus.

Some of the false sites are well done, such as one that mimics the Department of Health in Queensland, Australia. This site warns Australians against traveling to areas within that country in which there is a ratio of one Chinese national to every three non-Chinese Australians.

As with many fake postings, there are words misspelled or the name of the government agency is incorrect. These are minor things that some people often overlook but are telltale signs of a bogus site.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the official name of this virus is 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). It belongs to the coronavirus family, which includes the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003 and the MERS outbreak in 2012, which is still present but not prevalent.

While these previous viruses have been deadly, they have not been catastrophic. SARS infected less than 10,000 people worldwide and killed less than 800. MERS, to date, has infected less than 3,000 and killed less than 900.

As of Wednesday morning, 2019-nCoV had infected more than 6,000 people and killed over 130 in China. Most of these cases have occurred in the Chinese province of Hubei, which includes the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak apparently started. There have been five cases of 2019-nCoV reported in the United States and two in Canada. There have been no deaths outside of China.

By comparison, the regular flu killed about 80,000 Americans in the winter of 2017-2018, according to figures released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The previous high for a regular flu season from the previous three decades was 56,000 deaths.

This virus could be more deadly than SARS and MERS, but that is not yet to be known. Viruses mutate and no one knows if this will be the norm or the virus will become more deadly.

There also has been a reported shortage of medical diagnosis kits in China, so the number of people actually infected may be underreported. And, based on past experiences, the Chinese government is not the most reliable source of information, particularly if that information would make the government look bad.

On the other hand, if the numbers are fairly accurate, the virus may not be that deadly. The case fatality rate – the percentage of people who contract the disease and die from it – is around 2 percent.

Also, the U.S. government is screening Americans returning from China. Other countries are taking similar measures, including targeted travel bans, to prevent 2019-nCoV from spreading.

For the present and future, we need to remain calm and listen to what our most trusted sources – the CDC, leading epidemiologists and other medical professionals – have to say, and we need to stay away from Internet sites that spread misinformation.

In the meantime, we should go about our regular business but continue to do those things that help prevent the spread of any virus – washing our hands thoroughly in warm water, covering our mouths when we cough, and staying home and away from others when we are sick.
