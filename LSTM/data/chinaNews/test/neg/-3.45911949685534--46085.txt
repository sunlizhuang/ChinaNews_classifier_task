“There are many Europeans, 29 different nationalities, 30 with French nationality,” said Jean-Yves le Drian, France's minister of foreign affairs.

“We have assumed our responsibility in the sharing and solidarity with Europeans. The majority of them were brought back to their country of origin immediately upon their arrival in France," he added.

Le Drian hailed Chinese authoritites for assisting the departures of all French nationals who wanted to leave.

All diplomatic personnel, however, are not back in France. “If by chance there are difficult cases suspected, a medical plane will be sent,” he added the minister.

For now, the second group of evacuees will be under surveillance in the south of France where a quarantine centre has been set up.

On Saturday, the first plane sent to evacuate the first round of mainly French nationals and their spouses returned to France in the south, near Marseille.

The 179 evacuees have been sent to quarantine at a sea-side base in Carry-le-Rouet, 30 kilometres from Marseille for the next two weeks.

The isolated site is in the middle of a pine forest. There, the evacuees must continuously wear a mask and undergo regular medical checks supervised by a team of 20 doctors, nurses and psychologists.
