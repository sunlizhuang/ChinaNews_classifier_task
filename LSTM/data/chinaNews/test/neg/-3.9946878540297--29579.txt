WUHAN, CHINA—The Chinese government scrambled Monday to contain not only the coronavirus epidemic but also growing expressions of public fury over the management of the crisis as the death toll rose Tuesday to at least 106.

China’s National Immigration Administration on Tuesday encouraged Chinese citizens to reconsider the timing of overseas travel to curtail the spread of the coronavirus, it said on its WeChat account. That came as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged U.S. citizens to avoid non-essential travel to China.

Premier Li Keqiang, the prime minister of the Chinese government, flew Monday into Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, to show support for medical workers and to pledge needed medical supplies — only to be mocked online for leading workers in an encouraging cheer.

Li’s visit, which featured prominently in state media, came as Wuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, acknowledged that local authorities had moved too slowly in the first days of the crisis.

In an interview with CCTV, the main state television network, the mayor said that information about the coronavirus had not been shared with the public in a timely manner, and that he and the city’s Communist Party secretary, Ma Guoqiang, were prepared to resign to “appease public indignation.”

With the death toll rising to at least 106, and infections spreading to still more countries, the impacts reverberated globally. Stocks tumbled and oil prices fell Monday as the virus’ spread worried investors worldwide.

The S&P 500 fell 1.6 per cent, its sharpest decline in nearly four months, with shares of airlines and companies dependent on tourism from China particularly hard hit.

In China, the government announced that it would extend for three days the weeklong holiday for the Lunar New Year, which had been scheduled to end Thursday. The country’s economy, which is experiencing its worst slowdown in nearly three decades, is already hurting from the effect of the outbreak, and there are fears that consumer spending will fall as residents stay home over the extended holiday.

The U.S., Japan, France, Russia and other countries, meanwhile, scrambled to get citizens who were trapped in the city out, after the government shut down the major modes of transportation.
