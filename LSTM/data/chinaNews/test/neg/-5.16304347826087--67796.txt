South Korea gets tougher on visitors after cases in Hong Kong and Macau rise.

South Korea will impose quarantine screening of people coming from Hong Kong and Macau from today after an increase in the spread of the coronavirus in the two territories.

The same stringent screening for visitors from the mainland imposed on January 20 will be conducted for those arriving from the two SARs, including giving a phone number and address to immigration authorities.

The country's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said those arriving from Hong Kong and Macau are required to have their body temperature checked and fill out a health declaration form if they have fever or respiratory problems.

Those with symptoms will be taken for tests for the Wuhan virus.

Two of the confirmed cases imported to Seoul went to Macau after staying in Guangdong province for three months.

The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said all passengers coming from the two territories must provide their mobile number and where they are staying in South Korea at the immigration counters upon arrival.

Officers will check the contact information on the spot.

Those who fail to provide a phone number and address, or give false information, will be denied entry. Hotel numbers will not be accepted.

They must also download the "Self Diagnosis Mobile App" and record their daily health status for 14 days after arrival.

South Korea's 24th and 27th confirmed cases stayed in Guangdong for three months before going to Seoul through Macau on January 31.

Hong Kong travel agency WWPKG suggested visitors purchase a roaming service or buy a Sim card before departing for Seoul.

Meanwhile, Taiwan issued the level-three warning - the highest level - for travel to the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau, urging people not to go to the three places unless strictly necessary.

With the Taiwan restriction, the Hong Kong Education Bureau has set up a hotline (2891-0088) for students who fail to fly to the island due to tightening border controls.

Students required to undergo self-quarantine for 14 days after arriving in Taipei can call another hotline at 0963-660-632 for assistance.

Separately, around 500 Taiwanese visitors remain stranded in the Philippines after an entry ban was abruptly imposed by Manila authorities on Monday night.
