Is it just me, or is the near total silence by the New Zealand mainstream media over the revelations that an alleged Chinese Spy inside the National Party bypassed official channels to set up a meeting for the Leader of the Opposition with the Head of the bloody Secret Police and then that Leader of the Opposition heaps praise upon China?

I mean, isnâ€™t that kinda newsworthy?

When you add the extraordinary personal business relationships many National Party MPs have with Chinese businessmen, ON TOP of the direct donations from rich Chinese Businessmen to the Party, National looks less like a Political vehicle and more a front for Chinese Business interests.

Just imagine if a Labour MP was outed as a Russian spy, who then arranges for Jacinda to meet the head of the KGB and Jacinda then praised Russia.

Mike Hosking, the entire on air line up at ZB, the NZ Herald, John Armstrong, Matthew Hooton, right wing trolls, Colin the 67 year old brick layer from Christchurch, the bankers, the corporate farmers, fat bloke down pub and Christine Rankin would be openly demanding civl war to overthrow the Labour Government for Treason while printing Molotov cocktail recipes online alongside Cabinet Ministers home addresses.

Yet National do it, and the silence is deafening.

How is it that false sexual assault claims propagated by The Spinoff and Fairfax journalists can get never ending attention that damage Labour (despite being proven deceptive), yet National get a complete free pass on being a tool of a foreign power who is currently attempting to influence our entire region?
