BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- China's top political advisory body, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), on Monday held the Chairperson's Council meeting in Beijing.

Since the novel coronavirus outbreak, the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee has attached great importance to the prevention and control work, according to the meeting presided over by Wang Yang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of CPC Central Committee and chairman of the CPPCC National Committee.

Noting that the prevention and control work is still at a critical stage that allows no lax efforts, the meeting stressed the participation of political advisory bodies and advisors at all levels to win the battle.

The meeting also studied matters related to postponing the third session of the 13th CPPCC National Committee and the 10th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 13th CPPCC National Committee.
