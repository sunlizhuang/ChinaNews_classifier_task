Canada’s ambassador to China told parliamentarians on Wednesday that Canada needs to continue to engage with Beijing in order for an exit to be found to the ongoing diplomatic row.

Dominic Barton faced two hours of questioning from MPs at the special House of Commons committee on Canada-China relations on Wednesday evening, ranging on topics from the global response to the coronavirus outbreak to the business activities of McKinsey & Company, the controversial consultancy group that Barton previously headed.

Barton said Canada needs “some relevance to be able to get things done” diplomatically with Beijing and has to continue to engage with the Communist regime despite what he said was limited high-level and ministerial dialogue since relations soured in December 2018.

That month saw the RCMP arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, who faces possible extradition to the U.S. for fraud charges, and the subsequent detentions nine days later of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in China, a move widely considered as retaliatory and the Canadian government calls “arbitrary.”

Kovrig and Spavor have been detained for 14 months on accusations of spying, with only monthly access to Canadian consular officials.

The diplomatic philosophy of Barton is in contrast to what he described as a more “hardline” approach to China pushed by some people in Canada.

“The question there, I think is, just be prepared for what you ask for in that type of an approach, and I don’t think we have to go that way,” he said.

Barton said establishing regular high-level dialogue between both countries is a “key aspect of what I’ve been trying to do in China.”

Some academics and former diplomats have urged Ottawa to consider a reset to its relationship with Beijing in wake of the spat, pushing for the government to be more critical of China’s human rights record and its efforts to exert its influence geopolitically.

Barton said the bilateral relationship in which he operates in has “fundamentally changed” since Meng’s arrest.

“The chill is real,” he said.

“We’re very angry because of our people that have been taken,” he said. “China’s very angry as well about Meng, they’re furious.”

He said one of the first conversations he had with Chinese officials after receiving the ambassadorial posting “was probably one of the most unpleasant conversations that I’ve ever had.”

In his opening remarks, Barton said Canada’s overall goal is to “restore the relationship” with China, with three priorities built within.

First is securing the release of Kovrig and Spavor and clemency for Robert Schellenberg, who is facing the death penalty in China. Second is to promote and protect human rights. Third is to “deepen and broaden” ties through the arts, universities and economically.

Barton criticized for past at McKinsey

Barton was appointed ambassador by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in September, after an eight-month vacancy of the role following the firing of John McCallum in early 2019.

Barton arrived without any diplomatic experience but worked for McKinsey in Asia from 2003 to 2018. From 2009 to 2018, he served as the global managing director for the consultancy, based in Shanghai. During his tenure, McKinsey developed an extensive list of clients in China, particularly state-owned companies.

McKinsey has been criticized for doing work with companies with connections to authoritarian regimes, as well as for its own corporate practices.

Conservative MP Garnett Genuis said Barton was “a completely inappropriate choice as ambassador,” and the fact McKinsey under his leadership did work for Chinese firms raises “big red flags for me.”

One controversy he cited was from a New York Times investigation in December 2018 that revealed McKinsey held a corporate retreat close to an internment camp for Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, a province where the Chinese government is said to have detained more than one million residents in a harsh crackdown.

“I’m very proud of my career and time in the private sector, and with McKinsey and the work that we did,” Barton said, who later added that he has been “extraordinarily diligent” in properly disclosing his private holdings.

Barton claimed McKinsey was not aware of the internment camp ahead of the gathering and would not have held its retreat nearby if it had been previously informed about it.

The ambassador was also grilled for McKinsey advising a company that built Chinese military installations in the South China Sea, in violation of international law. Barton replied that just because McKinsey advised the company does not mean it built them.

Genuis told reporters after the meeting that he was disappointed in the level of detail Barton gave on his business past.

During the meeting, Liberal MP Rob Oliphant said some committee members were treating it as an “American-style confirmation hearing,” something Genuis did not agree was the case.

Bloc Québécois MP Stephane Bergeron also said MPs should not be using the meeting to undermine Barton’s reputation.

Barton had earlier said he’s observed China increasingly crack down on dissidents, both within its borders and elsewhere in the globe.

“Journalists, diplomats, and Chinese civil society representatives I spoke to agree that 2019 witnessed an increased crackdown on dissent and on expressions of disagreement about China’s human rights record, within and outside the country,” he said.

He cited the United Nations as a place where Beijing has attempted to exert its power against opponents.

Barton also praised Beijing’s effort in trying to contain the coronavirus outbreak, saying its decision to lockdown Wuhan and freeze travel during the busy holiday season has helped to prevent its spread even further.

“I commend what China is doing in trying to contain this.”
