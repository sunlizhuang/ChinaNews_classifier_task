No positive case of coronavirus reported in Rajasthan so far

JAIPUR: Twenty-four days after they returned from the troubled China’s Wuhan, the epicentre of novel coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak, three medical students were quarantined at an isolation ward in Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital on Thursday. The delay could be a major lapse in preventing nCoV in Rajasthan.Quick in defending the delay in testing, health authorities claimed that these students were not cooperating with them despite repeated efforts made to convince them.Only after chief medical health officer (CMHO) Jaipur-I Dr Narottam Sharma directed his officials in Govindgarh to convince these students for testing for nCoV, the students agreed to undergo the test. “We issued directions to get the test done of these students immediately. If required take the help of the administration (even police),” Dr Sharma told TOI.They were brought to SMS Hospital, where the doctors quarantined them after taking their blood samples.These students had reached Jaipur on January 13 and since then they have been living in Govindgarh. “Two students got their tests done some days ago but three students had refused saying they do not have any symptoms,” said Dr SK Chopra, block chief medical officer, Govindgarh.In Barmer too, health authorities had to make a lot of effort to convince people returning from Wuhan. “Five people returned from Wuhan in Barmer, all of them have been quarantined at the government hospital. Initially, these students showed resistance but they later agreed to cooperate,” said Dr Kamlesh Chaudhary, CMHO, Barmer.Besides, two more people were quarantined in Jodhpur on Thursday.So far, 51 samples of people who returned from Wuhan have been taken and out of those 43 have tested negative and report of eight tests is awaited. Moreover, 6,981 passengers who landed in Jaipur over the last 10 days have been screened. No nCoV positive case has been reported from the state so far.Rajasthan is at high-risk of nCoV as many medical students, along with others, have returned from Wuhan. At a time when Kerala has reported three confirmed nCoV cases, all those returning from Wuhan have been categorised as suspected cases for nCoV. To enforce the Centre’s direction making it mandatory for all Wuhan-returned citizens to undergo test for nCoV, health authorities are identifying such people and convincing them of taking the test.
