Xi says China fighting ‘demon’ virus as nations prepare airlifts

WUHAN, China: is battling a “demon” virus that has so far killed more than 100 people, President Xi Jinping said Tuesday, as nations readied planes to airlift foreigners trapped at the epicentre of the outbreak.

Xi made his remarks during talks with the head of the World Health Organization in Beijing amid growing global concerns about a novel coronavirus that has infected thousands in China and reached more than a dozen other countries. In a development that could cause more jitters abroad, Japan and Germany reported the first confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission outside of China. The infection is believed to have originated in a wild animal market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where it jumped to humans before spreading rapidly across the country, prompting authorities to enact drastic nationwide travel restrictions in recent days. Countries are also concerned about the fate of thousands of foreigners stuck in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people that has been sealed off by Chinese authorities in a bid to contain the disease. Tokyo deployed a plane to the virus-stricken metropolis late Tuesday that was scheduled to repatriate Japanese nationals on Wednesday, the same day that a US aircraft is expected to bring American citizens back to their homeland. France and South Korea are also planning to fly out their citizens later this week, and several other countries, including Germany, were considering doing the same.

“Chinese people are currently engaged in a serious struggle against an epidemic of a new type of coronavirus infection,” Xi told WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

“The epidemic is a demon, and we cannot let this demon hide,” the Chinese leader said, pledging that the government would be transparent and release information in a “timely” manner. His comments came after anger simmered on Chinese social media over the handling of the health emergency by local officials in central Hubei province. Some experts have praised Beijing for being more reactive and open about this crisis as compared to its handling of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2002-2003. But others say local cadres were more focused on projecting stability earlier in January than adequately responding to the outbreak during regional political meetings. Since then, the number of cases has soared — doubling to more than 4,500 in the past 24 hours.

The WHO last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global emergency, which could have prompted a more aggressive international response such as travel restrictions. Until Tuesday, all reported cases in more than a dozen countries had involved people who had been in or around Wuhan. But in Japan, a man in his 60s apparently contracted the virus after driving two groups of tourists from the city earlier in January, the health ministry said. And a 33-year-old German man contracted the disease from a Chinese colleague from Shanghai who visited Germany last week, according to health officials.
