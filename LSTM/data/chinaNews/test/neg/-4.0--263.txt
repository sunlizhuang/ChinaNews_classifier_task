The first suspected case of pneumonia, involving a 3-year-old female Chinese national with travel history to Wuhan is not linked to the pneumonia cluster in Wuhan, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Sunday (5 Jan).

It was first reported on Sat (4 Jan) that the MOH has been notified of a suspected case of pneumonia.

The involved suspect had been warded for further assessment and treatment, and was isolated as well for precautionary measure.

However, results from the epidemiological investigations, clinical assessment, and laboratory test later revealed that the suspect is not associated with the severe pneumonia cluster in Wuhan, China.

The suspect also tested negative for SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

“The cause of her pneumonia is Respiratory Syncytial Virus, a common cause for childhood respiratory infection,” MOH noted.

According to KidsHealth, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory illness in young children, which will infect the lungs and breathing passages. What’s more, it also leads to other serious illnesses such as pneumonia or bronchiolitis.

Meanwhile, Singapore is alerted on the outbreak of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, which is suspected of being linked to SARS.

While MOH continues to monitor the situation, the ministry urges the public to remain vigilant and to adopt good personal hygiene practices at all times.

“Travellers to Wuhan should monitor their health closely and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and also inform their doctor of their travel history,” MOH added.

Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and the Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan also took to his Facebook on Saturday (4 Jan) to speak on the matter. He said that although there is no evidence of people-to-people transmission, Singapore cannot be complacent.

The temperature screening has been implemented at Changi Airport from 3 Jan for all inbound travellers arriving on flights from Wuhan.

The ministry has not been notified of any new suspect cases as of 3pm on Sun (5 Jan).

However, MOH also stated that they are likely to see more suspect cases that will need to be investigated as the medical practitioners are on the lookout for pneumonia cases who have recently returned from Wuhan.
