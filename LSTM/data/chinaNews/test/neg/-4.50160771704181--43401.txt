The United States and Singapore announced travel restrictions on people who have been in mainland China for the past week, creating an operational nightmare for Qantas given many of its cabin crew would be banned to two of its key international hubs.

Mr Morrison said Australians at home should feel safe going about their normal lives as health authorities manage the threat.

"I want to assure Australians that we're doing everything that we can and through these actions to protect Australia for what is an escalating threat and a constantly changing situation," Mr Morrison said.

No departure date has been set for a flight to evacuate Australians stranded in the virus epicentre city of Wuhan, Foreign Minister Marise Payne confirmed. Talks with the Chinese government about the evacuations are ongoing.

Qantas said on Saturday It would suspend its direct services from Sydney to Shanghai and Beijing from February 9 until March 29. The Beijing service was already due to end on February 23 for commercial reasons. Qantas would continue to fly out of Hong Kong.

Qantas will suspend its Sydney-Beijing and Sydney-Shanghai services from February 9 until March 29.

Air New Zealand also said Saturday its Auckland to Shanghai services would be suspended for the same period. Nearly 10,000 flights have been suspended since the outbreak of the coronavirus in China, according to travel and data analytics firm Cirium.

The Qantas move was due to logistical challenges caused by travel bans in other countries because any of its cabin crew who had been in mainland China would not be allowed entry. This was different than the move by British Airways which cited a ban on non-essential travel to China due to health concerns.

China said on Saturday the number of deaths from the coronavirus had risen to 259, an increase of 45 over 24 hours, with 11,791 confirmed cases.

South Korea and India became the latest countries to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak. The fate of as many as 600 Australians stranded in Wuhan was unclear as the federal government tries to schedule a Qantas evacuation flight.

The United States announced new border curbs on foreign nationals who have been in China in the last 14 days. Immediate family members of American citizens and permanent residents would be exempt.

However, American citizens who had been in China's Hubei province, which is where most of China's cases have been reported, would be subject to 14 days quarantine.

China criticised Washington's travel restrictions, noting the World Health Organisation (WHO) had recommended against this. "Certainly not a gesture of goodwill," a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said.

'Suspension may be brought forward'

Singapore also said it would ban all foreign nationals who had been in China and Japan imposed restrictions for visitors who had been in Hubei.

Other flights between mainland China and Australia have not been affected, except for China Eastern's direct services to Wuhan which were suspended. Ten airlines operate between Australia and mainland China cities.

Qantas has advised its cabin crew flying to China to avoid crowds and to eat in their hotel room. They also issued crew with masks but wearing them was not mandatory..

Qantas said February 9 was selected as a balance between high passenger demand in both directions and various travel restrictions.

"The suspension may be brought forward if demand levels or other factors change," the airline said on Saturday.

"The date for flights to resume will also be regularly reviewed based on the circumstances."

Customers booked to fly from February 9 to March 29 will be contacted by Qantas to discuss options. Codeshare flights with Chinese airlines will not be changed.

Qantas said it was liaising closely with the federal government on the impact on citizens currently in mainland China, and continued to take advice from the World Health Organisation and Australia's Chief Medical Officer on coronavirus.

Calls for all China flights to be suspended

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has called on the federal government to halt flights from China as the death toll from coronavirus rises.

Ms Palaszczuk told reporters in Brisbane on Saturday that she backed "recommendations in relation to no more incoming flights until the virus is contained".

"I don't often agree with Donald Trump, but I do agree with the US authorities on this occasion that I think we should take every measure possible to combat this virus," she added.

The Transport Workers Union welcomed the move and called for all incoming flights from China to be suspended.

"This issue is getting more serious by the hour and it requires a calm but definite response," national secretary Michael Kaine said in a statement.

The province of Hubei, the centre of the epidemic, remains under virtual quarantine, with roads sealed off and public transport shut down, but small numbers of travellers continue to breach the lockdown.

Repatriations underway

Many nations have put on special charter flights to repatriate citizens from China.

More than 300 South Koreans arrived home on Saturday on a second charter flight from China and have been transported to a facility where they will be isolated for two weeks, the health ministry said. Seven people on the flight exhibited symptoms and were sent immediately to hospital.

Cities across China have continued to implement special measures aimed at curbing the spread of the pathogen. Tianjin, a city in northern China with around 15 million people, said all schools and businesses would be suspended until further notice.

The U.S.-based China Human Rights Defenders urged the Chinese government to ease restrictions on movement and counter discrimination against residents of Wuhan and Hubei, adding that censorship had contributed to the spread of the virus.

"Human rights must not be a casualty of the governmentâ€™s work to contain the coronavirus outbreak that has killed nearly 200 people and affected millions," the group said.

The World Health Organisation, which declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday, has praised China's response to the outbreak.

The United Nations has announced it has moved a key round of talks on a new biodiversity treaty originally scheduled to take place in Kunming in southwest China on February 24. The talks will now take place in Rome.

Several high-profile sporting events have also been moved or postponed, the latest a badminton Olympic qualifier in Hainan province.

Walmart, the world's largest retailer, announced it was temporarily limiting "non-business critical travel" to China, while farm equipment maker Deere & Co temporarily closed its facilities in China, the latest of dozens of major companies restricting travel and operations due to the outbreak.

China's National Health Commission said there were 2,102 new confirmed infections in China during Friday, bringing the cumulative total to 11,791.

The local health commission of Hubei province, the epicentre of the epidemic, earlier on Saturday reported 45 new deaths from the outbreak on Friday, bringing the total to 249. The other death on Friday was in the southwest city of Chongqing.

Hubei confirmed 1,347 new cases of infection on Friday, with the total reaching 7,153 by the end of the day.

Hubei's provincial capital Wuhan, where the virus is thought to have originated, reported 576 new confirmed cases over the day, and also saw 33 deaths from the virus. A total of 192 people in Wuhan have now died.
