A China-returned Bangladeshi student, who was admitted to Rangpur Medical College Hospital (RMCH) after displaying symptoms of the coronavirus, has no problems except slight pain in his chest.

RMCH’s Medicine Department chairman Dr Devendranath Sarker told journalists around 12pm on Sunday.

A medical board with 12 members was formed for the treatment of the student, he said.

Earlier on Saturday night, Tasdid Hossain, 25, was admitted to the hospital with respiratory problems. He was kept at the isolation ward of the hospital after admission.

Tasdid, a native of Mirganj village in Nilphamari’s Domar Upazila, came back home from China on January 29. He had since been living with his family in their village home. He suddenly fell ill on Saturday morning and was rushed to the hospital.

To be noted, a total of 813 people died from coronavirus across the world including China so far.
