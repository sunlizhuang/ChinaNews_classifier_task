A man is being treated in Belfast after showing symptoms of the deadly coronavirus, which has killed at least 25 people in Asia, it has emerged - while five others are being treated in Scotland.

All five are believed to have travelled from the Wuhan area of China.

At least one is thought to have flown in via London.

The Northern Irish patient is thought to be suffering from a high temperature, and members of the public first put him in isolation, the BBC reports.

Prof Juergen Haas, head of infection medicine at Edinburgh University, said he believes there will be many more cases from other cities in the UK.

The Northern Irish patient is in an isolation ward at the Royal Victoria Hospital in the Northern Irish capital.

Northern Ireland's Public Health Agency said in a statement that medics are “keeping abreast of the changing situation around the Wuhan novel Coronavirus, and is liaising with partners across the UK including Public Health England and our local Health Trusts on this issue”.

The statement continued: “As part of this, the health service here is monitoring for any potential cases of Wuhan novel Coronavirus.

"Currently no cases have been diagnosed in Northern Ireland.

“The risk to the UK population has been assessed as low. The risk to visitors to Wuhan is moderate, reflecting an increase in the number of cases being identified in China and evidence that the virus has limited spread from person to person.

"Individuals should seek medical attention if they develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of visiting Wuhan, either in China or on their return to the UK.

"They should phone ahead before attending any health services and mention their recent travel to the city.”

Authorities have suspended planes and trains in and out of the affected Chinese city of Wuhan.

The virus has spread to the US, South Korea, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand and Taiwan, and medics believe it is spread through coughing and sneezing.

Wuhan - a city of 11million people - has become a "ghost town" as it is cut off from the outside world in a desperate bid to prevent the deadly virus from spreading even further.

Flights from Wuhan to London are among those halted.

A second Chinese city, neighbouring Huanggang, which is home to seven million, has also been locked down as health authorities in China and around the world scramble to prevent a global pandemic.

The Prime Minister is being kept updated on the situation, a Number 10 spokesman said.

The patients in Scotland were suffering flu-like symptoms after arriving Britain and it is understood they travelled to the UK on a flight to London Heathrow Airport.

Infection outbreak and control measures are in place around a ward at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, where one of the patients was being treated, the Daily Record reports.

A Scottish Government spokesperson said: "There are currently no confirmed cases of Coronavirus (WN Co-V) in the UK and the risk to the Scottish public remains low.

"Following travel to Wuhan, China, two people confirmed as diagnosed with influenza are now being tested for Wuhan Novel Coronavirus as a precautionary measure only.

"A third person is also currently undergoing testing on a similar precautionary basis.

"We are co-orientating with Health Protection Scotland a daily Incident Management Team to continue to monitor the situation as it develops, including on the number of any potential cases going forward."

A source said infection outbreak and control measures have been put in place around a ward at the Glasgow hospital where one patient was being treated in isolation.

The source said: “There was no doubt that the situation was being taken seriously because of the symptoms being displayed and the specific origin of travel.

“The patient came through London to Glasgow and after the symptoms were flagged up no chances were taken.

“The tests that were carried out could not immediately isolate what the condition might be and it may take a bit longer to be absolutely sure what doctors are dealing with.

“Obviously they are erring on the side of caution in the meantime.”

Officials from Public Health England have been monitoring direct flights from Wuham city to the UK.

Under measures announced on Wednesday by the UK Government, the planes would have been taken to an isolated area of Terminal 4 at Heathrow after landing.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office updated its travel advice for China, advising against "all but essential travel" to Wuhan.

Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has insisted Britain can cope with any outbreak. Four NHS trusts in the capital have been put on standby to receive patients.

He said: “The UK is one of the first countries to have developed a world-leading test for the new coronavirus.

“The NHS is ready to respond appropriately to any cases that emerge. Clinicians have received advice on initial detection and investigation of possible cases, infection ­prevention and control and clinical diagnostics.

“It is important we get the enhanced airport monitoring right. The challenge here is that symptoms do not usually appear for up to 14 days.”

The British Medical ­Association’s Dr Peter Holden warned anybody with flu-like symptoms who fears they may have the virus not to visit A&Es or GP surgeries. He added: “If you have been to Wuhan then stay at home and ring up.

“Help will be organised to take you to somewhere we can examine you in safety.”

The Public Health Agency declined to comment on the suspected coronavirus cases.

But Nottingham University’s Professor Jonathan Ball said: “The individuals are isolated, and the diagnostic laboratory will now be testing to see if they have evidence of the novel ­coronavirus.”

They had samples taken from their nose and throat that were sent to Public Health England’s ­laboratory centre in Colindale, North West London, for analysis. Millions of people are preparing to travel east for China’s lunar new year ­celebrations, which start this weekend.

The University of Chester said it has notified students in the UK that if they return to China they will not be readmitted without a suitable quarantine period.

University of Dundee bosses warned people to be careful if receiving items, especially food, from areas where the virus is present. It runs a joint education ­partnership with Wuhan ­University, with 34 students on the programme in Dundee who arrived in September.

Five staff returned from a visit to the city last week.

Aberdeen University said it has five members of staff who have visited Wuhan since the outbreak who have returned to work. But one ­non-teaching member is “working from home as a ­precautionary measure”.

Universities have followed Foreign Office advice warning people not to travel to the region affected.

A Newcastle University spokesman said: “We have arranged a dedicated health event for any student arriving from China in the last month, ensuring they register with a doctor.”

Liverpool’s Chinese Business ­Association founder Brian Wong said he was worried about the impact of the virus “socially and economically”.

The 70-year-old added: “I’m also worried about students coming over from China to the UK if they are returning from Wuhan and those areas. We are really concerned about the new strains of the virus and there’s no remedy at the moment, right at the time of the Chinese new year.

“Traditionally, the new year is for unions, the whole family will come together so people will be travelling more.”

Two Avon and Somerset police stations were temporarily closed on Wednesday after a Chinese detainee displayed flu-like symptoms. Trinity Road in Bristol city centre and nearby Patchway shut down amid fears the person may have had contact with people who had travelled from Wuhan.
