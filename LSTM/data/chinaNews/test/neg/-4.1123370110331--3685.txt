China has labeled the United States the 'root cause' of heightened tensions in the Middle East after U.S. President Trump called on China and other nations to abandon the 'defective' Iran nuclear deal.

Beijing's Ministry of Foreign Affairs today accused Washington of ignoring international law and its international duties with the proposal.

Geng Shuang, a spokesperson of the Ministry, condemned the U.S. for pulling out of the agreement one-sidedly. He said America was applying 'extreme pressure' on Iran and 'preventing' other countries from fulfiling their responsibility.

During a daily press briefing, Mr Geng stressed the need to de-escalate tensions in the region after Iran launched missile attacks on two American bases in response to a U.S. strike that killed its top general.

He said the agreement did not come easy and was the important result of multilateral diplomacy and the pillar of peace in the Middle East.

Mr Geng called on international society to uphold the agreement in a bid to ease the situation.

'China will continue to maintain close contact and coordination with all relevant sides, and make unremitting efforts for the cause,' he added.

President Trump yesterday called on other nations to abandon the Iran nuclear deal, calling it ''very defective'.

He said that the 'time has come' for Britain, Germany, France, Russia and China to 'break away' from the accord, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

President Trump announced his decision to walk away from the nuclear deal in May, 2018, calling it 'disastrous' and an 'embarrassment.' Trump is holding a signed document reinstating sanctions against Iran after announcing the U.S. withdrawal from the deal on May 8, 2018

At a White House press conference yesterday afternoon, President Trump said the 'very defective JCPOA expires shortly anyway and gives Iran a clear and quick path to nuclear breakout'.

'Iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism.

'The time has come for the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia and China to recognise this reality.

'They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal - or JCPOA - and we must all work together towards making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place.'

The Iran nuclear deal is a detailed, 159-page agreement signed on July 14, 2015.

It was reached by Iran and six nations, including the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States â€“ as well as Germany. It was endorsed by the United Nations.

Under the deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear programme and allow in international inspectors in return for the easing of economic sanctions.

Tensions in the Middle East have heightened after Iran launched missile attack on two American bases in response to a U.S. strike that killed its top general Qassem Suleimani. In the picture above, people protest against the death of the general while holding his portrait

President Trump announced his decision to walk away from the deal in May, 2018, calling it 'disastrous' and an 'embarrassment.'

He said at the time that the U.S. had 'definitive proof' that Iran was lying about its pursuit of nuclear weapons when it entered into the 2015 agreement.

A year later, Iran said it would withdraw partially from the deal. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said he wanted to re-negotiate the terms.

Hours before President Trump's remarks yesterday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the deal remained the 'best way of preventing nuclear proliferation in Iran'.

He told MPs during Prime Minister's Questions: 'It is the best way of encouraging the Iranians not to develop a nuclear weapon - and we think that after this crisis has abated, which of course we sincerely hope it will, that way forward will remain.

'It is a shell that has currently been voided, but it remains a shell into which we can put substance again.'

The European Union also said yesterday that it 'will spare no efforts' in its attempts to keep alive the international deal.

EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said her foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell would continue to work 'in the midterm' to reach out to all participants in the global deal in the hopes that the 2015 nuclear agreement could still be saved despite a rollback on commitments from Tehran.
