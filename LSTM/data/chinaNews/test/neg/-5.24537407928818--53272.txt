Two Australians have caught the coronavirus on a cruise ship in Japan, and there are fears more than 200 others have been exposed to the deadly disease.

The Diamond Princess cruise ship has almost 3700 passengers and crew in quarantine off the coast of Yokohama, after an infected passenger flew from Wuhan to Tokyo and spread the disease to others on board.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has confirmed it is aware of the situation, and is urgently seeking information on the welfare of the Australians on board.

The ship has been placed in quarantine for 14 days, and the infected passengers are being treated on mainland Japan.
