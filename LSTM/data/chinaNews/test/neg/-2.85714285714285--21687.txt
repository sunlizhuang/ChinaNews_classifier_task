The manager of infectious diseases with the Porcupine Health Unit says the agency has been in daily contact with federal health authorities and is monitoring any developments arising from the rapid spread of coronavirus.

“I think for now the risk to people in Ontario is fairly low,” said Lynn Leggett, the health unit’s manager of infectious diseases and clinical services. “We are monitoring the situation with our provincial and Canadian counterparts and we’re in communication with them daily to discuss updates from the World Health Organization.

“For now, we have not had any cases in Canada but I think we still need to be prepared. Here at the Porcupine Health Unit we have to make sure we really communicate well with our health-care sector and provide them with information they need to be able to identify if we were to have any cases that are in Timmins.

“I know that we learned a lot from SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) 17 years ago and we’re much better prepared to respond to a new, novel virus in the community.”

Leggett said through these daily teleconferences, “We receive updates on cases … any new information that’s coming from the affected countries, other updates on how the province is going to respond, so there might be some guidance documents provided for screening of individuals who come into hospital settings with similar symptoms.

“But the key here is we’re looking for people that have travelled to the affected area.”

At this point, Leggett is not aware of plans to develop a vaccine for coronavirus.

“However, the precautions that people should take are the same precautions you would take during regular influenza season,” she said. “So it’s really making sure you wash your hands when you cough; if you’re sick with flu-like symptoms stay home and to make sure any commonly touched surfaces are properly disinfected. So it’s the same messaging we give during regular influenza season.”

At least 17 people have died in China from coronavirus with 500 confirmed cases being reported in that country. The city at the centre of the outbreak, Wuhan, is under quarantine as health officials scramble to understand the mysterious disease and keep it from spreading.

As of Thursday, there were still no confirmed cases in Canada though Federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu several people in Canada were under observation for signs they may have contracted a coronavirus.

The head of Quebec’s public health authority said five people in that province who had recently travelled to China were currently under surveillance for possible exposure.

Leggett said anyone who is planning on travelling should check to see if the federal government has issued any travel advisories concerning coronavirus.
