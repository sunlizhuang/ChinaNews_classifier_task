"A bigger outbreak is certain," said Guan Yi, a virologist who helped identify severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. He estimated - "conservatively," he said - that this outbreak could be 10 times bigger than the SARS epidemic because that virus was transmitted by only a few "super spreaders" in a more defined part of the country.

"We have passed through the 'golden period' for prevention and control," he told Caixin magazine from self-imposed quarantine after visiting Wuhan. "What's more, we've got the holiday traffic rush and a dereliction of duty from certain officials."

The Lunar New Year holiday, a week-long period when millions of Chinese travel to their hometowns, forming the biggest human migration on the planet, officially begins on Friday.

Authorities initially said that the virus, which began in a Wuhan food market selling exotic animals for consumption, was mild and could not be transmitted between humans. But that changed this week when the numbers of people infected by the virus, which has an incubation period as long as 14 days, began to rise rapidly.

Even one of the government's top experts, who had played down the prospects for widespread infection, contracted the virus.

Now cases have been detected around the country, from Harbin in the north to Shenzhen in the south. The Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macao have both reported cases, as have countries including the United States, Japan, South Korea and Thailand.

Airports around the world, from London to Dubai to Atlanta, have put special screening measures in place to detect passengers arriving from China with fevers.

Among the new measures introduced Thursday night, Beijing said that it was restricting public gatherings over the Lunar New Year holiday, which official begins on Friday and is often celebrated with large fireworks displays and popular fairs at temples.

"In order to comply with epidemic prevention and control works, and to put people's lives, safety, and health in the first place, mass gatherings should be reduced in order to ensure a harmonious and peaceful Spring Festival," the Beijing Culture and Tourism Bureau said in a statement.

"It is decided that Beijing will cancel all large-scale events, including temple fairs, effective from today," it said.

The Forbidden City, the old imperial palace in the heart of Beijing and one of China's top tourist attractions, said it would close its doors until further notice "in order to avoid cross-infection caused by the gathering of people".

Authorities in Wuhan announced even more stringent measures. In addition to banning public gatherings, local officials, wearing masks, announced that the start of the spring semester at all Hubei province schools would be delayed because of the outbreak.

In Zhejiang province, home to 57 million people and tech giants like Alibaba, put out a notice requiring the public "to reduce public gatherings to the maximum extent".

The organs of China's authoritarian state are creaking under the strain.

The ruling Communist Party, which initially tried to show transparency after being criticised for covering up the SARS virus outbreak 17 years ago, has now shown signs of reverting to its default position of censoring bad news.

In a post that was online for less than an hour, the Wuhan Health Commission admitted Thursday that it was struggling under the strain of the outbreak.

"At present, there is an obvious increase in the number of patients with fever in the city, and it is true that there are long queues and a shortage of beds in fever clinics," the commission said.

A post from Wuhan Railway saying that 300,000 people travelled by train out of Wuhan on Wednesday, headed to every corner of the country, was also quickly deleted.

Analysts said the heavy-handed reaction underscored the political risks for Chinese leader Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party, already under pressure amid an economic slowdown and accused of mishandling an outbreak of swine flu last year, which led to a sharp spike in prices for China's beloved pork.

"This outbreak may be the biggest threat to Xi and the Party in years, which is why they will stop at nothing to try to control and then eradicate it," said Bill Bishop, publisher of the influential Sinocism newsletter.

The central Chinese city of Wuhan pulsated with fear and anger Thursday, as 11 million people awoke to news that they were being confined to a metropolis-sized quarantine zone designed to contain a widening coronavirus outbreak.

The three main railway stations, 13 bus stations, the entire subway network and almost all city bus lines were shut down at 10am Thursday. Half of the 566 flights scheduled at Wuhan's international airport for Thursday were cancelled, as were 251 ferry sailings on the Yangtze River, according to the Wuhan Transportation Bureau.

Many people flocked to the roads to try to avoid getting caught in the quarantine. Television footage showed health workers in hazmat suits taking motorists' temperatures as they waited at toll booths.

Others did not make it out. Hubei's highway management authority closed multiple expressways in and around Wuhan, and Wuhan traffic police confirmed that while vehicles were allowed to come into the city, they were prohibited from going out except in special cases.

Neighboring Huanggang said it would join Wuhan's quarantine from midnight on Thursday, shutting down transport networks and telling people they should not leave the city without special reason. Nearby Ezhou announced it would close its railway stations "to efficiently cut off channels for spreading the virus".

A raft of Chinese companies, both public and private, began to impose their own travel restrictions to try to avoid infection. CITIC Securities, China's largest investment bank, told employees from Hubei province not to return home for the holidays. It said that if they did, they would have to work remotely for 14 days before being allowed back into the office.

Other measures were taken to limit public gatherings.

English tests scheduled for next month were cancelled, and film companies delayed the release of seven blockbuster movies that were expected to attract big crowds over the Spring Festival holiday, which officially starts Friday.

"Everyone wishes for peace and health," the producers of "Detective Chinatown 3" said, announcing the delay. "In the face of the virus, our wills are united like a fortress. We will cooperate hand in hand, and we will overcome difficulties together."

In Macao, where one case has been found, the government said it might shut down the territory's casinos if the epidemic worsens. Macao's gambling sector is seven times the size of Las Vegas's. The authorities have already called off a public festival to ring in the new year.

In Wuhan, a city with about 3 million more people than New York, many residents were incensed at the sudden announcement of the travel restrictions on Thursday.

"I didn't even receive a notice," said one woman who found herself stranded at Hankou Station. She had been on her way from Henan province southwest to Sichuan and was changing trains in Wuhan when she got caught up in the suspension.

She said indignantly that she would go back to Henan. But when a reporter asked how, she conceded that she did not know.

Others interpreted the fact that the health authorities announced the travel ban at 2.30am as a sign that the outbreak was more serious than they were letting on.

"The notice shouldn't come out so late, when everyone's asleep," said Jeffrey Yang, a 27-year-old Wuhan local working in the financial industry. "It makes people panic and feel like they've missed the opportunity to change their fate."

Yang had planned to leave Wuhan on Friday to join his parents in the southern coastal city of Beihai to celebrate the new year. After a friend called to warn him, he managed to get a flight out before the travel ban came into force. But when he arrived at his destination, the hotel owner refused to allow him to check in after hearing that he had travelled from Wuhan.

"I feel quite nervous," he said. "I think there must be some things about this virus that remain undisclosed."
