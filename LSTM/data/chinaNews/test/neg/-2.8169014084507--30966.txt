LONDON: The British government on Tuesday (Jan 28) approved a limited role for Huawei in the country's 5G network in spite of the US pressure, local media reported.

The British government said it will allow Chinese telecoms giant to play a role in developing the country's 5G telecoms networks.

It says it will exclude Huawei and other "high-risk vendors" from "sensitive 'core' parts of 5G and gigabit-capable networks."

The Chinese firm says it is "reassured" by the government's decision, which came despite pressure from the United States to ban Huawei from 5G networks.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested on Monday that compromise is possible over a role for Chinese telecom giant Huawei in developing Britain's 5G networks, amid US pressure to bar the company from contracts.

Johnson's government said the National Security Council will meet to discuss the issue, following a Financial Times report that it is set to announce a "restricted" role for Huawei.

Speaking during a visit to Kingâ€™s College London, Johnson told reporters it was possible to utilise "fantastic technology" for 5G networks without jeopardising Britain's security relationship with the United States and other partners.

"The way forward for us, clearly, is to have a system that delivers for people in this country the kind of consumer benefits that they want through 5G technology, or whatever, but does not in any way compromise our critical national infrastructure, our security, or jeopardize our ability to work together with other intelligence powers around the world," he said.

"So the Five Eyes security relationships we have, we've got to keep them strong and safe," Johnson said. - Xinhua/dpa/Asian News Network
