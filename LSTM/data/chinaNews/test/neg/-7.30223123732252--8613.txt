The Iran hostage crisis was a diplomatic standoff between the US and Iran, which lasted 444 days between November 4, 1979, and January 20, 1981. It began after the Iranian Revolution overthrew the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, an ally to the US. After Shah Pahlavi was ousted he was admitted to the US for cancer treatment, later being granted asylum, while Iran demanded his return in order to stand trial for crimes that he was accused of committing during his reign.

As a result, a group of Iranian college students who supported the revolution, seized the US embassy in Tehran, in what was described as an act of "blackmail" of which the hostages were "victims of terrorism and anarchy,” by President Jimmy Carter. The History Channel's “Iran Hostage Crisis” documentary explained the details behind Iran’s fury. The series said in 2017: “In 1953, the US helped topple Iran’s elected Prime Minister, replacing him with Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, also known as the Shah. “He was friendly to US interests, particularly when it came to oil, but was not very popular in Iran.

“He was a brutal dictator and his infamous secret police terrorised, tortured and killed people. “Opposition to the Shah grew and grew and, in January 1979, he and his family left Iran and by the spring of that year, a religious leader – Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini – took power. “Khomeini established a new government, the Islamic Republic, and this new government had no love for the United States.” The documentary went on to reveal how the problem had been building up for a while before the Shah was granted access to the US. It added: “They staged demonstrations outside the US embassy in Tehran, trouble was brewing. READ MORE: 'Not consulted!' US President's fury with UK after Middle East intervention revealed

“But after leaving Iran, the Shah bounced around from country to country, but after a cancer diagnosis he wanted to come to the United States to receive the best medical care. “President Jimmy Carter didn’t want to admit the Shah but relented under pressure. “The Shah arrived at a New York hospital on October 22, 1979, but giving shelter to the Shah angered the Iranian revolutionists a lot. “On November 4, 1979, a huge mob of protesters attacked the US embassy in Tehran, they took 63 people working at the embassy prisoner, then three more were taken hostage later.” According to claims from John Limbert, the former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Iran, he and the other hostages were tortured.

The series continued: “13 days later, the Ayatollah ordered the release of 13 hostages, leaving 53 and another was released on medical grounds, but from then on the remaining 52 were held for 444 days. “No hostages were killed, but they weren’t treated well either, with some beaten with rubber hoses, hung over elevator shafts and several were victim to a mock execution. “Back in the States, the hostage situation gripped the public and the US government demanded the release, but the Iranians wanted The Shah. “US froze Iranian assets held in American banks, but still the Iranians didn’t budge.” The crisis reached a climax after diplomatic negotiations failed to win the release of the hostages, sending warships to the waters near Iran, alongside a rescue helicopter which crashed killing eight US servicemen on board.

John Limbert gave a chilling account of torture

The documentary added: “In April 1980, President Carter authorised a military rescue mission known as Operation Eagle Claw, but poor weather and mechanical failures doomed the mission leaving the US embarrassed on the world stage. “Carter was in an election and his opponent, Ronald Reagan, pounced on him for being weak, and when election day rolled around the hostages were still being held captive with no end in sight. “Reagan defeated Carter and by the start of 1981, the Iranian government started to feel the pressure from the international community to release the hostages. “US and Iran went back to the bargaining table, in exchange for lifting the embargo, Iran agreed to release their prisoners. “Just hours after Ronald Reagan took the oath of office in January 1981, the American hostages were freed.”
