MOSCOW, February 11. /TASS/. Nissan may temporarily halt assembling cars at its Russian plant in St. Petersburg due to coronavirus-related shortages of Chinese-made components, a company spokesperson told TASS.

"The situation is as follows: we are now assessing the risks. There is a possibility of halting production in March if Chinese plants do not resume production on February 17 as was promised. But there is only a possibility of a temporary halt. If they [Chinese manufacturers] resume their work on schedule, everything will be fine," the source said.

At present, the car plant in St. Petersburg is working in normal regime.

"For the time being, we have plenty of everything, of all automobile components," the spokesperson added.

Russian truck maker Kamaz also said it might adjust its production plan if the novel coronavirus infection continues to spread in China and other countries that produce parts for Kamaz. The company said it continued assessing risks, but had a sufficient stock of Chinese-made components.
