NAPA COUNTY, CA — Napa County Public Health officials said Friday they are working alongside local, regional, state and federal health agencies to closely monitor the 2019 Novel Coronavirus that originated in the Wuhan, Hubei Province of China and has claimed hundreds of lives and sickened thousands as it rapidly spreads on an international level.

The first Bay Area case of the new coronavirus was reported Friday in Santa Clara County, but to date no cases have been reported or confirmed in Napa County, officials said in a news release.

"While this is considered a serious public health threat, based on current information, the risk to the general public in Napa County is considered low at this time," Napa County Spokesman Noel Brinkerhoff said.

The case in Santa Clara County is one of three confirmed cases in California and seven in the United States as of Friday. The Santa Clara County resident recently returned from traveling to Wuhan, China.

"This news is not unexpected," Dr. Sara Cody, health officer for Santa Clara County, said in a news release. "Santa Clara County has the largest population in the Bay Area, and many of our residents travel for both personal and business reasons."

The local man sickened by the new coronavirus is "self-isolating at home" and has not gone out into public except to visit the doctor, Santa Clara County officials said. He reportedly went to a local clinic and hospital — the exact locations were not disclosed — but was not hospitalized and as of Friday was doing well.



Travel Health Notice

All travelers arriving from China are being monitored for the illness by federal health officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has issued a Travel Health Notice, and recommends avoiding all nonessential travel to China.

In Southern California, 195 passengers who arrived on a flight from Wuhan, China are quarantined at March Air Force Base in Riverside for 14 days.

Cases have been confirmed in Arizona, Illinois and Washington, and more U.S. cases are likely to be reported in the coming days and weeks.

All but one of the U.S. cases involve people who traveled from Wuhan, China. One of the Chicago cases was a result of person-to-person spread from another confirmed case. Cases have also been confirmed in 26 countries.

"We are monitoring the situation closely and preparing rapidly to protect the health of Napa County residents and limit the spread of this virus," Napa County Health Officer Dr. Karen Relucio said.



"We are working with closely with health care partners to review testing and infection control procedures and communicating with community partners and are prepared to take action should someone in our county become infected with this virus," Relucio said.

What Is A Coronavirus?

Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses common among animals and humans. In rare cases, animal coronaviruses can be transmitted to humans. This newly discovered coronavirus — 2019-nCov — was not previously detected in animals or humans. The source of 2019-nCov is not yet known. Person-to-person spread of 2019-nCov is currently occurring.

What Are The Symptoms?

Typically, human coronaviruses cause mild-to-moderate respiratory illness. Symptoms are very similar to the flu, including runny nose, headache, cough, sore throat, fever, and/or shortness of breath. Older adults and people with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk for severe disease.

Anyone in Napa County who has recently traveled from China, or has come in close contact with someone who traveled from China, and develops a fever and lower respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or shortness of breath within 14 days after leaving the area, should first call their health-care provider and share travel history and symptoms before visiting the clinic or emergency room.

"Healthcare providers should call Napa County Public Health immediately," Brinkerhoff said.

Tips To Protect Yourself, Others

No additional precautions are recommended at this time beyond simple daily precautions everyone should always take, such as:

Washing hands with liquid soap and water, and rubbing for at least 20 seconds; Covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing; and Staying home if you are sick.

Since flu activity continues to remain high this flu season, and symptoms of coronavirus are similar to the flu, Napa County Public Health also recommends getting a flu shot, Brinkerhoff said.

"This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation, and the information contained in this press release may change quickly," Brinkerhoff said.
