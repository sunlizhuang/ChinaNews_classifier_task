Some of the Americans fleeing the coronavirus outbreak in China will fly into a San Diego military base this week, congressional leaders announced Sunday.

According to a statement issued Sunday by Rep. Scott Peters, who represents San Diego’s 52nd Congressional District, the group will arrive at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and be quarantined for 14 days to ensure they do not pose a health risk to the public. The statement initially said passengers would arrive Monday, but Peters’ staff has since said the arrival date and number of passengers is unknown.

“I will continue to monitor the situation closely, and I am requesting a public briefing from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to provide San Diegans with the most updated information,” Peters said in the statement.

U.S. health officials declared a public health emergency Friday and requested that military facilities, capable of housing at least 250 people in individual rooms, be used to accommodate those who may need to be quarantined.

In response to the request, the U.S. Department of Defense approved Saturday the use of four military facilities throughout the country, including MCAS Miramar, to accept and temporarily house U.S. diplomats and citizens returning from China who may have been exposed to the illness, which has sickened more than 14,500 people in Asia and killed at least 300.

The other three are the 168th Regiment, Regional Training Institute, Fort Carson, Colo.; Travis Air Force Base, Calif.; and Lackland Air Force Base, Texas.

The coronavirus outbreak was first detected in December in the industrial city of Wuhan, located in the Hubei province of central China.

The State Department is warning Americans not to travel to China and to consider leaving if they are already there. There have been nine confirmed cases in the U.S., two of which were identified in Santa Clara County.

According to Peters’ statement, the passengers who arrive at Miramar will have already been screened twice for signs of the flu-like virus, which causes pneumonia and other respiratory problems, with their additional 14-day quarantine ensuring their re-entry will not lead to further cases.

“As we continue to learn more, I urge everyone to follow CDC guidelines,” Peters said. “There have been no confirmed cases of the virus within San Diego, Poway or Coronado.”

MCAS Miramar officials said Saturday that the passengers will be given food, water, lodging and sundries while at the base and receive medical care if required. The Health and Human Services Department would also be responsible for all transportation and security of the evacuees.

Nearly 200 Americans already are quarantined at the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside after being evacuated from Wuhan. None has shown signs of illness, but symptoms can take up to two weeks to manifest.
