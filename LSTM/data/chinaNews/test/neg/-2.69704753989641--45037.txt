About 1,000 Americans evacuated from China and at risk of contracting the deadly coronavirus will be quarantined at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland and three other military installations in the United States.

The Department of Health and Human Services and Pentagon agreed to house at least 250 people at Lackland, military officials said Saturday.

The evacuees could arrive in San Antonio over the next few days. They will remain here through the end of the month.

“This action is a precautionary and preventative step to maximize the containment of the virus in the interest of the health of the American public,” the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

Coronavirus has been declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization and President Donald Trump, who on Friday barred non-U.S. citizens who recently visited China from entering the United States.

The ban does not apply to Hong Kong and Macau.

There were eight confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States as of Saturday.

Two were in Illinois, three in California and one each in Washington, Arizona and Massachusetts, health officials said.

The University of Massachusetts at Boston told its campus community that one of its students had contracted coronavirus.

The CDC issued federal quarantine orders for Americans returning to the United States from China’s Hubei province, where the outbreak originated. The quarantine applies even to travelers who have no symptoms of the virus. It is described as precautionary.

At Lackland, evacuees will be quarantined at hotel rooms on the base, spokeswoman Maj. Kim Bender said. She said those who had been in Wuhan would remain under quarantine for 14 days.

San Antonio City Manager Erik Walsh, in a memo Saturday to Mayor Ron Nirenberg and the City Council, said that “while this situation poses a very serious global public health threat, based on what we know at this time, we believe the risk to us here in the San Antonio community is currently low.”

An Air Force statement said JBSA personnel will not be in direct contact with the evacuees and that those flown from China to the United States will not have access beyond their housing. The Pentagon said evacuees could be sent to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and Travis AFB, both in California, and Fort Carson, Colo., as well as Lackland.

While the military will provide housing, the Department of Health and Human Services will manage care, transportation and security for those evacuated from China. The Pentagon said anyone falling ill with the virus would be transported to civilian hospitals.

The decision follows an evacuation flight out of Wuhan carrying about 200 State Department employees, dependents and U.S. citizens. They landed Wednesday at March Air Reserve Base in Ontario, Calif. They, too, will live under quarantine in base housing.

The CDC said that early on in the outbreak in Wuhan, many patients had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting an animal-to-human spread. The agency said that a growing number of patients had no exposure to animal markets, suggesting the virus now is being transmitted person-to-person.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Friday that there were “a lot of unknowns” with the coronavirus,” including how it spreads between people. As it travels around the world, however, more is being learned.

“As you can see just from the media, the number of cases has steeply inclined each and every day. You know that, in the beginning, we were not sure if there were asymptomatic infection, which would make it a much broader outbreak than what we’re seeing. Now we know for sure that there are,” he said. “It was not clear whether an asymptomatic person could transmit it to someone while they were asymptomatic. Now we know from a recent report from Germany that that is absolutely the case.”

So far, more than 60 million people in China have been quarantined. The Hubei Province Health Commission on Saturday announced 45 new deaths from coronavirus, raising the toll to at least 304.

All the deaths have occurred in mainland China. In addition, 1,921 cases of the virus were reported in Hubei province, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in China to 13,742 out of 13,874 confirmed cases worldwide.

The White House said late last week that 114 cases have been confirmed across 22 other countries. In several of those cases, it said, the victims had not visited China.

“The most recent case had no travel history to China but was a close personal contact of one of the previous cases that we had identified through our aggressive contact tracing,” the CDC’s director, Dr. Robert Redfield, said Friday at the White House. “In addition, there are currently 191 individuals that are under investigation.”

Symptoms include mild to severe respiratory illness with fever, coughing and shortness of breath. The first signs of illness can occur as soon as two days after exposure to the virus or as long as 14 days, the CDC said.

CDC advises people to avoid those who might have been exposed to the virus and wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol.

Those with flu symptoms are urged to see a doctor, calling ahead to report symptoms, and to avoid contact with other people. Those developing symptoms that include coughing or shortness of breath within 14 days of traveling to China also should seek medical help.

Those in close contact with someone having those symptoms should call a doctor immediately.

The Pentagon said that although the “immediate risk” of the virus to Americans is low, people should get flu shots and take influenza antivirals if necessary. Those in the health profession were advised to be on the lookout for people with a history of traveling to China and exhibiting fever and respiratory infection.

The State Department recently adjusted its travel advisory for China to a Level 4, meaning individuals should not travel there. The U.S Indo-Pacific Command has restricted all Defense Department travel to China for military, civilian employees and contractors.

The CDC adjusted its travel advisory as well, recommending people avoid all nonessential travel to China.

Fauci said such measures are being taken to minimize the risk of a coronavirus outbreak in the United States.

“We still have a low risk to the American public, but we want to keep it at a low risk,” he said. “And because there are so many unknowns here, we’re going … to make sure we mitigate, as best as we possibly can, this risk.”
