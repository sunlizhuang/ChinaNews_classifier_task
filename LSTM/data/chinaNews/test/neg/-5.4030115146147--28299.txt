CLOSE Coronavirus has spread from Wuhan, China, to countries across the world. But how do you know you have it? Here are some signs to watch out for. USA TODAY

In today's fast-paced world, people travel globally, making it much harder to keep a virus localized. That fact of life has recently been driven home by efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, which began in Wuhan, China.

Last week, Chinese officials shut down travel to and from Wuhan as well as two neighboring cities and canceled Lunar New Year celebrations in an attempt to prevent coronavirus from spreading.

As of Friday afternoon, the new coronavirus had sickened more than 9,600 people across China, and 213 people had died.

"All U.S. cases traveled from Wuhan, China," the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told USA TODAY in a statement. "More cases may be identified. However, (the) risk to (the) U.S. general public is still considered low."

Southwest Airlines scare

Southwest Airlines, which does not fly to or from China, confirmed to USA TODAY that a passenger on a flight from Las Vegas to Baltimore was evaluated by local health workers upon arrival in Maryland Saturday.

"Local medical personnel met Flight 2889 once it arrived at the Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport from Las Vegas on Saturday due to reports of an ill customer," Southwest spokesman Dan Landson said in a statement to USA TODAY. "Out of an abundance of caution, and in light of the recent concerns of the coronavirus, our Crew followed recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control for responding to concerns to ensure the customer, and those traveling with them, receive the assistance or support they may need."

Later, Maryland Department of Health spokeswoman Maureen C. Regan told USA TODAY that although the passenger had recently been to Beijing, the person did not meet the CDC's criteria for a positive diagnosis and was released.

How can passengers and airline crews protect themselves from coronavirus?

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe infections such as pneumonia, Middle East respiratory syndrome (known as MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Initial symptoms of the virus include fever, cough and difficulty breathing. But in more severe cases, an infection can cause pneumonia, kidney failure or death.

One of the first lines of defense is the monitoring of passengers and crew flying in from areas where the virus is active. The virus has caused the United States and several other countries to begin this monitoring process.

The CDC has set up screening centers at five major U.S. airports (Los Angeles International, San Francisco International, Chicago O'Hare, New York JFK and Atlanta) to check passengers arriving from the affected region in China. The CDC has also published a list of precautions for travelers.

Because most coronaviruses are spread through airborne droplets (sneezing or coughing), touching or touching an infected surface, hand washing is an effective way of reducing the potential for infection.

While the CDC does not discourage healthy people from wearing surgical masks as a precaution, the agency is only recommending their use for patients thought to have the virus and the medical professionals who interact with them.

American Airlines said Friday that it had agreed to allow flight attendants to wear surgical masks if they are working on flights to Hong Kong, Beijing or Shanghai, following a call from the Association of Professional Flight Attendants for more crew safeguards.

If a passenger experiences symptoms of the virus, which is officially known as 2019-nCoV, he or she is advised to call ahead to their doctor or emergency room and then seek medical attention immediately. If infected, the person should be isolated, wear a face mask and frequently wash their hands to reduce the likelihood of spreading the virus.

In its guidelines for cabin crews, the CDC recommends airline personnel wash their hands frequently and use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

If a passenger exhibits symptoms (fever exceeding 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, a persistent cough or difficulty breathing while in flight, the CDC says flight attendants should offer the person a surgical mask, keep the sick person at least 6 feet away from other passengers and designate one staffer to tend to them.

The designated caretaker should wear a surgical mask, eye protection and a gown over their uniform. All bodily fluids should be treated as if they are infectious, and afterward, all disposable items that came in contact with the passenger should be put in a biohazard bag for proper disposal. Then, all contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected in accordance with airline protocol.

Upon arrival, CDC staff will evaluate the passenger to determine whether he or she should be transported to a hospital for further tests and treatment.

"CDC will update the airline about the results of the testing and any need for follow-up of exposed crew members or passengers," the documentation says.

What we've learned from past viral outbreaks

Outbreaks of contagious viruses require careful monitoring by all flight operations, regulators and the World Health Organization.

In 2002 and 2003, there was a large outbreak of SARS , which originated in Asia and resulted in flight disruptions, the monitoring of passengers and the detention of people that were potentially exposed to the virus. Sound familiar?

That's because many flight operations teams updated their procedures for future epidemics or pandemics based on what they learned from the SARS epidemic. (An epidemic is when large numbers of people are infected at the same time in an area, which may spread to the wider world. A pandemic is when an epidemic spreads throughout the world. As of late last week, the World Health Organization said coronavirus does not yet represent a pandemic.)

Ultimately, SARS did not become a pandemic, either. However, it did infect more than 8,000 people and the CDC attributed more than 700 deaths to the virus.

The spread of the SARS virus made it necessary for airlines and other flight operations centers to quickly coordinate with local health authorities in order to know how to effectively react. Those team efforts didn't always go smoothly.

Today, there are better procedures in place because their emergency response plans include checklists and processes for dealing with potential epidemics and pandemics. Accordingly, airlines and other flight operations teams are carefully monitoring passengers for signs of any spread of this virus and reporting possible cases to the CDC and local public health officials.

Should coronavirus become more widespread, more airports could be affected. But the reality is it's still too early to tell what the extent of 2019-nCoV will be. In the meantime, we all can be aware of the symptoms, pay attention to the news and follow the CDC's guidelines and situation reports.
