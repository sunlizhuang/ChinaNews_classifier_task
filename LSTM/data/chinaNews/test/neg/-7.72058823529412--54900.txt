Massachusetts companies, many still reeling from the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, are starting to feel the impact of travel restrictions meant to stop the coronavirus outbreak.

In an interview Wednesday, John R. Regan, president and chief executive officer of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, quoted member company, saying: “The country is closed. There is really nothing (the Massachusetts employer) can do.”

Regan met with editors and reporters at The Republican to talk about the 3,500-member statewide business organization’s priorities and concerns.

He said the Massachusetts employer is dealing with the shutdown of two Chinese factories. The Chinese government has extended quarantines and travel restrictions, originally set to expire Monday, for at least another week.

The Chinese city of Wuhan, with a population of 11 million, is on lockdown, according to a number of news outlets.

“You’re really not supposed to be on the highway,” Regan said. “We are only now starting to see the spillover effect.”

Part of the impact is that executives from the United States cannot travel to China on business.

The virus comes after Massachusetts employers have spent years adjusting to an ongoing trade war that has seen import and export duties rise rapidly.

"Let's face it, one of the biggest challenges for a business is uncertainty," Regan said.

Regan’s observation echoed Tuesday’s MassBenchmarks report from the University of Massachusetts Donahue Institute, which warned that the coronavirus has added uncertainty to many business’ plans.

The virus has already hurt the stock market and driven down oil prices on fear of an economic slowdown.

In Springfield CRRC MA says that it is abiding by all travel restrictions outlined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and that the outbreak has not had an impact on its operations, said spokeswoman Lydia Rivera. The Chinese-owned factory makes rail cars and the shells and some components come by sea from China.
