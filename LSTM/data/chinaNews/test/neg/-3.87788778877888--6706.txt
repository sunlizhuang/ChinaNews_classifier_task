Have a look at a magazine stand and you’ll see a wall of liberal women. Elizabeth Warren smiles from the cover of Rolling Stone. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is on the front of New York.

Last, but not least, Nancy Pelosi is resplendent on the cover of Time.

“Her Gamble” is the cover line. “Why Nancy Pelosi went all in against Trump.”

Well, New York’s cover girl is the answer, but more on that later.

The real question is: Why does the Washington media give the speaker a free pass?

Her impeachment gambit has flopped. She has united Republicans around President Trump in an election year, electrified his base and allowed him to run again as an outsider, quite some feat for a sitting president.

It has cost her a member, fed-up New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew, who defected to the Republicans.

And it’s tanking in swing-state polls. The latest Des Moines Register survey found 48 percent of Iowa voters say Trump should not be removed from office, while just 40 percent say he should.

Now Pelosi’s three-week delay in sending articles of impeachment to the Senate has been exposed as a ditzy ploy which only raised the ire of hard-headed colleagues such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein.

Sunday, on ABC’s “This Week,” Pelosi tried to put a positive spin on her miscalculation, making the extraordinarily statement that the president is “impeached for life.”

Asked if the House would file new articles of impeachment, she said, “Let’s just see what the Senate does.”

This is permanent impeachment as a political weapon, an unprincipled tactic by a speaker with delusions of grandeur.

So much for the pretense that impeachment had to be rushed through before Christmas without subpoenaing important witnesses because the president is a “clear and present danger.”

Maybe Pelosi hoped, if she procrastinated long enough, the evidence she didn’t have would materialize from her friends in the media. She clutched yesterday at the damp squib of John Bolton’s announcement he might testify.

But with the Iowa caucuses just three weeks away and the nation’s attention drawn to weightier issues such as Iran and the trade deal the president will sign with China on Wednesday, Pelosi had no choice.

She had to capitulate without a single concession from her sphinx-like Senate Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, and she’ll be sending the articles over this week.

What a humiliation.

Yet this is a woman hailed as a master strategist.

Time’s story features black and white photographs of a fierce Pelosi backlit with a halo, like some sanctified Boadicea. She has “established herself as counterweight and constrainer of this divisive president,” it gushes, amid descriptions of her “elegant office in the Capitol [with] gold-upholstered armchairs around a low table topped with a vase of hydrangeas” [and] of her airy Georgetown penthouse condo.

She “outmaneuvered Trump [and] was the tactician behind the investigation that resulted in Trump’s impeachment.”

Genius.

Pelosi is rather like the fanatical Christian missionary John le Carre described in “The Honorary Schoolboy”: “She could spot a sin before it was committed.”

It might work in religion, but in politics you get found out.

And found out Pelosi has been, saved from embarrassment only by a supine media.

There’s nothing wrong with admiring Pelosi as a female standard-bearer, but she must be held to account for her mistakes, and when it comes to Trump, she has lost her mind.

“Crazy Nancy” the president called her in a tweet Sunday, and he’s not far wrong.

Take Iowa.

The impeachment trial is not expected to start before next Tuesday. So the five Democrat senators running for president — Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker and Michael Bennett — will be stuck in Washington six days a week at the exact time when they’re supposed to be pressing the flesh in the first-caucus state.

Booker described the timing as a “big, big blow.”

With Sanders the front-runner in Iowa, that gives Joe Biden an unfair advantage, which a lot of Bernie Bros suspect is the real reason for delaying impeachment.

But if assisting Biden’s campaign was Pelosi’s motive, it’s another fatally flawed strategy. A candidate who needs witness protection to save him from his own gaffes and unsavory history will be eaten alive by Trump if he is the nominee.

Sanders, the most Trumpian of Democrats, may yet prevail, despite Pelosi’s roadblocks.

But when the history of the 2020 election is written, we will see that the electoral well-being of the Democrats was no more Pelosi’s priority than was the national interest.

Impeachment was her compromise to save her job and preserve the party establishment against the Michael Bloomberg-funded insurgency of younger left-wing women led by Sanders’ pal, Ocasio-Cortez.

“Many of them were out there for impeachment like a year ago,” Pelosi tells Time.

The pressure mounted in late 2018 when AOC joined a climate change sit-in at Pelosi’s office and called her a “racist.”

Then, at a banquet in San Francisco last August, Pelosi was shouted down by young activists standing on chairs and unfurling banners: “TIME TO IMPEACH.” and “WE CAN’T WAIT.”

A few weeks later came the wafer-thin pretext of Trump’s Ukraine phone call.

For a party facing an existential crisis, impeachment has united Democrats around a mutual loathing of Trump, no matter how destructive the obsession is to their electoral hopes.

There is no lofty principle in Pelosi’s behavior, no clever tactical calculation, just dumb self-interest.

Rudy and Bratton’s wisdom on bail reform

When the two men most responsible for cleaning up New York’s previous crime wave tell you the city is on track for disaster, you better listen.

First, former Mayor Rudy Guiiuliani sounded the alarm, and now legendary former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton has slammed the criminal-justice reforms whichthat have tied the hands of judges and endangered New Yorkers.

“This isn’t reform,” he told radio host John Catsimatidis yesterday.

“This is total capitulation to the criminal defense lawyers, The Legal Aid sSociety, and some of our progressive legislators.”

Who does it help to release without bail s a violent homeless drug addict charged with assaulting three Manhattan women at random, as happened over the weekend? It’s no good for him to get more wasted and disturbed on the streets. Jail would be a mercy for everyone.

Royal ‘racism’ idiocy

Megan Markle and Prince Harry are spoiled brats, but the woke media is establishing a narrative that absolves them.

We are supposed to believe that the beautiful B-grade actress who snared a British prince just 20 months ago is a victim of racism.

But no one buys it. If they were racist, the queen and the British public would never have embraced Markle as they did and lavished millions on her wedding and lifestyle.

It’s not racism that forced Meghan and Harry to become celebrity grifters, enjoying the perks of royalty without the responsibilities. It’s selfishness.

Now we hear that if they don’t get what they want, they will spill the beans about the royals in a TV interview. That probably means accusations of racism, which will do enormous damage to the monarchy and will boomerang back to hurt Harry and their son.
