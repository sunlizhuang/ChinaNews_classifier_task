HANOI/SYDNEY: The Vietnamese carrier Vietjet will suspend all flights to and from China from Saturday over coronavirus concerns, the company said on Friday.

"Vietjet has already planned to suspend all of its flights to China," it said in a statement. "The suspension is effective from February 1."

On Thursday, Vietnam said it would stop issuing visas for Chinese tourists after the Southeast Asian country detected three new cases of the virus.

Singapore Airlines said it would reduce capacity on some of its routes to mainland China in February due to the growing scale of the coronavirus epidemic.

The cuts include flights to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Xiamen and Chongqing, some of which are flown by regional arm SilkAir, it said on its Facebook page.

Singapore Airlines' low-cost carrier Scoot said it would be suspending flights to 11 cities in China from early February until the end of March and it would reduce frequencies to eight other Chinese destinations.
