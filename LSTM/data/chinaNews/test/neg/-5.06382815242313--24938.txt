Citing rising concern about the coronavirus outbreak in China, organizers called off the annual Live In Langley Lunar New Year celebration early on Saturday, Jan. 25, just hours before the celebration of Chinese art and culture was scheduled to take place.

Organizing committee member Susan Yu said the decision was made after about 200 people, some of them performers, cancelled.

“It’s just so sad, but we do believe it is the smart thing to do,” Yu told the Langley Advance Times.

“A lot of people travel to and from China this time of year,” she explained.

“It [the outbreak] is just getting worse and worse.”

In addition to the online cancellation notification, a small group of volunteers were going to be at the event location, Langley Christian Life Assembly, to inform ticket holders of the decision.

Yu said tickets will be refunded.

This year, attendance was expected to total nearly 1,000, a record for the all-volunteer event held by Live In Langley Chinese Association.

Yu added organizers are looking at holding the celebration later on this year, possibly “mid-autumn,” when it is hoped the virus risk will have been eliminated.

Yu added the organizers “definitely” intend to hold a new year celebration next year.
