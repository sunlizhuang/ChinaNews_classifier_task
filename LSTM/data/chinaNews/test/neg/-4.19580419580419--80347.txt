Health officials in Arizona say a patient with coronavirus is continuing to recover under a home quarantine.

The person, who is under 60 and has ties to Arizona State University in Tempe, remained in stable condition Wednesday, according to Sonia Singh, of Maricopa County Public Health.

People who have had close contact with the patient have not shown any signs to date of the illness known as COVID-19. Singh said most of them have passed the 14-day monitoring period without displaying any symptoms.

The Arizona case was first reported Jan. 26. Health officials said the person does not live in university housing and has been in isolation since returning from Wuhan, the central Chinese city thatâ€™s the epicenter of the epidemic.

The virus has sickened more than 74,000 in China and hundreds worldwide. More than 2,000 people have died. All but five of the deaths occurred in mainland China. In the U.S., there are 15 confirmed cases.
