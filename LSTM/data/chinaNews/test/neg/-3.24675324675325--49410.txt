Michael Beckerman

Internet Association CEO Michael Beckerman is leaving his post at the trade group to join TikTok social media platform on Feb. 29.

He’ll be VP in charge of US public policy, a TikTok spokesperson told O’Dwyer’s.

US lawmakers believe TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, poses a threat to its national security.

Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Tom Cotton (R-AR) fear that TikTok may be used by China’s government, as a tool of espionage and for spreading propaganda among millions of Americans.

ByteDance spent $270K in lobbying during the second-half of 2019 on issues related to Internet technology and learning-enable content platforms.

Beckerman has served as IA CEO since its founding in 2012. General counsel Jon Berroya will slide into the interim president/CEO slot on March 1.

Google, Facebook, Amazon, eBay, Microsoft, Twitter and Uber are among IA members.
