UPDATE: 9:35 a.m.

A plane carrying Canadian citizens home from the centre of the global novel coronavirus outbreak has landed in Vancouver.

The evacuation flight organized by the federal government departed from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak originated.

The plane was originally due to take off on Wednesday, but was delayed due to bad weather.

Several dozen more Canadian passengers left China on board a United States government flight that departed a few hours later.

All evacuees from Wuhan will spend 14 days under quarantine at Canadian Forces Base Trenton, where they will be monitored to see if they have contracted the virus.

Canadian officials have documented five cases of coronavirus in the country so far and say the quarantine is necessary to ensure the virus doesn't spread further.

A charter plane carrying Canadian citizens home from the centre of the global novel coronavirus outbreak has begun its journey home.

The evacuation flight organized by the federal government has departed from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak originated.

The plane was originally due to take off on Wednesday, but was delayed due to bad weather.

About 50 more Canadian passengers are expected to leave China on board a United States government flight scheduled to depart in a few hours.

All evacuees from Wuhan will spend 14 days under quarantine at Canadian Forces Base Trenton, where they will be monitored to see if they have contracted the virus.

UPDATE: 10:20 a.m.

The federal government has chartered a second flight to bring Canadians home from the centre of the new coronavirus outbreak next week.

Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne says that second flight is scheduled to leave Wuhan on Feb. 10 and arrive in Canada the next day.

People have already begun boarding the first flight that will soon take some Canadians out of Wuhan, a city under quarantine in central China.

Champagne says some of the 211 people who were on the passenger list for that flight, which had been delayed, did not show up.

That flight is expected to land early Friday at Canadian Forces Base Trenton, where passengers will remain under quarantine for 14 days.

There are also a few dozen seats for Canadians on a U.S. plane set to leave Wuhan a few hours after the initial flight chartered by the Canadian government.

UPDATE: 9:20 a.m.

Hundreds of people in Wuhan have begun boarding the flight that will take them out of the centre of the new coronavirus outbreak and back to their families and friends in Canada.

Myriam Larouche, a 25-year-old student from Quebec who is in Wuhan, said the flight began to board just past midnight Friday local time.

More than 300 people have asked for Ottawa's help getting out of the city, but Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne has said there are 211 passengers expected on the flight.

An update from the government is expected later Thursday.

Kate Schellenberg said she received a text message from her twin brother Michael as he was waiting to board. He is set to leave China with his wife Summer Wu and their one-year-old son Felix.

He told her that he could see the plane, and people wearing yellow hazmat suits.

Global Affairs Canada advised passengers to expect delays, noting that Chinese authorities would be performing health screening and immigration controls before people were allowed to board.

"The check-in experience will be significantly different to what you may be used to," said an email, obtained by The Canadian Press. "We ask for your understanding and patience."

Those who aren't able to get to the airport or who have decided not to make the trip are asked to contact consular officials.

Upon their arrival in Canada, evacuees will be quarantined at Canadian Forces Base Trenton in southern Ontario for two weeks.

Canadian evacuees from Wuhan have been told they will soon board the flight that will bring them home.
