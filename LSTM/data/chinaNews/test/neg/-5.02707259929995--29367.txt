A guy from the U.S bought masks online to protect him self against the coronavirus. All was well until he saw that the masks came from Wuhan.



How is this virus going effect global trade?

I see the "Wuhan Coronavirus" thread has disapppered.Probably pretty badly. The cornovirus is a hoax perpetrated by the CCP. It exists, but is not particularly debilitating to most healthy adults. Their growth rates for the virus are fudged. The growth of living organisms follow an exponential function, not a logistic one. The virus most likely came from their Bio-Level 4 lab in Wuhan; not some Chinaman eating bats, or fish, or snakes. When my pet turtle catches rabbis I'll let you know. Its purpose is to put Chinese troops in Hong Kong. More areas will come under marshal law (or what ever they call it in China) they will be quarantined and travel will be restricted. Hong Kong will soon be included with the 7 other cities they have declared as disaster areas. They have a garrison waiting on the border, a few miles from the center of the city.Mainland China's take over of Hong Kong, some 20 years early, is going to have serious repercussions. 60% of China's US currency flows through it under the States special trading status. Hong Kong is China's Western bank account. Since HK is still a British protectorate, until it legally returns to China, the Brits may not take this well. The US will of course back them up. If China is truly serious about dumping the dollar, she is doing it now.This is likely to mess up Wall Streets euphoric attitude. The FED's wizard machine can't bail them out of this one.
