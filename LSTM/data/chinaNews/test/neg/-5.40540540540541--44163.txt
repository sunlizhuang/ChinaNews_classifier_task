The hospitals in the quarantined cities in China are turning away patients with Coronavirus symptoms. This has led the country to build a new hospital just to deal with the outbreak of the virus.

Chinese authorities sa y the hospital will have 1,000 beds intended for patients that have coronavirus symptoms. They also said that they will finish the hospital in just six days.

The drastic construction of the hospital is the result of the unraveling situation in Wuhan City. A city which has been locked down to control the spread of the virus. Many hospitals in the quarantined city are running out of beds and medical supplies. As a result, patients who have coronavirus symptoms are no longer being accepted in the city's hospitals. The situation in the city is becoming worse due to a slow response from authorities in Wuhan and Beijing.

As of the latest numbers, Coronavirus has killed 26 people and has infected more than 830 worldwide. The Chinese state media reported that the hospital worked immediately last Thursday to quarantine the infected persons in the Caidian district of Wuhan. Officials, and those who are working to build the hospitals, gave assurance that the hospital will be available and ready to use by the middle of next week.

Still, many are questioning if the hospital can actually be built, and more so, functional, in just six days. However, it can be recalled that during the SARS outbreak in 2003, China was able to build a 1,000-bed Xiaotangshan hospital in just a week with a workforce of around 7,000 people.

At present, The South China Morning Post reported that there are hundreds of workers who began working on the site. They worked along side locals and are paid three times their normal rate of $173 per day.

The plans for the building are still being finalized, but it is expected to be delivered on Friday to the general contractor company. Moreover, while waiting for the final plan, there are many images and video footage showing dozens of diggers, bulldozers, and trucks that are posted all across social media. The heavy equipment is working feverishly to clear the site.

Meanwhile, residents in Wuhan are expressing their frustration and anger on social media despite the effort of the government to build a hospital in just six days. State-run media is urging the citizens to stay calm.

There was footage posted on social media showing the present situation of patients in Wuhan. Patients lying in hospital hallways, doctors screaming at patients, and long queues of Chinese individuals lining up and waiting to be seen and checked by a doctor.

However, residents say that many hospitals turned them away and they were told that there were no available test kits for the virus. In the posts of Wuhan Children's Hospital, they wrote in their social media account "Shortage of medical supplies, request help!" on Thursday. Other hospitals also did the same while at the same time requested for surgical masks, disposable garments, protective goggles, and gloves.

The situation in Wuhan has put the Chinese government under pressure in controlling the spread of the infectious virus. The report of the virus was reported in mid-December and Beijing was criticized for their delayed action.

The plan of the Chinese government right now is to lock down entire cities infected by the virus, most especially Wuhan. In the past few days, the Chinese government has imposed severe travel restrictions in nine cities on the central province of Hubei, a decision that has impacted an estimated 30 million people.
