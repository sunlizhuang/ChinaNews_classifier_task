Shanghai in the wake of the widespread outbreak of coronavirus (Molly Holt)

Dramatic images show how Shanghai - one of the biggest cities in the world - is now a “ghost town” amid the outbreak of coronavirus.

Brit Molly Holt today told Yahoo News UK how she started her east Asian travelling holiday in the Chinese city three weeks ago, before the widespread outbreak of the deadly disease.

Ms Holt returned to Shanghai for the final week of her holiday, only to find the city’s famous hustle and bustle has completely disappeared.

Meanwhile, “everywhere smells like disinfectant,” she said.

As of Sunday, coronavirus had claimed 81 lives in China after it spread from Wuhan. There are nearly 3,000 confirmed cases worldwide with nearly 6,000 suspected cases.

It prompted the Shanghai government to stop a majority of businesses operating until February 10.

Ahead of her flight home, Ms Holt said: “We started off in Shanghai, moving to Tokyo and Hong Kong [where a city-wide emergency has now been declared], before returning to Shanghai for the last week. Everywhere we went, the virus travelled with us.
