Taipei, Jan. 31 (CNA) Another case of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was confirmed in Taiwan on Friday, bringing the number of cases in the country to 10, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said.

The latest victim is a man who had returned from the Chinese city of Wuhan on Jan. 12 and developed respiratory symptoms on Jan. 22. He subsequently infected his wife, who was confirmed by the CECC on Thursday as having contracted the 2019-nCoV virus.

The symptoms the husband had were too mild to qualify as a suspected 2019-nCoV case when he initially sought medical treatment at a local hospital, according to Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the epidemic response center.

Further tests revealed Friday, however, that the husband was indeed infected with the Wuhan coronavirus, Chen told reporters at a press briefing in Taipei. [FULL STORY]
