Key Highlights 'At the moment I do not know enough about it'

'I will speak to the Chinese privately about it as that's the way they like it'

China has continuously defended its horrific treatment of the Uighur Muslims, Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities as an effort to curb Islamic terrorism

Davos: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has no idea about what is happening in China’s Xinjiang region. Talking to a journalist on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum PM Khan raked up Kashmir issue instead when asked about the incarceration of thousands of Muslims in China’s restive Xinjiang province.

At the moment I do not know enough about it and if I have I will speak to the Chinese privately about it as that's the way they like it, said Khan.

Despite overwhelming evidence of systematic suppression of Uighur Muslims in China, Imran Khan’s deafening silence over the issue shows the hold Beijing has on its debt-ridden "Iron Brother".

The United States has already warned Pakistan that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) would push the country deeper into debt burden. However, Beijing has refuted the US assertions claiming that the debt incurred from the project stands at USD 4.9 billion, which is less than one-tenth of Pakistan's total debt.

On the other hand, former Chief Economist of Pakistan Government, Dr. Nadeem Javaid, had said that CPEC debt payments will peak to USD 5 billion in 2022.

China has continuously defended its horrific treatment of the Uighur Muslims, Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities as an effort to curb Islamic terrorism claiming that the internment camps are vocational skill retraining centres.

Last year in November, a stunning November 16 feature article titled 'The Xinjiang Papers was published by the New York Times based upon 400-plus pages of leaked documents that disclosed the abhorrent truth about China's internment camps.

Many Uighurs face detention over trumped-up or flimsy charges such as texting people outside Xinjiang or setting clocks to two hours ahead of Beijing's time zone to align with Xinjiang's natural daylight schedule, reported IANS.

However, many relatives of detained Uighurs in Xinjiang say their relatives are professionals – such as doctors and editors – and do not require vocational training.
