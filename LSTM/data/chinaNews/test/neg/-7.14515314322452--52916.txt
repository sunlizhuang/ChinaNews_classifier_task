STAMFORD, CT â€” Police are investigating a burglary that occurred at a Chinese restaurant in Stamford over the weekend. Sgt. Sean Scanlan said the owner of First Wok on Glenbrook Road told police he locked up the restaurant and went home around 11:15 p.m. on Saturday.

When the owner returned about 12 hours later on Sunday, he noticed the cash register was open and $100 was missing, Scanlan said. After further investigation, the owner realized the front door had also been pried open.

According to Scanlan, there was "not much damage" to the door and only the $100 was taken. He also said officers will be following up, checking for video footage and fingerprints.
