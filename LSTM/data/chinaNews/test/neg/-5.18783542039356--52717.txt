MONTGOMERY — The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) is asking anyone traveling to mainland China, on or after Jan. 22, 2020, to contact the Infectious Diseases and Outbreaks Division. Mainland China does not include Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has set interim exposure risk categories and movement restrictions for those who may have been exposed to the novel coronavirus. The categories are listed below. The ADPH will set requirements for travelers based on those categories.

At this time, no cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Alabama.

The number to call is 1 (800) 338-8374. The ADPH would like travelers to call as soon as they arrive in Alabama.

CDC CATEGORIES

High Risk (Stay at home. No public activities. Daily active monitoring by ID&O staff for 14 days after last exposure.)

· Travel from Hubei Province, China.

· Living in the same household as, being an intimate partner of, or providing care in a nonhealthcare setting (such as a home) for a person with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection without using recommended precautions for home care and home isolation.

· The same risk assessment applies for the above-listed exposures to a person diagnosed clinically with 2019-nCoV infection outside of the United States who did not have laboratory testing.

Medium Risk (Remain home. Avoid congregate settings including but not limited to classrooms, shared offices, churches, public transportation, and remain out of public places where close contact with others may occur. Daily active monitoring by ID&O for 14 days after last exposure.)

· Travel from mainland China outside Hubei Province

· Close contact with a person with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, and not having any exposures that meet a high-risk definition.
