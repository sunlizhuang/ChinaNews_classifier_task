An American couple was planning to finally pick up their adopted daughter in China this weekend. Now, the process is on hold due to novel coronavirus.

After two years of paperwork, Ivy and Noah Cleveland had a room, a crib and clothes ready to welcome 3-year-old Ruby into their Georgia home. But their adoption agency canceled the trip that would have finalized Ruby’s adoption.

“This was the first time in my life that I truly wept to the point of being sick in my body,” Ivy Cleveland told CNN. "I just laid over her bed, over her crib that I had prepared for her and look up at the pictures in the wall, and her clothes in her closet, understanding that this is not happening right now.”

Last month, the State Department issued the highest-level warning not to travel to China due to the coronavirus outbreak and recommended that US citizens defer travel for adoption purposes.

“We strongly recommend that U.S. citizens defer travel to China for adoption purposes and that prospective adoptive parents contact their adoption service providers to discuss future plans,” the department said on January 31.

The Clevelands are unsure when they will able travel to China, but said they are not ready to give up their adoption process.

“I know this is just a part of our story, it’s part of Ruby’s story and how incredible will it be to tell her ‘look what we did to fight for you,’” Noah Cleveland said.
