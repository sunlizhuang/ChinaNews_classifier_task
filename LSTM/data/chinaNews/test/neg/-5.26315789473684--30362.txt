On Monday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called on US citizens to "avoid all nonessential travel to all of" China.

On Sunday, China's Health Minister, Ma Xiaowei, warned that infected individuals are contagious before they begin to show symptoms of the disease.

The new coronavirus has been linked to rats and live wolf pups in the food market in Wuhan, China, where the virus is believed to have originated. Last week, China closed Wuhan to travel, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.

At first, it was believed that the novel coronavirus (2019 n-COV) was not transmissible between humans, and was limited to animal-human contact. However, authorities soon began seeing cases of people who had not traveled to Wuhan but had become infected by family members who had recently returned from traveling there.
