The US State Department and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention have issued travel notices for countries affected by the novel coronavirus.

As of Monday, the coronavirus has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 89,000. The vast majority of cases and deaths are in China, but the virus has spread to 69 other countries.

The CDC has issued its most severe threat-level warning for China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran, strongly recommending that US citizens avoid travelling to those countries.

The US State Department and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention have issued a series of travel warnings for Americans because of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.

Cases have been reported in at least 58 countries, though about 92% are in China. Vice President Mike Pence announced new travel restrictions after the first coronavirus death on US soil was confirmed Saturday. The change tightens recommendations for Americans looking to travel to Italy and South Korea.

The CDC’s guidelines range from Level 1: Practice usual precautions to Level 3: Avoid all nonessential travel.

The current CDC warnings are:

Here are travel precautions and guidelines the US government has issued for countries affected by the coronavirus.

Cases of the coronavirus have been reported in at least 70 countries, with the majority in China.

If travelling to any areas where disease transmission is present, the CDC recommends that Americans:

Avoid sick people

Try not to touch your eyes, nose, or mouth without washing your hands

Wash your hands often

The CDC cautions that any travellers returning from one of those six places who come down with a fever, cough, or shortness of breath should immediately seek medical help, call ahead before going to the doctor, avoid contact with others, and exercise increased sanitation.

The US State Department uses four levels of travel-warning guidance, from Level 1: Exercise normal precautions to Level 4: Do not travel. The agency has issued the following warnings related to coronavirus:

In some cases, the US embassies in these places have issued further guidance. You can check for that on the State Department’s website.

The CDC “recommends that all travellers reconsider cruise ship voyages to or within Asia.”

The CDC issued its highest health notice for mainland China (Level 3: Avoid nonessential travel).

Because of widespread transmission of the coronavirus in China, the CDC and State Department recommend that travellers avoid all travel to the country.

The US State Department encourages any Americans in China to depart the country by commercial means and recommends that US citizens remaining in China spend as much time as possible at home and away from public gatherings.

At least 73 airlines have cancelled flights to China amid coronavirus fears, and the US government evacuated some US citizens from the country.

The White House has barred foreign nationals who have been to China in the past 14 days from entering the US, is quarantining Americans who recently travelled to China’s Hubei province, and is asking Americans who visited other parts of China to “self-quarantine.”

The CDC warns that older adults and people with chronic medical conditions have an increased risk of the disease. Furthermore, the agency has outlined that those arriving in the US from China will undergo health screenings and that travellers who have been to China within the past 14 days must enter through specific airports and participate in monitoring by health officials until 14 days after they left China.

China has reported more than 80,000 cases and at least 2,900 deaths from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

The CDC also issued its highest health notice for South Korea (Level 3: Avoid nonessential travel).

The CDC recommends Americans avoid travelling to South Korea, which has seen a particularly high transmission of the coronavirus. It warned that older adults and those with chronic medical conditions could be at risk of severe symptoms from the virus.

The State Department also warned: “If suspected to have coronavirus in South Korea, you may face travel delays, quarantine, and extremely expensive medical costs.”

Vice President Mike Pence announced on Saturday that authorities were issuing a level four advisory, warning Americans against travelling to specific areas of South Korea. He also said the State Department is developing medical screening guidelines for people returning to the US.

By Monday, South Korea had reported 4,335 cases and 26 deaths from the coronavirus.

Italy has put a dozen towns on lockdown to contain the coronavirus spread. The CDC issued its highest health notice for the country (Level 3: Avoid nonessential travel).

Associated Press Italian Army soldiers and police check transit to and from the cordoned areas near Turano Lodigiano, Northern Italy, Tuesday, Feb. 25, 2020.

Italy has reported more than 1,694 infections and 34 deaths as of Monday. The CDC listed the country as a Level 3 threat, and recommended Americans avoid non-essential travel.

Pence announced on February 29 that authorities were issuing a level-4 advisory warning Americans against travelling to specific areas of Italy.

The State Department lists Italy as its second-highest warning (Level 3: Reconsider travel) because of the coronavirus.

The two most infected areas in Italy are the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, which contain the major cities of Milan and Venice. The State Department lists those towns at its highest advisory (Level 4: Do not travel). The virus has also spread in the south, with Tuscany and the island of Sicily also reporting cases.

Pence also announced Saturday that the administration is “expanding existing travel restrictions to include any foreign national who has visited Iran within the last 14 days.” The CDC issued its highest health notice for Iran (Level 3: Avoid nonessential travel).

The number of coronavirus cases in Iran has surged recently; the CDC increased its threat level because the country “is experiencing sustained community spread.”

The agency recommends Americans avoid all non-essential travel to Iran.

The State Department also gives Iran a Level 4 warning because of what it says is a high risk of kidnapping, arrest, and detention of US citizens.

The US government does not have formal diplomatic relations with Iran and says it is therefore unable to provide emergency services to US citizens, so strongly recommends avoiding travel to the country.

By Monday, Iran had reported 978 cases and 54 deaths from the coronavirus.

The CDC issued its next-highest level for Japan (Level 2: Practice enhanced precautions).

The CDC and the US State Department warn that Japan is experiencing an increase in transmission of the coronavirus and recommend that older adults and people with chronic medical conditions should consider postponing nonessential travel.

By Monday, Japan had reported at least 256 cases and four deaths from the disease.

The CDC issued its lowest threat for Hong Kong (Level 1: Practice usual precautions).

The CDC does not suggest travellers cancel or postpone trips to Hong Kong at this time, listing it as its lowest “watch” level because there is limited community transmission.

The agency explained: “Community spread means that people in Hong Kong have been infected with the virus, but how or where they became infected is not known.”

The US State Department reported in early February that the Hong Kong government began enforcing a 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in Hong Kong who had visited mainland China within the previous two weeks. The agency recommends exercising increased caution because of the coronavirus.

By Monday, Hong Kong had reported 98 cases and two deaths from the disease.

The CDC warned last week that Americans should brace for the rapid spread of the virus.

The first two coronavirus deaths on US soil were reported over the weekend. The CDC warned that the spread of the disease in the US could increase quickly and that Americans should be prepared. As of Monday, the coronavirus has infected 86 people in the US.

The Trump administration sent a request to Congress for $US2.5 billion to be allocated to coronavirus relief, including funds for vaccine development, protective equipment, and other response measures.

So far, cases have been reported in the following states:

Arizona

California

Florida

Illinois

Massachusetts

New York

Oregon

Rhode Island

Texas

Washington
