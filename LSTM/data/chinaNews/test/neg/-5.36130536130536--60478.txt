SCREENSHOT via SCREENSHOT via Keith Zhai, @QiZHAI : ‘China whistleblower doc #LiWenliang ‘s favorite food vlogger did a special show for Mr. Li, and netizens photoshopped Li’s photo on it.’

• Online tributes and expressions of grief for doctor who tried to sound alarm on NCoV

Online in China, where Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has now killed at least 630 as of today, one death seems to have affected the entire country profoundly.

Li Wenliang was a medical doctor and a whistleblower who was reprimanded by authorities for warning of a fast-escalating and deadly outbreak of a strange new virus.

He died yesterday, of the virus he warned others about.

Hundreds have died, and yet this is the fatality that is shaking China. https://t.co/5gMrjoTCTg — Carlos Tejada (@CRTejada) February 7, 2020

The tributes and memorials are -- wow. Wow. Wow.

This one, below? the person in the snow?

It says “Farewell Li Wenliang.”

Their body forms an exclamation point.

Here are a few more, from China-based photojournalists, reporters, and others.

Can’t confirm, but this is supposed to be the salute given to Li Wenliang tonight in Wuhan. If it’s real, it’s incredible. The physical version of what’s been happening on the Chinese Internet for the past 24 hours. https://t.co/I68qdqUtgs — Paul Mozur 孟建国 (@paulmozur) February 7, 2020

In Hong Kong too, people are paying their respects and mourning the death of Dr Li Wenliang, who tried to alert China to the coronavirus but was reprimanded for it. He died yesterday of this new type of pneumonia https://t.co/ciFW2ABMk4 — Ilaria Maria Sala (@IlariaMariaSala) February 7, 2020

I was full of hope. I thought we didn’t let this man freeze in the snowstorm, I found him and helped introduced him to the world. I told Dr. Li good men will be rewarded 好人会有好报. He was shy when I asked him to send me a selfie. He said he hadn’t washed his hair for a while. https://t.co/Es5OargqjA — Elsie Chen (@elsiechenyi) February 7, 2020

"The hashtag #wewantfreedomofspeech# was created on Weibo at 2 a.m. on Friday...and had over two million views and over 5,500 posts by 7 a.m. It was deleted by censors, along with related topics, such as ones saying the Wuhan govt owed Dr. Li an apology." https://t.co/sDaVBqMr46 — Julian Ku 古舉倫 (@julianku) February 7, 2020

A photo from Caixin reporter Ding Gang of Wuhan doctors paying respects to Li Wenliang. 100% of my WeChat feed, from dissident lawyers to Huawei employees, is raging over Li’s death. Haven’t seen China unified like this since the Wenzhou train crash. pic.twitter.com/lJQE1XMJBQ — Josh Chin (@joshchin) February 7, 2020

Can't be emphasized enough how unusual this is. 12 hours on, WeChat still seething. Quoting "we know they're lying, they know they're lying". Sharing "Do you hear the people sing?" (HK protest anthem). Realists say nothing will change. Probably not. But a crack has opened. pic.twitter.com/OJRQOw95qu — Simon Rabinovitch (@S_Rabinovitch) February 7, 2020

Looking at this and thinking of @EmilyZFeng’s interviewer saying the new hospitals are places where they send you to die. No facilities visible, no drips visible, no medical workers visible. https://t.co/t7BgSDV5P2 — Louisa Lim (@limlouisa) February 7, 2020

As everyday Chinese in mainland China remember #ChinaVirus #Whistleblower Dr. #LiWenliang #李文亮, remember also another who dared #speaktruthtopower & a poem, from after the death of Liu Xiaobo "You want to bury him / bury into the dirt / but you forget / he is a seed" pic.twitter.com/pnGkHxgndI — 🚶🏻Curtis S.

The Chinese public have staged what amounts to an online revolt last night after the death of Dr. Li Wenliang.Government officials,biz figures & ordinary folks,have posted numerous messages expressing their grief and anger. It's sth I haven't seen in years https://t.co/zge4rVysB2 pic.twitter.com/uL4JVd89u1 — Li Yuan (@LiYuan6) February 7, 2020
