At a time where families in China should be celebrating the Chinese New Year, residents and officials are facing something far more serious. The death count following a viral disease in China has risen to an alarming 106. The outbreak is known as the Coronavirus. As of Tuesday, the United States officials have authorized their citizens to immediately evacuate China, following lockdown of the city.

The virus has spread in cities of China including, Beijing, Hubei, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and Wuhan. The outbreak is similar to the Sars virus, a virus that killed nearly 774 people in the early 2000s across dozens of cities in Asia. The coronavirus causes its victims to suffer from a type of pneumonia, officials confirmed that it can pass from person to person. Respiratory expert, Zhong Nanshan reported that 14 medical workers had caught the virus from treating patients.

Doctors say the symptoms to the virus are similar to any other “upper respiratory” infection. Which includes a runny nose, sore throat, coughing, and even a fever. China’s hospital staff has released a video to give viewers an inside look at what they are facing. “I have been working all day long. The infection is much more horrible than what is reported on TV. There are so many cases. Doctors have estimated about 100,000 infected. We have more than ten doctors here. Each doctor has treated more than 100 infected people in just one day.” In the video the woman continues to explain the lack of government aid, reporting that there aren’t enough supplies to help all of the patients.

Wuhan authorities say they are working fast to construct a new hospital by February 3rd, to deal with the crisis. Almost 450 military medical staff have been deployed to Hubei to help treat the outbreak. Officials have closed access to highways in the cities and have canceled many celebrations that were scheduled to celebrate the New Year.
