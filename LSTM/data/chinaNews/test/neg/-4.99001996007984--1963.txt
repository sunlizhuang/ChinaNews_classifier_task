Authorities are conducting an 'open and active criminal investigation' at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort following an unspecified incident on Monday night.

The Secret Service is leading the investigation with help from the Palm Beach Police Department.

No arrests have been made and officials have declined to discuss the nature of the incident.

Palm Beach police released a nearly entirely redacted incident report which indicated that officers were called to the resort in southern Florida at around 7pm Monday to 'assist' another law enforcement agency.

Trump and his family were not at Mar-a-Lago at the time, having left for Washington, DC, the previous day after spending the holidays there.

The incident comes as Mar-a-Lago is on heightened alert after Trump ordered a military strike that killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani last Friday. The president was at the resort when he made the order.

An adviser to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani tweeted a Forbes list of Trump's properties, including Mar-a-Lago, on Sunday. In a successive tweet he wrote: 'We have ZERO problems with the American people ... Our sole problem is Trump. In the event of war, it is he who will bear full responsibility.'

Mar-a-Lago has seen several security breaches since Trump became president.

A Chinese woman, Lu Jing, was arrested for trespassing at the property last month after investigators said she snuck in to take photos.

Another Chinese woman, Yujing Zhang, was arrested for trespassing in March, sparking a federal investigation into whether she was a potential foreign agent.

Zhang was convicted of entering a restricted federal area and making false statements.

In response to the breaches, the Secret Service reportedly added two new security checkpoints to screen members and guests entering the private club when Trump is there.
