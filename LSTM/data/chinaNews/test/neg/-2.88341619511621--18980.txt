Over the past 5 years Alberta has experienced economic challenges. Under Trudeau Canadian investment abroad is on the rise while direct foreign investment in Canada is declining. This disconcerting trend may extend the downturn in the economy beyond Alberta to other jurisdictions in our country having a lasting effect.

It will not be easy to stop and reverse the trend in capital divesture. A shift in federal policy direction as well as a coordinated lobbying effort between business, governments, and associations will be required to convince stakeholders Canada is a viable location for investment. The job is made more difficult when our Prime Minister continually diminishes Canada’s reputation on the world stage.

The Canadian Government’s reputation has been tarnished over the last few years. We have fallen from the world’s best administration to 6th on global rankings. Besides adopting policy change that deters investment and decreases returns, Trudeau’s blunders on the international stage have damaged Canada’s image. Our Prime Minister is now renowned for his propensity to dress up. One only need remember the trip to India where he was ridiculed for wearing Bollywood style garb that offended locals and officials.

Our Prime Minister has become a mainstay on comedy networks for insults he directed at the US President, his infamous water bottle comments and the decade-long schtick he adopted of dressing in “blackface”. It is difficult for Canadian and provincial representatives to have serious and meaningful conversations with foreign dignitaries and investment firms wishing to do business with our country when our leader is a target of ridicule.

Worldwide, Canada is generally known as a peacekeeper, but lately our country has been criticized for sympathizing with terrorists and not providing sufficient resources to NATO. It is difficult to defend a Prime Minister who has dined with an extremist convicted of attempting to murder an Indian political official and who lent a sympathetic ear to Joshua Boyle in Ottawa. But these actions pale in comparison to the Trudeau Government’s payment of $10.5M, without a court order, to convicted terrorist Omar Khadr. This secret deal stunned the international community and Canadians alike.

Our Prime Minister continues to rack up a track record of poor judgement by praising Fidel Castro and voicing his admiration for the communist dictatorship in China.

Last November Trudeau supported a UN resolution co-sponsored by North Korea, Zimbabwe and the PLO calling for an end of Israeli occupation and asking all states to support Palestine. The resolution was previously opposed by the Harper Government as well as Israel and the United States. Canada refusing to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and supporting a UN resolution co-sponsored by countries with such atrocious human rights and terrorist records is questionable at best and damages our international influence and standing. Canadians should be greatly concerned when their leadership takes a stand against the only democracy in that region.

From a financial perspective, Canada’s judgement is also being questioned. The federal government is creating policy to drive investment out of the country, while our Prime Minister does little to inspire investor confidence. Trudeau shows little remorse for his involvement in the criminal case of SNC-Lavalin, a company recently found guilty and fined $280M for engaging in fraud and bribery with the Gadhafi family in Libya. He has yet to apologize for his actions even though the company itself has done so. These missteps make Canada look complicit and corrupt and may have a long-term impact on our ability to complete trade deals and attract investment.

Premier Jason Kenney, as Minister of Immigration, Employment and National Defense in Ottawa, developed a reputation as a hard-working, honorable and dedicated statesman. He continues to demonstrate these strengths as Premier, focusing on bringing capital back to our province and emphasizing the positive attributes of not only Alberta, but Canada as a whole.

The Premier and his Ministers are traveling abroad trying to attract new business to Alberta, but foreign investors see our province in the context of a larger Canada. For this reason, the actions of Mr. Trudeau become a hurdle that must be overcome in order to secure investment. I can attest, as someone with a background in sales, that success in signing large contracts takes time and is difficult under ideal conditions. This task is made monumentally more difficult when the shortfalls of our Prime Minister and his government become the focus of potential investors.

Eastern Canada has reelected Justin Trudeau despite his glaring errors in judgement. I hope our country does not suffer a major economic downturn, but Canada’s policy direction and weakening international reputation is concerning. Our UCP government’s chance for success would improve if we could get cooperation from Ottawa. Hopefully the Liberals will work to repair their relationship with our beleaguered province as well as the international community in the months ahead.
