The Chinese embassy in Paris has made contact with the woman who bragged about eating at a Michelin star restaurant despite having a fever and coughing before landing in the city.

Officials were able to contact the woman on Wednesday evening and asked her to refer herself to medical services, according to BBC.

The Chinese embassy said in a statement that the woman’s temperature was under control and that she was not showing symptoms,such as a cough or fever, adding that “further examinations” are not required at this time.

The woman, who came from the city of Wuhan, in the Hubei province, China where the virus originated, reportedly bragged about having a fever before arriving in France. She was able to get past the medical screening by drinking antipyretic medicine to lower her temperature.

She also left Wuhan before officials raised a travel ban on the city.

“Finally I can have a good meal, I feel like I’ve been starving for two days. When you are in a gourmet city of course you have to eat Michelin [food],” she posted on WeChat.

“Just before I left, I had a low fever and cough. I was scared to death and rushed to eat [fever-reducing] medicine. I kept on checking my temperature. Luckily I managed to get it down and my exit was smooth.”

The woman shared pictures of her trip to an unknown Michelin star restaurant in Lyon, France. However, it’s unclear when she arrived in the city.

Her post shortly went viral and many social media users criticized her for her actions. One user called her a “ticking time bomb,” while another criticized her for being “the most shameless person.”
