All flights to China have been suspended by British Airways because of coronavirus.

The flag-carrying airline made the move after Foreign Office warned against "all but essential travel" to the country because of fears over the virus, which has now claimed more than 100 lives.

The suspension means all flights to and from mainland China are halted with immediate effect.

The Government body has already advised against all travel to Hubei Province due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak - which began in its capital of Wuhan.

In a statement, British Airways said: "We have suspended all flights to and from mainland China with immediate effect following advice from the Foreign Office against all but essential travel.

"We apologise to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority.

"Customers due to travel to or from China in the coming days can find more information on ba.com."

BA operates daily flights to Shanghai and Beijing from Heathrow.

The Foreign Office (FCO) has warned Britons not to travel to mainland China unless the journey is essential.

On Tuesday, January 28, the FCO updated their travel information to include a warning against 'all but essential' travel to the rest of mainland China - not including Hong Kong and Macao.

The statement added: "The Chinese government continue to impose further restrictions on movement within China in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

"It may become harder over the coming weeks for those who wish to leave China to do so.

"If you feel that you may want to leave China soon, you should consider making plans to do so before any further restrictions may be imposed."

The Wuhan authorities closed all transport hubs including airports, railway, and bus stations, with some shops and amenties also closed.

The deadly flu-like virus has killed more than 80 people and there are now almost 8,000 cases confirmed worldwide.

The first three cases in Europe were confirmed in France at the end of last week, and officials are now suggesting it's only a matter of days before cases are confirmed in the UK too.

Public Health England implemented enhanced monitoring on January 22 on all direct flights from Wuhan to the UK.

They have distributed leaflets and information at all UK airports and are advising travellers from China on what to do if they feel unwell.

There are currently no confirmed cases in the UK, with Public Health England assessing the risk as 'low'.
