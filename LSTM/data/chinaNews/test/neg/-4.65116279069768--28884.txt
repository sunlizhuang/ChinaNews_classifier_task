The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) is providing updates on the coronavirus outbreak.



On Monday, DHS said testing is in process for five people for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wisconsin. Results are pending on these cases. Test results for another patient under investigation came back negative.

The CDC says the 2019 Novel (new) Coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, is a virus identified as the cause of the respiratory illness outbreak first detected in Wuhan, China.

Wisconsin DHS says it is actively monitoring this outbreak. DHS has asked health care providers to alert the department if a person with recent travel to Wuhan has become sick with fever or respiratory symptoms.

Coronavirus isnâ€™t rare, the DHS said in a news release. In fact, the DHS said seasonal coronavirus activity typically increases in Wisconsin this time of year, along with influenza and other respiratory viruses. This particular strain of coronavirus is receiving attention because it is a novel, or new, form of the virus.

The DHS said people who are planning a trip to China should keep an eye on news reports and stay alert of the changing situation in the country. Anyone returning from China who is feeling sick should health care provider and let them know about the travel and symptoms before going to a clinic, office, or emergency room. This is to prevent the disease's spread.

DHS is providing updates on 2019 novel coronavirus, including case counts, on its Outbreaks and Investigations webpage. It will be updated by 2 p.m. each afternoon.
