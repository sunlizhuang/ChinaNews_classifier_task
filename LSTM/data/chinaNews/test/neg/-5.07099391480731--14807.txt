China on Monday reported a sharp spike in the number of people infected with a new SARS-like virus — as millions begin traveling for the Lunar New Year, fueling fears of a global outbreak.

Health officials in Wuhan, where the viral pneumonia apparently originated, said an additional 136 cases have been confirmed in the central city, which now has a total of 198 infected patients.

As of the weekend, a third patient had died, bringing the death toll to three. The country had confirmed a total of 217 cases of the coronavirus.

No human-to-human transmission has been confirmed yet, but health officials have not ruled out the possibility.

President Xi Jinping said the country would seek to control the spread of the outbreak, state media reported.

“People’s lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed,” he was quoted as saying.

Five people in the capital, Beijing, and 14 in southern China’s Guangdong also have been diagnosed with the illness, state broadcaster CCTV reported Monday.

A total of seven suspected cases have been detected in other parts of the country, including in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in the southwest and in Shanghai.

The outbreak has put other countries on alert during the heavy travel period.

Officials in Thailand and Japan have already identified at least three cases, all involving recent travel from China.

South Korea reported its first case Monday, when a Chinese woman from Wuhan tested positive a day after arriving at Seoul’s Incheon airport. She has been isolated at a state-run hospital in Incheon city, officials said.

At least a half-dozen countries in Asia and three US airports — including JFK in New York City — have begun screening incoming airline passengers from central China.

Coronaviruses cause diseases ranging from the common cold to SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which first infected people in southern China in late 2002 and spread to dozens of countries, killing nearly 800.

China initially tried to conceal the severity of the SARS epidemic, but its cover-up was exposed by a high-ranking physician.

“In the early days of SARS, reports were delayed and covered up,” said an editorial in the nationalistic Global Times. “That kind of thing must not happen again in China.”

“We have made great strides in medicine, social affairs management and public opinion since 2003,” it added.

The new virus did not slow down the annual holiday travel rush, though some travelers wore masks at crowded railway stations in Beijing and Shanghai.

“Watching the news, I do feel a little worried. But I haven’t taken precautionary measures beyond wearing regular masks,” Li Yang, a 28-year-old account manager who was headed to the northern region of Inner Mongolia for the Lunar New Year, told Agence France-Presse.
