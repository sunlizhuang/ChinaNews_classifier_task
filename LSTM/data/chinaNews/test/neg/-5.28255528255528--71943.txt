There are now 66,000 people confirmed sick with the coronavirus and more than 1,600 dead in China, according to numbers reported by the government. Hundreds have been infected globally.

Mr Wan’s resolve in the face of the virus is among the feel-good stories of sacrifice and dedication that Chinese state media has featured as authorities engineer a return to normal – even as more fall ill.

“I’m still not fully recovered now, but am much better than before,” he said.

Rather than despair, the family bed-in at home, dosing prescribed medicine and herbal remedies. Even after a fever and cough set in, Mr Wan still cleaned the bathroom once every three hours and simmered chicken soup daily for his family.

“We didn’t stand a chance...to be admitted to hospital and treated under isolation,” said Mr Wan, 45.

Test results were a surprise: The whole family, including his wife and daughter, had contracted the disease. But hospitals in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, were almost full.

Wan Qian felt perfectly healthy when examined after his mother-in-law was confirmed infected with the new coronavirus.

Still, the Chinese government is trying to reassure at home and abroad that everything is under control, turning up the propaganda machine to drown out the noise about medical supply shortages and doctors getting infected.

Xi Jinping, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, has ordered state media to “tell the moving stories of how those on the frontlines are preventing and fighting the virus” and to “showcase the spirit of solidarity among Chinese people and strong power against the virus.”

And it’s working. Just a week after an outpouring of grief and anger over the death of Li Wenliang, 34, a doctor punished by police for warning about the virus, Mr Wan’s interview – posted online by China’s state broadcaster – became a trending topic on Chinese social media with millions of views and comments.

“I was moved by your strict self-discipline and rational, peaceful mentality,” wrote one user. “You are already brilliant. You have taken good care of the elderly and your child,” said another. “I admire you so much.”

Reframing the narrative is crucial for the Chinese government, tasked with curbing the outbreak, softening the economic blow, and getting the country of 1.4 billion – many of whom are already tired of staying at home – to keep following quarantine directives.

To that end, giant red propaganda banners that typically extol the ruling Party now disseminate public service announcements.

“It's better to wear masks than respirators; it’s better to lay at home than in ICU,” reads one. “Not wearing a mask is like swimming a cesspool,” proclaims another.

There’s even been a political bloodbath to mitigate outrage over the botched initial emergency response. Government officials in Hubei province, where the disease originated, are getting blamed and sacked in a purge that deflects responsibility from Mr Xi.

In reality, the country remains in crisis mode. On Tuesday, Liu Xuerong, the most senior Party official in Huanggang, one of the hardest-hit by the virus, admitted the situation was “still very severe.”

People trying to share information continue to be suppressed. Citizen journalists Fang Bin and Chen Qiushi who streamed videos online showing long hospital lines and tearful relatives in Wuhan have disappeared.

At least 254 people were detained and fined for “spreading rumours” about the virus over just one week late January, according to Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a network of rights groups.

Experts stress that it’s too early to chart the virus’s course, about two months after China announced it was investigating a new disease.

“This outbreak could still go in any direction,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization.

More recently, clusters of people have been getting sick, suggesting the virus transmits quickly and in ways scientists have yet to pinpoint.

People living floors apart in Hong Kong were infected, possibly from an exposed sewage pipe. A British citizen who travelled through Europe is thought to have infected at least 10 others. In Tianjin, a city of 12 million, around one-third of more than 100 confirmed patients worked or shopped at a single department store.

China’s propaganda efforts – however effective now to tamp down panic – gloss over a strained healthcare system and bureaucratic political system that doesn’t allow for error.

And that could leave the country unprepared for the tough months ahead.

After Mr Wan’s state media interview aired Thursday, he went for a lung scan. It came back worse than the one before.

“The hardest part of this is that you cannot relax,” he said, as no cure exists. “After all, medicine is only supplementary.”
