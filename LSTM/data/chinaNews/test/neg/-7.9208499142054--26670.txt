Authorities in China are desperately trying to stop the spread of a deadly new coronavirus that has killed over 50 people and sickened thousands. Fifty-six million people in 14 cities in China have been placed under quarantine, and officials are worried that the epidemic is just getting started.

“At present, the rate of development of the epidemic is accelerating,” Ma Xiaowei, China’s National Health Commission (NHC) minister said. “I am afraid that it will continue for some time, and the number of cases may increase.”

Official figures from the Chinese government put the death toll at 56, with 2,600 suspected cases being investigated as of Sunday (January 26). There have been confirmed cases of the virus in Australia, France, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, and the United States

U.S. officials confirmed a third case of the coronavirus in a patient from Orange County, California. The patient recently traveled to Wuhan, the city that is at the center of the outbreak and remains hospitalized in an isolation unit.
