Feb. 21–When it comes to politics, Westminster has demonstrated a flair for drama — especially over the past year, with council members calling each other everything from dictators to communists.

So it’s little surprise that the effort to remove the city’s mayor and two like-minded council members has riled emotions all the more.

Mayor Tri Ta and colleagues Kimberly Ho and Chi Charlie Nguyen form a majority bloc — frequently dominating controversial votes decried by the remaining two council members.

A special election to recall and replace any or all of “the gang of three,” as critics refer to them, will take place April 7. The targeted trio denounce the mission to oust them as a farce funded by outside dollars.

Meanwhile, those on the other side complain of bombastic language, mean-spirited tactics and vandalized yard signs.

“Someone set fire to two signs on private property last weekend,” said David Johnson, a founder of recall organization Westminster United. “When they accuse us of being terrorists, it fans a culture of violence.”

The recall ballot will include a two-part question related to each official — first, whether the voter is for or against that individual’s recall. Whatever the answer, voters next can select a replacement should the recall succeed.

Eleven residents threw their hats in the ring as potential substitutes — three to replace Ta, six to replace Ho and two to replace Nguyen.

Among those attempting to nab the mayoral position is Councilman Tai Do — whose presence on the ballot exacerbates all the more the ongoing animosity at city council meetings. A Long Beach police officer elected to the council in 2018, Do repeatedly brands the majority as corrupt.

Attorney and Westminster School District board member Jamison Power hopes to seize Nguyen’s seat.

Both Do and Power learned that signs promoting their campaigns had been torched Saturday morning, Feb. 15. “It wasn’t even done under the veil of night,” Do noted.

Additionally, Do said, at least seven recall signs have been stolen.

“I blame these actions on the overheated rhetoric (of the officials under recall),” Power said. “You can agree to disagree without labeling people communists. Their message is: How dare you speak out against us?”

Ta said the problem cuts both ways. “The ‘No Recall’ signs are also being vandalized and stolen by the dozens,” he said. “Stealing and destroying political signs are against the law, and I do not condone these activities.”

On Monday, Feb. 17, Ta, Ho and Nguyen held a Vietnamese-language community meeting in Little Saigon to defend themselves against the recall. During the gathering, they distributed Power’s campaign finance filings, which include his home address.

“Why would you do that?” Power asked. “I have children. It would be common courtesy to redact an address. Taken in isolation, I would think the address was an oversight. But given everything else, it seems like another attempt at intimidation.”

Ta pointed out that the documents are easily obtainable at the City Clerk’s office. “He knew or should have known that this is all public information,” Ta said. “Still, it is not our intention to highlight his home address nor to invade his privacy.”

Rather, Ta said, “We publicized Mr. Power’s disclosure forms to highlight the large amount of money he received from one individual living outside of the city.”

Thousand Oaks billionaire Kieu Hoang, founder of Shanghai RAAS Blood Products, has donated $10,000 to Power’s campaign. Hoang also contributed thousands of dollars to Westminster United.

“I love America and I am committed to helping elect honest leaders from both parties and at all levels of government,” Hoang said in a January press release.

Ta chided Hoang’s largess as a “power grab” by a businessman who has “no ties to or track record with Westminster.”

However, Hoang is hardly an unknown in local political circles. For years, former California Assemblyman Van Tran worked as Hoang’s personal attorney. The first Vietnamese American to serve in a state legislature, Tran represented portions of Orange County from 2004 to 2010. Over the years, Hoang gave more than $20,000 to Tran’s campaigns.

But Hoang and Tran parted ways in 2018. Today, Tran works as Ta’s attorney and leads the anti-recall offensive.

In feisty commentary on his Facebook page, Hoang regularly ridicules Ta, Ho and Nguyen. Earlier this week, he posted a photo of their recent meeting with Little Saigon residents. In it, the three stand in front of an American flag that hangs on its pole upside-down — which can be interpreted as a distress signal. Hoang called the flag’s configuration an example of how the officials “threaten and suppress any opposition.”

But Ta asserted the flag’s display “was a simple oversight and there was no intention to send any message.” A volunteer hastily set up the flag before the meeting, he said, and no one noticed the mistake.

Ta predicted that the “frivolous and fact-free” recall will fail at the polls.

“It has no grassroots support,” he said. “Westminster residents see through this political charade.”
