Two Chinese nationals were held up at the China Harbor compound at Momote Airport in Manus Province on Monday morning.

Manus Provincial Police commander Chief Inspector David Yapu said four suspects covered their faces with masks and broke into the rooms of the two victims.

“They held them up with a gun, bush knives and iron rods and stole their mobile phones, clothing and K12,000 in cash in the cabinet.”

The suspects also assaulted the victims who sustained injuries to parts of their body and head, Mr Yapu said.

The incident occurred between 3am and 4am on Monday.

Mr Yapu said the rest of the Chinese workers had left the project site at Momote Airport after the re-development project of the airport was completed last year, leaving the two behind to look after the company’s properties.

Yapu said the incident was reported to police and CID officers are investigating the incident.

He appealed to the ward members of nearby villages at Naringel and RiuRiu, including the community leaders in the Los Negros local level government (LLG) to help police and provide information of the likely suspects involved in the incident.
