There’s a horrifying photo you may have seen. There have been others like it, but in the latest iteration, a man lies flat on the streets of a Chinese city. He appears to be dead. Two other people, clad in full protective gear, stand apprehensively nearby.

Photos like this — China in the grips of the coronavirus epidemic — seem like something out of a horror movie, or medieval times, or Stephen King’s epic novel The Stand. But photos don’t tell the whole story. By all indications thus far, the Chinese people are holding up well under this terrible threat. And for all we know, that man died of a heart attack while out for a morning stroll. Maybe he’s simply drunk. The responsible observer does not look at that photo and conclude that in China, people are dropping like flies in the streets.

But that’s been the problem all along. We don’t really know what we’re up against. We don’t know how bad it will get in China. You don’t know how bad it will get here.

At the start of this week, I remarked to a colleague that in seven days, we’d know where we stood. Many of the headlines this week have been alarming, with travel bans and isolated cases popping up all over the world. At the same time, as the sample size of known patients increases, the mortality rate is trending down. If there are vast numbers of infected who suffered only mild symptoms and thought nothing of it, or had no symptoms at all, the mortality rate could in fact plummet into something no worse, if even as bad, as seasonal influenza, which kills thousands of Canadians each year with almost no public comment or concern. Public health authorities all over the world, armed with some of the lessons of the 2003 SARS epidemic in China, Hong Kong and Toronto, are working to contain the spread. We’re not batting a thousand — Japan, Germany and the United States have all confirmed cases of person-to-person transmission into new victims with no recent travel to China. But those cases, for now, remain a relative handful.

Only history will tell us what comes next. But even early into this crisis, there are some positive signs that lessons from 2003 have been learned and acted upon. There are also some worrying signs that those lessons won’t matter, or that the lessons, while learned, have not been fully implemented.

Let’s start with the good news. China has reacted with extreme determination to lock this epidemic down. By quarantining tens of millions of people and extending the Lunar New Year holidays, effectively idling its economy to keep people home, the transmission of the virus will be reduced (by how much, we can’t say). Technical progress has improved our capability to rapidly detect and sequence the virus, which will speed the creation of vaccines, though that’s still going to take months. The international community has improved its communications considerably since 2003. Closer to home, in stark contrast to the SARS epidemic, stockpiles of medical equipment, particularly protective face masks, gloves, goggles and scrubs, are much more robust than in 2003.

But there’s also bad news. China’s efforts to contain the epidemic quite possibly came too late. Although much has been made of the fact that this new coronavirus seems less lethal than SARS, some of that could be explained by advancements in medical technology and technique over the past 17 years. If hospitals were to become overwhelmed with severely ill patients, the benefit of those improvements could be lost, and the death rate could spike. Further, we are simply a more interconnected species on this Earth. There are more of us, we live in denser cities and we travel the globe more than ever. It is far from clear that anything other than a complete shutting of all borders would really contain something like this, and it’s very clear that none of our economies could long withstand that kind of shock to international trade.

It will be several days, perhaps as long as a week, before we start to get a real sense how this will play out. The full effects of the Chinese quarantine are as yet unknowable. Our best estimate of the incubation period of this virus suggests that as long as two weeks is possible — that’s longer than the quarantine has been in place, meaning cases detected today could well date to before the lockdown. When dealing with such long potential incubation periods, there is a considerable gap between an action being taken and any effect being observable.

We live in that lag time. And we must simply wait it out.

I recently interviewed a Canadian public health official and she said she was holding her breath and would be for another week or two. It brought to mind the archived copies of what the major U.S. news networks were showing on their morning programs on a lovely September Tuesday not quite two decades ago. All of the broadcasts have little clocks in the corners. The first plane struck the World Trade Center at 8:46 a.m. It took all the networks a few minutes to start interrupting their normal cheerful morning coverage to report the crash — and even longer to begin speculating that it might be anything other than a horrific accident. I’ve thought often of those long, confused minutes. They were a holdover from an earlier era, beamed at the speed of light into the homes of tens of millions of people, most of whom — anyone who couldn’t see the WTC from their balcony, really — had no idea the world had changed.

Three months from now, we’ll know if our world has changed. For now, we wait.

What do we do in the meantime? What is the right response? We’ve seen a lot of responses already. N95 filter masks and hand sanitizer vanished off the shelves in days. North American airlines are curtailing or suspending entirely their flights in and out of China. Public health authorities are holding regular briefings, keeping the public up to date (as this was being written, health officials in Ontario announced a third case in that province, though the patient, a young woman, had isolated herself since returning from a trip to China; the odds of her having infected others, according to the officials, were low). Every day this week, it seemed, more and more people on the streets of Toronto peered out from behind masks.

This all may prove unnecessary. But there’s still value in the exercise. If this coronavirus proves serious for the world beyond China’s borders, we’ll deal with that as best we can. If it fizzles out, or should China’s containment efforts succeed, then we’ve all been put through a valuable experience — a completely unplanned emergency drill.

All across the world, our governments, health agencies, private institutions and families are asking themselves what-if questions that aren’t normally pleasant to think about. We’re discovering gaps in our plans, if there were plans at all. One day, this may prove useful. But hopefully not today.
