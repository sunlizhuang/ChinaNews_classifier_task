“It was something kind of in the back of our heads,” Ng said of the virus. “It wasn’t a huge concern.”

Another spectator, Ethan Donnelly, said he works at the University of B.C. and a co-worker who is from China skipped this year’s celebrations for fear of the virus.

“We want to celebrate, but better safe than sorry,” he said, gesturing to the mask he wore during the parade.

Though some donned the surgical masks at the event, experts advise against them, saying the ones widely available at drug stores aren’t particularly effective and noting that repeatedly adjusting them with unwashed hands can actually exacerbate risk of infection.

Ella Lewis-Vass, who also works and studies at the university, said she believed those who were most concerned about contracting the virus likely stayed home.

The illness has sickened at least 1,975 people and killed 56 in China, but it remains to be seen whether it’s as dangerous as the common flu, which kills 3,500 people every year in Canada alone.
