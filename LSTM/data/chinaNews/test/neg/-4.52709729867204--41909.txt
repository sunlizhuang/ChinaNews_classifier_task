Though the new coronavirus is a serious public health problem and has raised concerns around the globe, the risk to most people outside of China remains very low. In the United States, seasonal flu is a bigger problem.

The coronavirus has officially made landfall in the United States, but something more dangerous and much deadlier is a bigger threat to local residents and has been infecting millions of Americans, health officials say.

“You are much more likely to have influenza,” said Dr. Nora Colburn, an infectious disease physician at Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center. “For a typical Ohioan or American, that would be the bigger concern.”

Not only right now, she said, but every year.

So far, there have been an estimated 19 million cases of flu, 180,000 hospitalizations and 10,000 deaths in the U.S. this influenza season — including more than 60 children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Worldwide, seasonal influenza epidemics cause between 3 million and 5 million severe cases every year and kill up to 650,000 people per year, according to the World Health Organization.

“That just far surpasses the amount of cases compared to the novel coronavirus,” Colburn said. “If you didn’t travel specifically to Wuhan, China, or have contact with a person with suspected or known coronavirus, your chance of contracting this is extremely low.”

In Ohio, there have been 3,642 confirmed flu hospitalizations and at least one flu-related death of a child, as of Jan. 25, according to the Ohio Department of Health. The department keeps track only of pediatric flu deaths.

However, the CDC reported 30 flu-related deaths among people of all ages this season in Ohio.

“The biggest health threat to our state right now is the influenza, not the coronavirus,” reiterated Dr. Mark Hurst, director of the Ohio Department of Health.

That’s not to say the coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan in December and has spread quickly with about 9,800 confirmed cases and 213 deaths in China as of Friday, shouldn’t be taken seriously.

To be sure, the World Health Organization on Thursday declared the coronavirus a global health emergency, and the Trump administration declared Friday that the coronavirus is a public health emergency, and ordered any U.S. citizens coming back from the center of the outbreak in China to be quarantined for two weeks.

Still, the risk of contracting it in the United States is low, health officials said. A bigger worry is that Americans aren’t adequately concerned about the flu, Hurst said.

“The flu is something that people feel like they know,” he said. “It follows a predictable course. It’s something that’s familiar to people. It brings an undeserved sense of comfort about it.”

Because flu season peaks between December and February, the worst still could be to come.

In a bad year, influenza kills up to 61,000 Americans, according to the CDC.

A 16-year-old girl from Cuyahoga County was the state’s first flu-associated pediatric death of the 2019-20 flu season.

And flu is leaving a mark on schools across the state, causing the closure of schools or entire districts for cleaning in Ross, Licking, Fayette and Pike counties.

The best way to prevent the misery of the flu and its complications is to get vaccinated, especially for children and the elderly, health officials said. And it’s still not too late, but many people don’t, Colburn said.

Just under half of American adults got a flu shot last season, and 62% of children were vaccinated, according to the CDC.

Unlike the flu, there is no vaccine for the coronavirus right now, and no one knows exactly how it is spread.

The first case of coronavirus was reported in the United States on Jan. 21 in Washington state, and U.S. officials on Thursday announced the first confirmed report of the virus spreading person-to-person in the country, saying the husband of a patient diagnosed in Chicago had tested positive for coronavirus.

In Ohio, health officials announced Tuesday that they are investigating two possible cases of coronavirus at Miami University. The two students returned to Oxford after a trip to China, and one of the students went to Miami University’s Student Health Services after complaining of not feeling good.

The State Department warned Americans on Thursday not to travel to China because of the coronavirus, and Ohio State University is temporarily restricting university-sponsored travel to China for all faculty, staff and students. The ban went into effect Thursday and will remain in place until at least March 6.

Symptoms of the coronavirus are similar to the flu and include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Some patients show only mild symptoms and recover, but others have developed life-threatening complications such as pneumonia.

“There’s a lot that we don’t know,” Colburn said. ”So that’s, I think, part of the issue why people are so nervous.”

Some nervousness surrounding the coronavirus can be a good thing and will help people be more prepared, said Travis Westbrook, a clinical psychologist at Wexner Medical Center.

But if your anxiety about the coronavirus is overwhelming, he said, it could be time to seek professional help.

“People are anxious because anxiety is a common response to things that are new and threatening,” he said. “Coronavirus is new.”
