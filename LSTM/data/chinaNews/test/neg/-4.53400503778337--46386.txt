Pakistanâ€™s armed forces rendered matchless sacrifices to establish peace in country: Analysts

Dr. Zahid Anwar Khan (IR Expert):

It is good development that a monitoring team of United Nations admitted that Pakistan is a victim of cross-border terrorism emanating from Afghanistan. Pakistan has made great efforts in eliminating the menace of terrorism from its oil, rendered many sacrifices and faced huge financial loss as well. The government with the support of military forces managed to establish its writ in Tribal areas. The world is gradually acknowledging the role of Pakistan in war against terror. Pakistan paid a heavy price of being the part of US war on terror in terms of financial instability. Now, it is the moral duty of developed nations to support Pakistan economically. Pakistan has always played a vital role in regional peace and stability. Islamabad using its influence succeeded to convince Taliban to come on negotiation table with the United States.

Tahir Khan (Expert on Afghan Affairs):

The UN reports are research based and authentic. Pakistan on its side has taken strict measures against the militants and managed to restore peace in the country. The militants then flee to Afghanistan and have safe havens there. These militants are now targeting the security personnel in Pakistan's areas. It is the responsibility of Afghan government and NATO forces to take strict action against the militants. These militants are also involved in attacking the army soldiers busy in fencing along Pak-Afghan border.

Brig (Retd) Mehmood Shah (Defense Analyst):

It is a positive development that the UN has endorsed that Pakistan is victim of cross-border terror. Pakistan has already taken certain measures to comply with the guidelines of FATF. The next meeting of FATF is scheduled in China. The member countries have acknowledged the role of Pakistan against terror financing. The recent report will be helpful for the member countries to know that Pakistan itself is the victim of terrorism. The image of Pakistan is gradually improving in the world.

Dr. A.Z. Hilali (IR Expert):

The report of monitoring team of the United Nations is victory of Pakistani narrative, its diplomacy and it is an acknowledgement of sacrifices of Pakistan in war against terror. The war against terror badly affected the infrastructure of the country and economic stability. Now, international organizations are appreciating the efforts made by Pakistan in this regard.

Brig (Retd) Tipu Sultan (Defense Analyst):

The inaccessible and mountainous tribal area was home to a swirling array of militants. Our security forces targeted the hideouts of the militants and destroyed them. Some so called leaders are being sponsored by anti-Pakistan elements as they have been following a big propaganda and uproar against government but all these tactics will meet a disastrous fate.
