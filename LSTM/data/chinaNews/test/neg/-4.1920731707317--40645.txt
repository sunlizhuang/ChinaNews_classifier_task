The deadly coronavirus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019 and has since spread to other parts of the world including Europe, Australasia and Asia.

The flu-like strain is transmitted via droplets in coughs and sneezes and has so far killed 213 with almost 9,692 people infected.

Cases of coronavirus in the UK have been confirmed by Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty.

Chinese authorities have put the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is located, on lockdown and public transport has been stopped.

Residents have been warned to stay in the city and not to gather in groups.

What is coronavirus and what are the symptoms?

Coronavirus comes from a family of viruses which give rise to a huge range of illnesses from the mild common cold to severe SARS and MERS.

It is thought to have originated from animals and traces of the disease were found at a live animal market in Wuhan which also sold poultry and seafood.

The contagious virus is airborne and spreads via droplets which can be transmitted via coughs and sneezes – this has led to lots of people in the region wearing facemasks.

Initial symptoms of the infection include fever, cough, tightness of the chest, runny nose, headache and shortness of breath.

Later signs include chills and body aches.

Coronaviruses are named after the spikes that protrude from their membranes, like the sun’s corona.

Because SARS and MERS proved deadly, the emergence of a new coronavirus has been treated with caution.
