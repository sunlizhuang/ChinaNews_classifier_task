Lunar New Year just began, but adidas is already getting a head start on the final celebrations. Ahead of the Lantern Festival, traditionally denoting the end of Lunar New Year celebrations, the Three Stripes has prepped a special edition UltraBOOST DNA sneaker, dubbed “Yuanxiao”

The phrase “yuanxiao” simply refers to glutinous rice balls, but as The World of Chinese explains, the treat “is steeped in the tradition and spirit of the Lantern Festival, symbolizing family, harmony, and happiness.” Representative of the flowers often arranged in celebration of the event, the designs on the UltraBOOST DNA are lavish, yet understated, with a textured upper showcasing a bevy of complementary plants and patterns. Black nubuck on the toebox matches the black midsole, sockliner and plastic cage, serving as a base for the thematic red and gold accents, including the shiny adidas logo on the tongue.

Look for the UltraBOOST DNA “Yuanxiao” to hit adidas’ website for $180 USD on February 8, the same day as 2020’s Lantern Festival.

adidas has more timely sneaker silhouettes rolling out this month, including a pack of Valentine’s Day-themed kicks.
