At a Glance At least 1,000 have been killed by the coronavirus worldwide.

More than 40,570 people are infected worldwide, most in China.

The number of fatalities has surpassed the number of deaths in the 2002-03 SARS pandemic.

Another 65 cases of coronavirus were confirmed aboard the Diamond Princess. Officials said early Tuesday morning that the death toll from the novel coronavirus had surpassed 1,000, with nearly all of those deaths occurring in mainland China.

On Monday, an additional 65 cases were found on the Diamond Princess, which is quarantined in the port of Yokohama near Tokyo, the Associated Press reported. That's on top of 70 reported earlier. The Japanese government was considering testing all 3,711 passengers and crew on the ship, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said.

Beyond dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, health authorities are scrambling to deliver medicine requested by more than 600 other passengers. Elderly people and others with disabilities and chronic diseases are not getting enough support, a group of Japanese passengers on the Diamond Princess said Monday.

“Our living environment on board has rapidly deteriorated and we need the issues addressed quickly,” the group said Monday in a statement released through Japanese media. They asked officials to speed up the delivery of refills of prescription medicine, dispatch more medical staff and improve their living conditions, including more frequent room cleaning.

“We are increasingly getting worried, as information released to the passengers is insufficient,” they said.

Meanwhile, mainland China reported a rise in cases of the new coronavirus after a sharp decline the previous day, according to AP. The number of deaths there jumped by 97 to 908.

By the Numbers

The outbreak of the new coronavirus, which began in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei province in central China, has now killed at least 1,013 people: 1,011 in mainland China and two outside the country.

It has spread to at least 27 other countries and territories.

The number of coronavirus deaths has surpassed the number of fatalities in the 2002-03 SARS pandemic. SARS is widely considered to have killed 774 people.

As of Tuesday, more than 42,000 people have been infected worldwide. Most of those are in China, but more than 450 cases have been confirmed outside mainland China.
