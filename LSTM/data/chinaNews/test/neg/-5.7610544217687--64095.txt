As the death toll increases to more than 900, a Chinese official has warned the deadly respiratory infection can be caught through aerosol transmission.

An official in Shanghai confirmed the virus wasn't just passed on through human contact but can float long distances through the air.

This means the coronavirus can cause infections when breathed in, the Chinese official said.

“Aerosol transmission refers to the mixing of the virus with droplets in the air to form aerosols, which causes infection after inhalation, according to medical experts,” Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau deputy head Zeng Qun said at press briefing on Saturday, China Daily reports.

The government has gone as far as to warn people to avoid social gatherings to prevent the virus from spreading further.

“As such, we have called on the public to raise their awareness of the prevention and control of the disease caused by family gatherings,” Qun said.
