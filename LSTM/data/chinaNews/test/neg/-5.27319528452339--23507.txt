NEW BEDFORD — Southcoast Health is preparing medical staff to respond to the spread of the coronavirus that has sickened more than 800 people in China and led to at least 26 deaths there, officials announced in a press release.

Two confirmed cases (one in Washington state and the other in Chicago) had been identified in the United States as of Friday morning, and no cases of the disease have been identified in Massachusetts, according to the release.

Dr. Dani Hackner, chief clinical officer for Southcoast Health, said that because Southeastern Massachusetts is not near a major airport serving China or Southeast Asia that is triaging travelers, he believes the region is “probably a low-risk area” for a major outbreak of the virus, which causes mild to severe respiratory infection.

“But we’re not planning for luck, we’re planning for safety,” said Hackner, who added that Southcoast’s leadership is meeting daily and communicating with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the Centers for Disease Control, and other entities.

Southcoast Health officials said procedures are being implemented to protect both staff and patients from spreading the infection, which epidemiologists say resembles novel pathogens like SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), which previously caused serious outbreaks in Asia and Saudi Arabia.

Dr. Eliesel Lacerda De La Cruz, an infectious disease specialist who leads Southcoast’s Antimicrobial Center for Excellence — charged with implementing policies and procedures for prevention and containment — called the Wuhan coronavirus a “potentially very serious infection.”

That means educating staff about the virus and measures to contain it, careful assessment of patients who arrive at a Southcoast urgent care clinic or the emergency room with symptoms of a respiratory infection, and isolation of potential victims, according to the press release.

Southcoast Hospitals dealt with a serious influenza outbreak, which infected 45 million in 2017 and resulted in tens of thousands of deaths worldwide, and responded last year to concerns about potential cases of the measles, officials noted.

Hackner said medical staff will be wearing surgical masks in treating anyone suspected of a serious respiratory infection, and patients who are treated at Southcoast Hospitals for respiratory infections also will be asked to wear surgical masks.

However, neither he nor Lacerda De La Cruz recommends that people who live in regions like southeastern Massachusetts and are at lower risk of infection purchase surgical or N-95 masks to guard against infection.

“Lots of hand washing” and paying attention to the onset of symptoms are what Southcoast is recommending now, Hackner said. “You’re not going to get a coronavirus over a distance” of more than about six feet for a “prolonged period of time.”

Because the outbreak is viral, antibiotics are ineffective in treating the disease, Hackner said. Medical staff would provide supportive care for an infected patient with fluids, fever reducers and oxygen, if the patient is having trouble breathing.

Hackner said people should monitor any respiratory infection, making sure they take their temperature and calling their primary care physician for guidance. People with more serious symptoms — high fever, chest pain, or difficulty breathing — should seek medical attention immediately and should alert medical staff if they have traveled in Asia recently.

For others suffering more routine respiratory infections, Hackner recommends fluids, monitoring for fever and seeing whether symptoms improve over two or three days. If they worsen rather than improve, patients should seek medical attention promptly because “at that point you may be facing something serious.”

Hackner said Southcoast Health will act “quickly but methodically” in its workflows — including immediately sending multiple specimens to the CDC lab — if a patient who has traveled to China and Southeast Asia presents with related symptoms.

The virus, which was first identified in Wuhan, China, a city of more than 11 million, can be spread from person to person, the press release noted. The outbreak has led to the travel restrictions in at least 10 cities in China and a lockdown that affects some 30 million people. The contagion, which has caused mild to severe respiratory infection, has spread elsewhere in Asia, with 22 cases identified worldwide outside of China.

Children, people 65 and older, and those with medical conditions are at greatest risk of serious illness, according to the release.
