The province is preparing in case the deadly virus that killed approximately 40 per cent of Chinese pigs makes its way to Manitoba, which could be a huge issue for domestic producers.

The outbreak of African swine fever in China is a potential boon for Manitoba pork producers because of a severe shortage of pigs in the pork-hungry country — but the province is preparing for a potential disaster if the deadly disease shows up in domestic swine.

The disease hasn’t been seen in Canada, but attempts to contain the spread of the lethal disease by culling herds has created a pork shortage in China.

"This is a fast-acting, very high mortality, lethal virus. Certainly, there are clinical signs associated with it that farmers can recognize: loss of appetite, reddening of the skin, there’s fever, overall illness but ultimately you’re going to have a lot of dead hogs," said Dr. Scott Zaari, Manitoba’s chief veterinary officer.

"You have a virus that is killing hogs immediately that doesn’t have a vaccine, where there’s no treatment, you have a chaotic situation and that’s been occurring since the first outbreak in China was noticed in 2018."

The disease, which is harmless to humans, can be spread through pigs eating infected meat.

Manitoba is working with the other western provinces, along with the federal government, to prevent the disease from reaching the domestic market and what to do in the event it does, Zaari said.

"We have a unique incident here where this doesn’t usually happen, where we’ve said ‘This is a western issue and let’s look at how we can combat it at a western level,’" he said.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is leading the effort to keep African swine fever out of Canada. Zaari said the best methods of prevention are to control imports of pork products from infected countries and making sure travellers know not to bring home at-risk products.

The western provinces have formed a western steering advisory committee to "combine forces" on preparedness efforts. He said the provinces are looking at what financial compensation packages look like if a producer’s livestock were affected and developing a provincial response plan.

While Zaari couldn’t say how likely it is that the disease could reach Canada, it has been seen in Russia, Poland and other European countries. The provincial government and federal agencies are preparing as if African swine fever will show up in the country.

Pork is big business in Manitoba. Andrew Dickson, general manager of Manitoba Pork, told the Sun on Thursday the shortage of pork in China is an opportunity for Manitoba producers, despite the risk of it showing up here. He said that in 2020, the advocacy organization expects Canada could sell approximately $200 million worth of pork to China this year.

HyLife president Grant Lazaruk told the Sun the shortage has increased demand in China, the biggest consumer of pork around the world, and the company is expecting to increase sales this year.

Zaari estimates 14,000 jobs in southern Manitoba rely on the pork industry, and it contributes $2 billion to the provincial economy. Much of that goes toward the export market, which would shut down entirely if African swine fever is found.

"We have so many jobs in Manitoba that rely on the swine sector so it’s a cross-cutting issue, so I see this as very much it’s not just an animal issue, it’s an issue that’ll have wide-reaching effects," he said.

Provincial Minister of Agriculture Blaine Pedersen agreed the response to the disease if it shows up in Canada is important, saying the province has been advocating for the federal government to be more involved with the potential response straight from the start of any future outbreak.

"Our provincial government, as best we can, understands the potential fallout should it happen, and we just need to make sure the federal government is on side," he said. "In this case, we need the federal government to be right there, right beside us from the start."

Any cost associated with African swine fever showing up in Canada depends on how severe the outbreak is and how quickly it can be contained. Pedersen said all stakeholders are staying vigilant for it showing up in the domestic market.

"We’re working very closely with the industry and the federal government and all provinces. … It’s a matter of making sure we’re as co-ordinated as we possibly can be."
