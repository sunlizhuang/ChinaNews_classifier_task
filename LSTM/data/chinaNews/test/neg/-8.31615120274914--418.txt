A mysterious outbreak of pneumonia that has infected dozens of people in China is still baffling scientists.

Doctors have ruled out severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as being the cause of the virus which has struck 59 people in Wuhan.

Seven patients are in a critical condition, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced it is closely monitoring the situation.

Other possible cases have cropped up in 15 travellers who returned to Hong Kong and following visits to the city in Hubei province. One suspected case was also reported in Singapore.

The two nations have put new screening measures in place following fears travellers will spread the mystery illness.

It was feared the life-threatening SARS, a highly contagious virus, was behind the flurry of cases in Wuhan.

SARS killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in the early 2000s. But no cases have been recorded in the world since 2004.

But SARS, bird flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome and adenovirus have now been ruled out following investigations, authorities have said.

The outbreak – which began at the start of December – has prompted the closure of a seafood market in Wuhan's suburbs, where several patients worked.

The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement on Sunday evening: 'We have excluded several hypotheses, in particular the fact that it is a flu, an avian flu, an adenovirus, respiratory syndrome severe acute (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).'

Some 163 people who had been in contact with those infected are currently under medical observation, while efforts continue to try and identify the virus.

No obvious human-to-human transmission has been found and no medical staff had been infected, the commission previously said.

Experts from the National Health Commission is to carry out further tests, in hope of finding a cause of the cases.

Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said Sunday that a total of 15 patients in Hong Kong were being treated for symptoms including fever and respiratory infection after recent visits to Wuhan. Tests have yet to confirm if they have the same illness.

Hospitals and doctors have been directed to report cases of fever in anyone who has travelled to Wuhan in the past 14 days. The city is home to 11million people.

The hospital authority said it activated a newly created 'serious response' level over the weekend to curb spread of the infection.

The city's health department added an additional thermal imaging system at Hong Kong's airport to check if arriving passengers had a high temperature.

More staff have been assigned to carry out temperature checks at the West Kowloon high-speed rail station, which connects Hong Kong to mainland China.

Hong Kong's health chief Sophia Chan warned residents against visiting wet markets – places that sell fresh meat – and eating wild game in mainland China.

The South China Seafood City food market, where many of the infected patients had worked, has been suspended until investigations are complete.

But the two latest possible cases in Hong Kong – two females, aged 12 and 41 – are not thought to have visited the market during a trip to Wuhan.

The South China Morning Post reported Singapore has had one suspicious case of the mystery illness.

The Ministry of Health said on January 4 that it had been notified of a three-year-old girl from China who had been to Wuhan and was suspected to have the illness, The Straits Times reported.

She had been isolated as a precautionary measure and preliminary tests suggested respiratory syncytial virus had caused pneumonia. It is not clear how she was uncovered as a suspected case of the mystery virus.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was closely monitoring the situation and maintaining contact with Chinese authorities.

It added 'the reported link to a wholesale fish and live animal market could indicate an exposure link to animals'.

But the agency added that no travel or trade restrictions are necessary at this time.

The mystery condition's most common symptom is fever, with shortness of breath and lung infections appearing in a 'small number' of cases.

Typical symptoms of SARS include a high temperature, fatigue and headache, with a dry cough and breathing difficulties arising later on.

The 2002-2003 SARS epidemic started in southern China and killed more than 700 people in mainland China, Hong Kong and elsewhere.

The WHO criticised China for under-reporting the number of cases following the outbreak, which infected four people in the UK.

China sacked its then-health minister Zhang Wenkang for the poor handling of the crisis, several months after the first case was reported.

Online speculation about a resurgence of SARS began when the mystery infection was first reported in Wuhan.

Wuhan police on Wednesday said they had punished eight people for 'publishing or forwarding false information on the internet without verification'.
