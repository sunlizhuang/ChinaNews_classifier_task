Mumbai: Mahindra & Mahindra expects a hit on production of some of its BS-IV vehicles due to disruption of components supply from China, where the coronavirus outbreak has forced several plants into temporary shutdown. The company’s managing director, Pawan Goenka, said the situation may delay delivery of BS IV-compliant vehicles.The deadline set by the government for registration of new BS-IV vehicles is March 31 this year, after which the stricter BS-VI emission norms kick in. “If markets don’t open in a few days, then it will be a challenge to deliver BS-IV vehicles on time,” Goenka told reporters on Tuesday. He said the company may seek an extension in deadline to register the BS-IV vehicles — a scenario that will become clear over the next two-three weeks. The company had declared third-quarter results last week.Earlier, on the sidelines of Auto Expo 2020 in Delhi, Goenka had said that shortage of tier-2 components because suppliers in China were not able to resume work may hit production of certain vehicles made by the company.This disruption in supply of components could be a cause for worry for India’s automotive industry which is working to align with the rollout of BSVI emission norms from April 1 this year. Some experts say that if supplies continue to be affected for a few more weeks, auto makers may seek an extension for implementation of BS-VI norms.Chinese auto parts suppliers have a good exposure in India. In 2018-19, India had imported automotive components worth $4.5 billion from China.Scores of auto parts suppliers have factories in China’s Hubei province — the epicentre of the virus outbreak--including more than half of the top 20 global parts makers such as Robert Bosch, Valeo and ZF Friedrichshafen, according to China Automotive Technology & Research Centre.Meanwhile, with no clarity on how soon components production in China will normalise, auto companies in India are adopting a wait and watch policy.
