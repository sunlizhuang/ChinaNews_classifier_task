US officials have issued an ‘unprecedented’ federal quarantine for all 195 passengers evacuated from Wuhan, and said Friday that their test for the new coronavirus may come back negative if someone hasn’t developed symptoms – but they could later become ill.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Director of National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Dr Nancy Messonnier, called the coronavirus outbreak an ‘unprecedented health threat,’ as she revealed that worldwide cases have increased by 26 percent in just 24 hours during a press briefing.

It comes after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday. The US also advised against all travel to China and a quarantine was ordered for the 195 passengers evacuated from Wuhan after one attempted to flee March Reserve air base in Riverside County.

It was the first time the CDC had mandated a quarantine in 50 years.

A recent New England Journal of Medicine study documented the first case of coronavirus transmission from a patient who did not have symptoms to another person.

This revelation is particularly concerning in light of Dr Messonnier’s Friday disclosure that a person can still develop the illness later after testing negative for coronavirus while they were symptom-free.

Although officials underscored the seriousness of the ongoing outbreak, they also reminded press that the disease is not spreading actively in US communities.

Additionally, Thursday was the first time officials confirmed case of person-to-person case transmission of coronavirus in the US after a man in Illinois was infected by his wife, who had previously traveled to China.

‘The main reason for this declaration is not for what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries,’ Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO Director-General, said at a press conference.

‘Our greatest concern is for the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems, which are ill prepared to deal with it.’

He added that the declaration didn’t mean a ‘vote of no confidence in China’ and, in fact, congratulated the Chinese government for taking ‘extraordinary measures’ to contain the outbreak.

This marks the fifth time the WHO has made such a declaration since the rule to do was implemented in 2005: for the influenza pandemic of 2009, a resurgence of polio 2014, the Ebola crisis in 2014, the outbreak of Zika virus outbreak in 2016 and the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2019.

Such a declaration does not give the WHO more money, but officials can make recommendation on travel or trade was well as mobilize public and political action.
