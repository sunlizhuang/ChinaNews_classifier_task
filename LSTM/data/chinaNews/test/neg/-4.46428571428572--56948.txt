'Contact tracing' is one of the hottest key words in South Korea at the moment.It tracks the history, timeline and the locations visited of a coronavirus patient.Amid the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak,information such as the restaurant and hotel the confirmed patient went to, how they had arrived,which subway line or the number of the bus they took, is shown.Even the seat they had sat in at the movie theater is being revealed."This is the movie theater in central Seoul where the fifth confirmed patient visited a day after arriving from Wuhan. In response, the theater closed temporarily and quarantined the area. It reopened on Monday, but still seems quite empty."In order to contain the virus from spreading, the cinema has tripled their quarantine measures by hiring fumigators.The cinema have provided hand sanitizers for customers as well.However, citizens are still not convinced."After I heard this area was contaminated, I stopped coming. I nearly came with my mask on after the disinfection. But I'm still scared. I check the information every morning."Contact tracing is changing people's daily lives.Citizens are checking the coronavirus locations and are avoiding going to these areas.Experts say however, tracing information is not a list of places to avoid,but rather critical in checking the possibility of infection."The infected areas are already quarantined. So there's no need to avoid entering these areas. The virus can only survive for a few hours,a day or two maximum. Moreover, if it's quarantined, the virus is 100 percent eliminated."He also said that tracing is best used to check whether one was in the same area as the confirmed patient.If this was the case, one should watch closely for related symptoms and report to health authorities quickly should they begin to show.He added that it's important to keep track of the updated information to check the possibility of further infection.Choi Jeong-yoon, Arirang News.
