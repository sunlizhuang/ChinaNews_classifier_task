A top secret spy claims New Zealand is 'compromised' due to Chinese influence and they could lose their membership with intelligence agency Five Eyes.

The unnamed senior intelligence official alleges New Zealand's membership is 'on the edge of viability' as they have a weak attitude towards the communist country, the Financial Times reported.

The Financial Times claims New Zealand is 'attractive to Beijing as the soft underbelly' of Five Eyes.

In 2018, a US analyst said 'the CCP [Chinese Communist party] has gotten very close to or inside the political core' of New Zealand and Australia.

Opposition leader Simon Bridges was accused of violating electoral laws when he accepted a $100,000 donation from a Chinese businessman.

In December, a ban on foreign donations over $50 to political parties was announced by Mr Little.

'The new law bans all foreign donations over $50 and places a due diligence requirement on party general secretaries in relation to all donations,' he said.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was slammed by Anderlini for allegedly going 'out of her way to avoid even mentioning the topic of Chinese political interference'.

Five Eyes is an intelligence alliance which has Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States as its members.
