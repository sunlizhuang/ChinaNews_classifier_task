The country’s tourism industry has been affected by the Coronavirus outbreak due to the Chinese tourists cancelling their bookings, the Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) told the Daily News yesterday.

Chinese tourists were due to reach Sri Lanka for their Chinese New Year (CNY) vacation during the outbreak there have cancelled their bookings, a senior official said.

SLTDA Public Relations Director Madhubani Perera said Sri Lanka was expecting around 25,000 Chinese tourists during the CNY.

“Majority of the bookings have been cancelled. Usually two or three weeks from January 25, a large number of Chinese tourists arrive in Sri Lanka. Following the Easter Sunday terror attack, our tourism industry was looking for rejuvenation and this season was our target. However, due to this epidemic we have lost that opportunity. In addition, we cannot revive this market for a considerable time period also.We had planned a promotional campaign in China as well in February, which most probably we would either have to postpone or cancel” Perera said.
