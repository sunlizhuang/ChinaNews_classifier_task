“The parents of the (Yakima) students were disappointed but understood (the decision) and some expressed that they were thankful that the trip was not going to take place,” said Fitterer. “At the time the decision was made, there wasn’t as much information as there is now, but we were anticipating that it could get much worse, and it has. So we’re happy about the decision that was made by Hou Kong Schools.”

Fitterer said she had not received updates from Hou Kong Schools since the trip had been canceled and did not know if they had been further impacted by the virus. She said Yakima schools hope to reschedule the trip later, once it is advisable to travel to Macao again.
