Since yesterday, a book has been making its presence felt on the internet is The Eyes of Darkness by Dean Koontz.

The reason for this sudden limelight: With the ongoing fatal coronavirus outbreak, that originated in China, the content of this book hits a tune little too close.

What is eerie about this whole scenario is the way Dean speaks about a virus called the Wuhan 400. Here are lines from the book, which have made this book an instant sensation.

Dean writes: To understand that,”Dombey said, “you have to go back twenty months. It was around then that a Chinese scientist named Li Chen defected to the United States, carrying a diskette record of China’s most important and dangerous new biological weapon in a decade. They call the stuff “Wuhan-400” because it was developed at their RDNA labs outside of the city Wuhan and it was the Four-hundredth visible strain of man-made microorganism…..

Somewhere in the chapter it also mentions that only human can carry this virus and that the moment a person dies the virus dies within a few minutes

Here two facts are clear:

1) Wuhan has always been the epicenter of virus testing in its virology center: and

2) China has always been tangled in the controversies of developing biological weapons

Twitter has been flooded with people calling this book a little too close to reality. However, it must be remembered that coincidences are a part and parcel of life.

The coronavirus now named COVID-19 has created havoc. With more than 1500 people dead in China alone, the fatality rate does not seem to be stopping soon.

The latest on this front is recovered patients donating blood for their plasma to be used as a treatment in the most severe cases. The Chinese are currently trying every permeation and combination possible. Some of the hospitals in Wuhan tried 100-year-old Chinese medicines along with the western treatments. Some people responded positively to this too.

In the meanwhile, the world is rallying together to fight this menace. The World Health Organization has recently sent a 12 member team of experts to China to help the Chinese researchers and scientists to understand the virus and collectively take action. Operating from ground zero will help the teams to respond to global needs better.
