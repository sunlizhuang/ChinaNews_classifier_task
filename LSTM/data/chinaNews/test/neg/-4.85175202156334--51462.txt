Viral Observing governments of all sizes and capabilities react to the challenges posed by the 2019-nCoV outbreak that had just recently been declared by the World Health Organization as a global health crisis, was probably one of the top activities last week when the outbreak became a cause of major concern for almost everyone in the planet. Some governments reacted quickly, banning flights from infected areas and repatriating affected citizens into quarantine camps. Others stood by and watched the situation unfold, opting to do nothing like deer caught in headlights. The Philippines last week belonged to the latter group of countries whose leaders did nothing of significance while a global health crisis was raging. First of all, we couldn’t even confirm suspected cases of 2019-nCoV in the country because our third world and underfunded health system lacked the medical laboratories, equipment and personnel to test and analyze samples taken from patients. Filipinos had to wait for samples to be sent to Australia for confirmation of tests. That is why we enjoyed a one week buffer from infection, when there were zero confirmed cases in the Philippines. Our government and health officials may have enjoyed that respite because no confirmed cases meant they didn’t have to make difficult decisions that could affect the health and welfare of a hundred million people but what was flabbergasting was, despite that one week spent buffering their brains, it seemed like nobody spent that extra week to come up with a plan for this country that is right beside ground zero and chock full of visitors from mainland China. Our leaders had one week to discuss the merits of a travel ban on China and act. It was the biggest and most substantial course of action available. Even if a ban was not a surefire way to stop the spread of the disease, it could’ve assured our people that their government acknowledges the threat and is doing something. But our officials had to wait until the results came back from Australia before begrudgingly declaring a partial travel ban, and then wait for another confirmation that the singular coronavirus-related death outside China is in our country, before expanding that ban. A classic case of the following idioms: Too little too late, and locking the stables after the horses have bolted. Lab tests have confirmed that the virus is already here and it has killed. The travel ban that could’ve helped one week ago by preventing potential carriers from entering is nothing but a PR stunt at this point. Maybe our top officials should just pull out all the stops and welcome the virus with a tête-à-tête. Unlike his other ka-tete, the virus will probably show up and not leave Mr. Panelo hanging by his lonesome. Why was a travel ban so difficult to decide in the face of what would be designated by the World Health Organization a global health crisis? Some are surmising that our officials didn’t want to offend our dear friend China, the undisputed source of the virus, with a travel ban. If you come to think of it, why should we worry about offending China if our leaders’ policies and position had already surrendered/gifted them with a huge chunk of our national territory in the past couple of years?This was a relationship where we were the ones who gave up territory, giant clams, and fishing grounds and all we got in return were a couple of dubious loans and a corona virus infection. It is looking more and more like we got the raw end of whatever deal our representatives made in our behalf. After all we have given up, they shouldn’t be easily offended. Government had at least one week to prepare for the inevitable but when it came, it turns out there aren’t enough face masks for health workers and the public. Instead of preparing for ourselves, we even exported a couple million masks to China as a gesture of goodwill and solidarity. Perhaps our government officials thought that the virus would be afraid of their boss who can threaten an active volcano with piss and false teeth and has powerful friends such as an appointed son of God who claims to possess the ability to command an earthquake to stop shaking. While I subscribe to the school of thought that masks are not that useful against the virus, it has become apparent that surgical and N95 masks give a lot a people a sense of security. As the eminent provider of security, government should’ve prepared for it by having masks in stock or working with the private sector to ensure a steady supply of masks. Instead, nothing was done so all they can do now is to plead with the public not to wear masks amid the short supply so medical practitioners will not run out of masks. No matter how you look at it, running out of something as basic as surgical masks during an epidemic is a sign of horribly poor preparation. Is someone sleeping on the job? But don’t worry guys, almost a week after the coronavirus was confirmed in the country, a Cabinet meeting will be held and that should solve everything. No need to panic because our government isn’t panicking in the first place. The coronavirus outbreak is but one of the many serious matters the brave and busy men in power must face, such as the grave insult against our people that is the canceled US visa of Senator Bato and of course, always and forever… drugs. This country has many problems. Not just drugs, canceled US Visas and the coronavirus. However, there are some issues that require more attention than others, and based on the growing sentiment regarding government’s sloppy reaction, 2019-nCoV is turning out to be one of those things. The coronavirus won’t wipe out our population. Because we have modern medicine on our side, it can’t kill more people than a merciless and indiscriminate drug war that, according to the statistics, targets the poor and defenseless more than big fish. Unless someone truly messes up, I don’t think it can kill more people than SAF44 here in the Philippines. But if government doesn’t do enough to assure Filipinos that competent people are in charge, and that the days of bumbling around are over, this virus could do more damage than expected, and that is why I think our leaders will find a way to somehow right the ship. Lives matter, but it’s different when their political survival is at stake.* Follow on Twitter: @bindadu
