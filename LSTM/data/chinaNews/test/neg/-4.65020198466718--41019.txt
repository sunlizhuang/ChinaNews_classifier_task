What is our world going to look like in a few months if the number of coronavirus cases continues to grow at this rate? On January 17th, there were 41 confirmed cases, and now there are 9,692 in China alone. That means that the number of confirmed cases is 236 times larger than it was just 2 weeks ago. I don’t expect the number of cases to be another 236 times larger two weeks from now, but even if the number of cases simply doubles each week, hundreds of millions of people will eventually get this virus. And that would mean that millions upon millions of people would end up dead. Let us pray that such a scenario does not materialize, but at this point it has become exceedingly clear that we are dealing with a very serious health crisis.

Here in the United States, there has only been a handful of confirmed cases so far. But we did just have our first confirmed case of “person-to-person transmission” inside this country…

The first case of person-to-person transmission in the U.S. is the husband of a Chicago woman who developed symptoms after visiting China. The woman, who is in her 60s, was hospitalized after being diagnosed with the illness following her return from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the virus outbreak, on Jan. 13. She and her husband, who did not join her on the trip, are hospitalized.

The best way to avoid getting this virus is to avoid anyone that has it.

Unfortunately, it is incredibly difficult to determine who may be carrying it.

As I have discussed previously, the incubation period for this virus can be as long as two weeks. That means that someone can be carrying the virus for two weeks without even showing any symptoms.

And it is not necessary to be showing any symptoms in order to spread the virus to other people. The following comes from Natural News…

All the “experts” are missing a fatal truth about the coronavirus pandemic: It spreads from people who show no symptoms. Because they show no symptoms, they evade all existing screening efforts such as thermal scanning for fevers and self-reporting of symptoms to health authorities. In other words, many people who are infected with the coronavirus and are spreading it have no idea they are infected.

This is a perfect virus for a global pandemic. It jumps from person to person very, very easily, and the vast majority of those that get the virus are not even going to realize that they are infected until much later.

Meanwhile, they are spreading the virus to countless others.

At this point, we really have no idea how many victims are carrying this virus. There could literally be thousands upon thousands of people spreading this virus around the United States right now, and we don’t really have any way to determine who they are until they start exhibiting symptoms.

Because of the ease with which this virus spreads, Bianco Research is projecting that we could potentially see 183 million cases by the end of February…

A model that predicts the number of coronavirus infections that will occur if the outbreak isn’t contained shows that based on current projections, there will be over 183 million infections before the end of February. The chart, produced by data firm Bianco Research, shows that if the current rate of infections remains consistent, 183,943,221 people will have been infected by the virus within the next three weeks.

Personally, I don’t think we will be anywhere near that number.

But what if we get to the end of February and there are half a million cases worldwide and the virus continues to spread like wildfire?

Without a doubt, that would make it the worst global pandemic in more than 100 years.

Fortunately, the Trump administration has decided to take action. The State Department is now specifically telling people not to travel to China…

A new State Department travel advisory raised the warning for China to the same level as Iraq and Afghanistan. In a notice posted on its website, the department said: “Do not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China.”

But that warning may have come too late, because “suspected cases” of the virus are already popping up all across America.

We better hope that authorities can get this virus under control in this country. Videos of people literally collapsing in the streets have caused a tremendous amount of panic in China, and if the same thing starts happening in the United States it will create a social media firestorm. There will be panic on a massive scale, and people will become very desperate.

Let me give you an example of the fear that we are already starting to see around the world. In Australia, bystanders were so afraid of getting the coronavirus that they literally refused to perform CPR on a Chinese man that collapsed to the ground from a heart attack…

TERRIFIED bystanders refused to step in and perform CPR on a Chinese man who suffered a heart attack in Sydney, for fear of contracting coronavirus. The 60-year-old man fell to the ground after suffering a cardiac arrest outside a restaurant in the city’s Chinatown. Restaurant managers said they were alerted to the incident on Tuesday night by passersby. The tragedy comes as Australia’s government defended its plan to quarantine up to 600 evacuated citizens on Christmas Island.

Of course he didn’t actually have the virus. He was just having heart problems.

If we are seeing this level of fear when the number of cases outside of China is still relatively low, what will things look like when the number of worldwide cases reaches a million?

Our society is already coming apart at the seams, and this crisis definitely has the potential to greatly accelerate that process.

When push comes to shove, most people would be willing to do just about anything to stay alive.

And once people start dropping dead from this virus in major cities all over the nation, the desperation will be off the charts.

So let us pray that this pandemic is brought to an end somehow.

Unfortunately, right now the number of cases continues to grow at an exponential rate, and the outlook for the months ahead is becoming increasingly grim.
