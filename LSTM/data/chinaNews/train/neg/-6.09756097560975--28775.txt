The State Department advised against travel to China amid an outbreak of a deadly coronavirus.

The travel advisory, issued Monday, said Americans should “reconsider travel” to anywhere in China. It also issued a “do not travel” advisory to Hubei province, which has been at the center of the coronavirus outbreak.

“Travelers should be aware that the Chinese government could prevent them from entering or exiting parts of Hubei province. Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice,” the statement said.

At least 80 people have died from the mystery virus, and nearly 3,000 people have contracted the infection as of Monday. Five cases have been reported in the United States, though there have not yet been any deaths from the virus reported outside China.

The U.S. Consulate in Wuhan is chartering a private flight on Tuesday to evacuate personnel and private American citizens.
