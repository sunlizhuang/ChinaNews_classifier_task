A second student at Smith College is under medical evaluation for possible exposure to coronavirus.

The school shared in a letter with the campus community Tuesday that the student recently traveled to the Hubei province in China and has reported cold-like symptoms.

She was taken to an area hospital for evaluation of her symptoms and will be in isolation for several days in compliance with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“At this time, under CDC and DPH guidance, there is no identified risk to the Smith community,” states the letter to the campus community, shared by Susan Etheredge, dean of the college, and college physician Tara Dumont.

The college notified the campus community on Sunday of another student experiencing cold-like symptoms who arrived at Boston Logan International Airport on the same flight as the University of Massachusetts Boston student who was diagnosed with coronavirus. The Smith student left voluntary isolation after determined to be symptom-free.

The UMass student, a man in his 20s, recognized he was sick and was diagnosed with the virus, named 2019-nCoV. He has been quarantined in his off-campus home since Wednesday and is being monitored regularly by nurses over the phone, according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

Several Massachusetts schools have suspended school-related travel to China, including Boston University, Harvard University and UMass Amherst. At Northeastern University, students traveling to China via university sponsorship will now need approval to do so from the Office of the Provost.
