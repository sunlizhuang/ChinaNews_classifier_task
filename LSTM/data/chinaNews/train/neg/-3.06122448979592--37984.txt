BELLINGHAM, Wash. â€” Whatcom County tested a patient for coronavirus.

County Health Department spokesperson Melissa Morin tells KGMI the test came back negative.

She says the department is following guidelines from the CDC to determine who to test for the deadly virus.

Patients who show symptoms and have either traveled to Wuhan, China in the last two weeks or have been in close contact with a confirmed case will be tested.

Morin says they will issue a news release if health officials confirm a case of coronavirus in Whatcom County.
