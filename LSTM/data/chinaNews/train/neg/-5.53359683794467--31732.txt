Two adults who recently returned to Broome County from separate travel to China have tested negative for coronavirus, after getting treatment for respiratory symptoms.

Both patients were evaluated at local medical facilities for respiratory symptoms, and tests were performed at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia, the Broome County Health Department said Monday afternoon.

The Health Department announced Tuesday morning that results were negative in both patients.

"There are currently no other people in Broome County under testing, nor any confirmed cases," the Health Department said Tuesday.

A total of nine cases in New York have been investigated for coronavirus, including four that have been proven negative, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

On Monday, China's death toll from the new coronavirus had reached 81, and confirmed cases across the nation ballooned to more than 2,700.

More than 40 cases have been confirmed in a dozen other countries, including five in the U.S., in the states of California, Illinois, Arizona and Washington.

"All US cases traveled from Wuhan, China," the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. "More cases may be identified. However, risk to US general public is still considered low."
