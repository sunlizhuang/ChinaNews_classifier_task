The death toll from theoutbreak surged past 1,000 in China on Tuesday as the World Healthwarned that the epidemic poses a “very grave” global threat.The WHO is holding a conference in Geneva on combatting the virus as Beijing struggles to contain a disease that has now infected more than 42,000 and reached some 25 countries. Another 108 deaths were reported on Tuesday – the first triple-digit daily rise since the virus emerged in late December.Chinese Presidentsaid on Tuesday that China's prevention and control work on the new coronavirus is having positive results, and the country will win the battle against the virus, state media reported.“With 99 per cent of cases in China, this remains very much an emergency for that country, but one that holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world,” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.The death toll has now reached 1,016, although the mortality rate remains relatively low at 2.4 per cent.But the case of a British man who passed on the virus to at least 11other people – without having been in China -- has raised fears of a new phase of contagion abroad.The 53-year-old – dubbed a “superspreader” by some British media, said on Tuesday he had fully recovered, but remained in isolation in a central London hospital.Most cases overseas have involved people who had been in Wuhan, the quarantined central Chinese city where the virus emerged late last year, or people infected by others who had been at the epicentre. But the Briton caught the virus while attending a conference inand then passed it on to several compatriots while on holiday in the French Alps, before finally being diagnosed back in Britain. “The detection of this small number of cases could be the spark that becomes a bigger fire,” Tedros said on Monday, urging countries to seize on the “window of opportunity” to prevent a bigger outbreak.The biggest cluster of cases outside China is aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship moored off Japan, where 135 people have been positively diagnosed.Thai health authorities have barred a cruise ship from docking that has already been turned away by the Philippines, Taiwan and Japan out of concern over a new virus, although no cases have been confirmed on board.More than 100 people were evacuated from a 35-storey Hong Kong housing block Tuesday after two residents in different apartments tested positive for the virus. Residents were forced to leave as health officials in masks and white overalls scrambled to work out whether the virus had spread through the complex of some 3,000 people. “Of course I’m scared,” a 59-year-old resident said.Chinese authorities, meanwhile, dismissed two senior health officials from Hubei, the central province where some 56 million people, including in its capital Wuhan, have been under lockdown since late last month.China’s coronavirus outbreak may peak soon, a prominent Chinese expert said on Tuesday. The government’s top medical adviser on the outbreak, Zhong Nanshan, held out hope that the epidemic may peak in February and then plateau before easing. “The peak time may be reached at the ... middle or late this month,” Zhong, an epidemiologist who won fame for his role in combating an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003, said. The number of new cases was already declining in some provinces, he added.
