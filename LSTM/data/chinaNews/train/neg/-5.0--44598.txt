More than 200 vehicles ordered off capital's roads over emissions

More than 200 vehicles were ordered off the roads in Bangkok last month for belching excessive amounts of black smoke into the air, according to the Metropolitan Police Bureau (MPB).

The bureau said traffic police conducted checks on city roads and found more than 11,119 vehicles emitting black smoke. Of that number, more than 7,400 were trucks.

Most of the owners were fined and told to have repairs made to their vehicles.

The bureau also came across 225 vehicles which emitted excessive exhaust smoke. These vehicles were ordered off the road pending maintenance to resolve the issue.

MPB deputy commissioner Pol Maj Gen Jirasan Kaewsaeng-ek said the bureau has launched a campaign on how to stay safe from dust pollution at offices and schools.

The bureau has also sought cooperation from public transport agencies and department stores to reduce dust.

Meanwhile, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) has asked Chinese Buddhist temples on Yaowarat road, which is Bangkok's main ethnic Chinese community, to cut down on burning ceremonial papers and lighting incense sticks to ease the fine dust problem.

Chatree Wattanakechorn, director of the BMA's Environment Department, said PM2.5 levels above the safe threshold were often recorded around Wat Mangkon Kamalawat.

He said the BMA has now asked the Chinese Buddhist temples and shrines in the Yaowarat area to reduce smoke-emitting activities.

Yutthana Pamai, director of Pom Prap Sattru Phai district, said Wat Mangkon Kamalawat has responded by moving the incense pots to outside areas for better ventilation and prohibited the burning of paper.
