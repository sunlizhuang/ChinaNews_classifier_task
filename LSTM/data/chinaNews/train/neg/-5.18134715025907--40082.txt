CLEVELAND, Ohio — The expanding coronavirus is upending the travel industry, forcing cancellations, closures and warnings here and abroad.

Numerous airlines, including United, American and British Airways, are canceling some or all flights into and out of China temporarily, while others, including Delta, are waiving fees for travelers who want to postpone trips.

Meanwhile, the State Department recently updated a travel advisory to include all of China, elevating the warning to a level 3 out of 4, urging travelers to reconsider travel to the country. Said the department: “Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice.” The epicenter of the infection, Hubei Province, has been elevated to a “do not travel” level 4 by the State Department.

Officials are screening arriving passengers for the virus at 20 U.S. international airports, including Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Atlanta and others.

Several cruise lines, including Royal Caribbean, Costa and MSC, have canceled cruises and ports of call in China, and numerous tourist attractions in China — including the Forbidden City, parts of the Great Wall of China and Shanghai Disney are all closed.
