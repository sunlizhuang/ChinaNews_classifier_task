Indonesia got its first scare of the contagious Chinese coronavirus this afternoon, which led to the lockdown of an office building in the capital Jakarta.

As reported by Tempo, an employee of Huawei Tech Investment, who had recently returned from a trip to China, was suspected of exhibiting fever symptoms associated with the deadly disease. Huawei Tech Investment has an office in the BRI II tower in Bendungan Hilir, Central Jakarta.

The office tower was put under containment lockdown, with employees being prohibited to leave the building and handed face masks this afternoon.

According to a statement by BRI received by Coconuts, the employee was taken to the nearest hospital where he was diagnosed with laryngitis.

There has been no statement yet from the government confirming BRI’s statement. We’ll update this developing story as more information becomes available.

Seventeen people have now died from the SARS-like disease in China’s Hubei province, a month since the virus was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

The number of confirmed cases in China has also soared past 500, the country’s National Health Commission announced today, as it puts Wuhan on lockdown starting today, shutting outbound flights and train services for the city in an attempt to contain the spread of the disease.

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, also known as the 2019-nCoV, was first reported in December and has been linked to a now-closed seafood market there. Within weeks, it spread to other parts of China, including Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.
