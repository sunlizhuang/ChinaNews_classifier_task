SAO PAULO, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Brazilian soy exports to China may drop 15% this year due to greater U.S. competition and a likely slowdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak, according to analysts at Dutch bank Rabobank on Thursday.

Rabobank analysts Victor Ikeda and Lief Chiang told Reuters China would import from Brazil this year around 45 million tonnes of soy, down from 53 million tonnes last year.

The analysts said increased competition from U.S. soy producers is expected to account for most of the exports reduction after the U.S.-China trade deal. "The coronavirus outbreak effects will be felt on the shorter term", said Ikeda, senior analyst at Brazil's Rabobank subsidiary.

China may increase its global soy imports by 5% this year, analysts said. Last year, the country bought 88.5 million tonnes of soy, 0.57% more than the previous year, according to Chinese official data. (Reporting by Roberto Samora; Editing by Richard Chang)
