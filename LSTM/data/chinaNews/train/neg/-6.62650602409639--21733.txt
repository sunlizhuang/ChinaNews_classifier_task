During Thursday's impeachment proceedings, House managers made their case before the Senate that President Trump's conduct amounted to abuse of power. The managers argued that when it came to Ukraine, Trump didn't care about corruption — he just wanted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. In his closing statement, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said Trump "violated the Constitution," and "if the truth doesn't matter, we're lost. The framers couldn't protect us from ourselves if right and truth don't matter. But here, right is supposed to matter. It's what made us the greatest nation on earth. No Constitution can protect us if right doesn't matter any more."
