Doctors in Germany, Japan, and Vietnam have confirmed their first cases of coronavirus in patients who have not traveled to Wuhan, China, the epicenter of what Chinese President Xi Jinping has called a "demon" epidemic.

A 33-year-old man contracted the virus in Germany after meeting with a female colleague who recently traveled to China. The Bavarian Health Ministry reported that the man is in "good condition," but doctors are concerned that the woman from whom he contracted the virus showed no symptoms of carrying the disease, according to the Guardian.

A spokeswoman from the Robert Koch Institute, a German center for disease prevention, told Agence France-Presse it is the first "human-to-human transmission" in Europe.

The virus has spread rapidly across China, killing 106 and infecting more than 4,000. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is monitoring at least 110 people for the disease.

Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato confirmed that a man who drove tourists from Wuhan contracted the virus without visiting China.

"One of them has no record of visiting Wuhan and drove tourists from Wuhan on a bus twice in January," said Kato.

Japan has announced six cases of coronavirus and plans to evacuate more than 200 citizens from Wuhan today.
