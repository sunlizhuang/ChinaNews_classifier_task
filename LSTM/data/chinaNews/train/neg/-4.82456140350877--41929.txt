MINNEAPOLIS — The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities has suspended all student travel and education abroad programs in China for the Spring 2020 semester amid the Coronavirus outbreak there. The decision comes after the outbreak was declared a "public health emergency" by the World Health Organization — only the sixth time the WHO has declared such an emergency.

Additionally, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has asked citizens to avoid all nonessential travel to China. Delta and American other airlines have also suspended travel to China.

"The health and wellbeing of the U of M community is paramount," the university said Thursday.

"With this in mind, we are continuing to monitor the 2019 Novel Coronavirus and implement precautions as necessary."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is closely monitoring an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Chinese authorities are working to contain the new coronavirus, which has resulted in more than 7,800 confirmed cases in China, including outside of Wuhan City.

Additional cases have been identified in a growing number of other international locations, including the United States.

As of Friday, there have been six confirmed cases of the virus in the United States in Washington state, California, Arizona and Illinois, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
