Dozens gathered at the Landmark mall in Central during lunch time today, demanding the government seal the land borders with the mainland immediately contain the coronavirus outbreak originating in Wuhan, RTHK reports.

Along with the familiar slogans like “five demands, not one less,” they also chanted “close the border, say no to China.”

Many masked protesters were wearing white ribbons to show support for the medics, saying they could get infected with the coronavirus and die sooner or later, if the borders are not fully closed.

One participant, Fai, blamed the government for the strike by the medical workers.

"But the government is putting them at unnecessary risk," said Fai. He admitted that hospital service have been affected by the strike, but said the blame should rest on the government officials.
