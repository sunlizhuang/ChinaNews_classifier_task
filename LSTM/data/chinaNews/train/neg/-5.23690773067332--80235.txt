Chilean peso plummets to over 800 per dollar

20 de febrero de 2020, 16:25Santiago de Chile, Feb 20 (Prensa Latina) The Chilean pesos on Thursday dropped for the fourth consecutive day as much as 807 against the US dollar.

The significant loss of eight pesos was due to the concerns about the development of the Chilean economy in this year as well as the Covid-19 outbreak, and brought the Chilean pesos to its lowest level since November 29, 2019, as it was quoted at 810 per US dollar.The market analyst Ricardo Bustamante reported that the strong rally of the US dollar on Thursday was influenced by a report from the Chamber of Commerce of Santiago, which forecast a poor outlook for the domestic economy in 2020.Bustamante also said that a new copper price falling-off was also affected due to concerns about the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak impact on China's economy, the world's largest consumer of refined copper.Likewise, he warned that whether other aftermaths are reported nationwide in the coming days and concerns about Covid-19 increase, the US dollar could exceed the exchange rate of 810 Chilean pesos in the next few days.rly/pll/mgt/rc
