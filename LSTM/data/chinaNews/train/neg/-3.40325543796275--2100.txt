Realme released its first 5G mobile phone, Realme X50 in Beijing. In addition, the company also announced its development goals and future development priorities for 2020. Realme CMO, Xu Qi, said in an interview that Realme’s goal is to become a global TOP-level mobile phone brand. At present, the Realme brand is only 18 months old, and it is seventh globally in terms of market share globally.

Realme TV category to arrive this year

Earlier, it was rumored that Realme will launch a smart TV at the end of 2019. Although there are some issues to tackle, Xu Qi, says that Realme will definitely launch its TV category in 2020. The specific business model and back-end supply chain issues are still in the exploration stage, and there is no absolute conclusion. In addition to Realme TV, the company will also enter the IoT field. Li Bingzhong said that Realme will launch more comprehensive IoT products around personal, family and travel scenarios. These will include audio products, wearable devices, TVs, and other devices.

At the end of last year, Realme set its goals for 2020. The company believes that it can maintain its growth of more than 100% globally. This means that in 2020, Realme’s mobile phone sales will exceed 50 million.

How to achieve such high growth? Xu Qi pinned his hopes on “5G” and “AIoT”, and this has become the focus of realme’s future development.

In terms of 5G, Xu Qi said that Realme will fully cut into 5G products in China in 2020, and will no longer launch 4G products.

“This seems to be a very radical decision, but for Realme, this decision is not too difficult because Realme is very young, we can almost say that it is the lightest 5G player currently burdened.” Xu Qi said.

He revealed that Realme will achieve full coverage of 5G this year. In addition, Realme will launch 5G mobile phone products with a price range of 1500 ($216) – 2000 yuan ($288) this year.
