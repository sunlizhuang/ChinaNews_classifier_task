"These droplets will not land further than about three feet from where the person is, so therefore, there are several hundreds of feet between where medical centre is and where these persons will be quarantined; several hundreds of feet between where those persons are and where the roadway is; several hundreds of feet between where those persons are and where other houses and business places are. We do not perceive a risk to the surrounding community," she insisted.

She explained that the coronavirus is transmitted by droplets that come as persons cough or sneeze.

New coronovirus cases in France, UK

Meanwhile, World Health Organization (WHO) officials are concerned about new coronavirus cases confirmed in France and the U.K. that were transmitted without any travel history to China.

Health authorities reported that five British citizens contracted the virus in a town in France.

The U.K. on Monday confirmed new cases linked to a British man who went a conference in Singapore.

WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus on Monday told reporters at the organization's headquarters in Geneva that the small number of cases could rise.

World health officials said the respiratory disease, which has sickened more than 40,000 people worldwide and killed at least 910, mostly in China, is capable of spreading through human-to-human contact, droplets carried through sneezing and coughing, and germs left on inanimate objects.

Symptoms can include a sore throat, runny nose, fever or pneumonia and can progress to multiple organ failure or death in some severe cases.
