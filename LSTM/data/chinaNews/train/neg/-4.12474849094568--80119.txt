Those days are now gone. In the past few years, dozens of Chinese professors have been silenced, arrested or exiled because of their criticism of the Chinese government, including my wife’s constitutional law professor at Tsinghua Law School, Xu Zhangrun. What’s more tragic is that some of the professors were reported to the police by their own students. This would have been unimaginable when I was in college, when students like me were eager to learn about the professors’ insights on different political and legal systems, which unavoidably included criticisms of the systems, including that of China. We all then understood the intention behind these discussions was to make our society a better one for ordinary Chinese people.
