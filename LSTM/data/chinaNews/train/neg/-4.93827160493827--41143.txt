The Ministry of Health, which is in charge of coronavirus control and prevention, has advised that people who suspect they may have been exposed to the virus should call an ambulance (112) rather than go or drive to a hospital themselves.

Lina Bušinskaitė-Šriubienė, an adviser to the minister of health, says that about ten people have contacted Lithuanian healthcare institutions about suspected infections since last Sunday. None of the cases proved to be coronavirus.

The coronavirus outbreak originated in the Hubei province of China in late December. As of Friday, 16 coronavirus cases have been diagnosed in Europe: in Germany, France, Italy, Finland and the UK.

At least 213 people have died from coronavirus and more than 9,709 cases have been confirmed in mainland China, as the virus spreads globally.
