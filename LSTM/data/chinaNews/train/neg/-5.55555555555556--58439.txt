The death toll in mainland China¬ís new virus outbreak has risen to 636, including a doctor who got in trouble with authorities in the communist country for sounding an early warning about the disease threat.

Two docked cruise ships with thousands of passengers and crew members remained under 14-day quarantines in Hong Kong and Japan.

Before Friday¬ís 41 confirmed cases, 20 passengers who were found to have the virus were escorted off the Diamond Princess at Yokohama near Tokyo.

I‚Äôve wondered if, since china knows it‚Äôs going down for the count with this one, they‚Äôre deliberately seeding it everywhere they can. Make everyone suffer as well.

That problem was at least easy to quarantine. This one has the makings of a Stephen King novel.

I think its the food or air vents or housekeeping.

I believe this is the ship that had one (1)!!! Wuhan citizen, age 80, and he infected at least 61 so far (61 out of 271 tested)

No he never returned and his fate is still unlearned

He may ride forever ‚Äòneath the streets of Boston

And he‚Äôs the man who never returned

Maybe there was someone else who was asymptomatic. Even with that Katy bar the door.

People have cell phones everywhere, especially in the crapper. People put cell phones on counters, tables, etc. Easier to spread junk around. Charging centers are now a nexus of spreading $hit. Same with airport charging spots.

Like living on a floating Petri dish. Bring Out Your Dead Post to me or FReep mail to be on/off the Bring Out Your Dead ping list. The purpose of the ¬ìBring Out Your Dead¬î ping list (formerly the ¬ìEbola¬î ping list) is very early warning of emerging pandemics, as such it has a high false positive rate. So far the false positive rate is 100%. At some point we may well have a high mortality pandemic, and likely as not the ¬ìBring Out Your Dead¬î threads will miss the beginning entirely. *sigh* Such is life, and death... If a quarantine saves just one child's life, it's worth it.
