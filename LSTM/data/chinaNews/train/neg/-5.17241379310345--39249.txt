The government of The Bahamas has implemented a travel ban restricting all travel from China to The Bahamas, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Pearl McMillan announced today.

This follows a recent outbreak of the deadly 2019 novel coronavirus.

“Effective immediately, any non-resident, regardless of nationality, who has visited China in the last 20 days will be denied entry into the country,” she said during a press conference at the Ministry of Health.

“All residents returning to The Bahamas will be strictly quarantined and monitored for the duration of the incubation period, which is a maximum of 14 days.”

This comes after The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new coronavirus a global public health emergency.

Health Minister Dr. Duane Sands said there haven’t been any cases of the virus in The Bahamas.

He said two people attempting to enter The Bahamas have been quarantined.

The virus, which was first identified in Wuhan, China, has since spread to multiple countries. At least 170 people have died as a result of the virus.
