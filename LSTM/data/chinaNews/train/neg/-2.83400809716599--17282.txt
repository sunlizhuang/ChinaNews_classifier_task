WELLINGTON, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese tourists are warned of road safety in New Zealand after a bus rolled on Tuesday in South Island, which caused multiple injuries, the Chinese Embassy in New Zealand said on Wednesday.

The Chinese Embassy published the message on its website, warning Chinese citizens in New Zealand to raise safety awareness and be cautious so as to avoid road accidents.

"Safety notices for Chinese citizens travelling in New Zealand during Chinese New Year holidays have been published both online and via social media WeChat. Chinese citizens, regardless of tourists, students or workers who reside in New Zealand should be cautious about road safety and avoid road accidents," the statement read.

The warning message came at the Chinese New Year occasion when an increasing number of Chinese tourists travel to New Zealand.

"Remember to stay focused while driving, keep in mind to drive by the left, abide by the local traffic rules, wear seatbelts and install baby seats for under aged children," warned the Chinese Embassy in the statement.

Consulate protection contact numbers were also provided in the warning message.

On Tuesday, a bus rolled on a scenic road between Glenorchy and Queenstown, in South Island. About 20 Chinese tourists were injured, among whom two were under serious conditions.

The two seriously injured people have been sent to hospital. Ambulance, rescue helicopters and police cars rushed to the scene and the road was blocked.
