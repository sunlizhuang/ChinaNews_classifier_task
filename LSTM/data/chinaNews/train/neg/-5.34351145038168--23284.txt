Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced four people have been isolated and are being tested for the "rapidly spreading" coronavirus.

"The State Department of Health currently has four persons under investigation for novel coronavirus that are under isolation as their cases are being tested at the CDC," Cuomo wrote in a statement. "So far, one of these cases has been proven negative, and three are still pending. While the risk for New York is currently low, the governor is calling for increased vigilance to ensure New Yorkers are protected."

New York State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker told residents who have recently traveled to Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, to visit their local physician.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that people should not worry about the outbreak, though it is testing 63 patients for the virus as of Friday. A man in Washington state was confirmed carrying the virus, and a second person, a woman in Chicago, has been isolated after testing positive for the pathogen.

“We are undertaking a wide-reaching and rigorous effort with all stakeholders, including healthcare providers, airports, and federal health officials, to put in place the appropriate precautions to keep New Yorkers safe,” said Cuomo.

China restricted travel to more than 33 million citizens as the virus spreads through the Asian nation. Though officials say symptoms are similar to pneumonia, videos have allegedly shown infected people collapsing on the street, bleeding from their mouths, and being treated by doctors wearing hazmat suits.
