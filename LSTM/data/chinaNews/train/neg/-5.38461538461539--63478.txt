The Northern Marianas has implemented austerity measures as the territory looks to be hard-hit by the loss of Chinese tourism.

Governor Ralph Torres said the territory stood to lose as many as 40,000 Chinese tourists this financial year, as a result of the coronavirus lockdown.

The government estimates the territory could lose as much as $US48 million in revenue.

Mr Torres announced on Saturday that a 64-hour work week would be implemented for the public service, with departments and agencies closing on Fridays from 20 March.

"The territory continues to reel from supertyphoon Yutu in 2018, and the suspension of flights from China has dealt another blow," according to the governor.
