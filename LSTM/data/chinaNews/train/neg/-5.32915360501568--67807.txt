New case confirmed in the U.S. - NBC News' Tracie Potts reports

SAN DIEGO, Calif. (KYMA, KECY/NBC News) - The first federal quarantine in 50-years ended Tuesday with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) trying to reassure Americans what's happening in China is not happening here.

More than a thousand are now dead of coronavirus in China.

"This outbreak is spreading much more quickly than SARS did." said Dr. Anne Schuchat, Principal Deputy Director of the CDC.

The CDC reports 13 mild cases here in the U.S., including one just diagnosed in San Diego.

"The US situation is very different than what we're seeing in China/ We do not have widespread transmission." said Dr. Schuchat.

195 people who were on the first flight out of Wuhan are expected to be released from quarantine Tuesday with no symptoms.

But there are still 20 Americans stuck in this cruise ship outside Japan, where passengers have fallen sick.

President Donald Trump addressed the situation while in New Hampshire Monday night.

"I spoke with President Xi and they're working very, very hard, and I think it's going to all work out fine. Rough stuff I tell you, rough, rough stuff. "

Rough, and costly. Lawmakers are questioning why the administration's not asking for emergency funds while pitching a $35-million cut to the CDC's budget.

"This the fund that's currently being used to respond to the coronavirus outbreak." said Senator Chuck Schumer, (D) New York.

300 scientists, on a call today with the World Health Organization (WHO), want to fast-track tests, drugs and vaccines.

"There is still so much we don't know." said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the organization's director-general.

And still so many waiting to be told they're not sick.

On Tuesday, Illinois became the first state to start doing its own testing. It has a 24-hour turnaround and doctors don't have to wait for results from the CDC.
