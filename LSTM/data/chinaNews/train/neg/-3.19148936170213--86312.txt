PARIS — As the coronavirus continues to wreak havoc across the world, SMCP, the group that owns Sandro, Maje and Claudie Pierlot, said the outbreak is significantly impacting sales and profitability in China — a key market for its contemporary French fashion labels — and weighing on other regions as well, due to the decline in Chinese tourists.

Since late January, SMCP has temporarily closed a large proportion of its stores in mainland China and Macau, with limited opening hours for boutiques that are open.
