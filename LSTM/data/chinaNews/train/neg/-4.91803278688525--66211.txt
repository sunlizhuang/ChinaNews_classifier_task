Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, February, 11) â€” Three airlines have canceled flights between Philippines and Taiwan amid the expanded travel ban imposed by the Philippine government to stop the spread of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific on Monday said the flights to and from Taipei are suspended immediately and indefinitely. This comes hours after the Health Department said Taiwan is included in the travel ban imposed on China, Hong Kong, and Macau.

AirAsia on Tuesday said all flights between Philippines and Taipei and Kaohsiung have been canceled until further notice from the government.

The following flights have been canceled:

- PAL: PR890/891 Manila-Taipei-Manila and PR894/895 Manila-Taipei-Manila

- Cebu Pacific: 5J 312/5J 310 Manila-Taipei, 5J 313/5J 311 (starting February 12) Taipei-Manila

Affected passengers can have their tickets refunded and their refund fees waived.

President Rodrigo Duterte on February 2 temporarily banned the entry of foreign nationals coming directly from China, Hong Kong, Macau or those with travel history to those areas in the last 14 days. The restrictions only apply to incoming foreign travelers, and not Filipino citizens and holders of permanent resident-visas issued by the Philippines. The inclusion of Taiwan in the travel ban means travel is also restricted for Filipinos going to the self-administered island that China considers as its province.

The Health Department on Monday clarified Taiwan is included in the temporary travel ban imposed by the Philippines. Health spokesperson Eric Domingo said this is because Taiwan is considered by the World Health Organization as part of China.
