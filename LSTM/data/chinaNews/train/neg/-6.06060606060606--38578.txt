Health officials world-wide are scrambling to contain coronavirus, emanating from Wuhan, China, which has been quarantined by the government, reportedly after millions of people have already left.

Now attempts to be politically correct are the cause of silly anti-racist policies which can lead to the spread of the virus.

The policy of the York School Board, north of Toronto, with a large Asian population, has been essentially to ”do nothing” — even though many students are now returning to school from holiday trips to Wuhan.

The school officials say they are concerned that any action will invite racism — my contention is that to not honestly deal with people of all ethnicities who may have been infected is to invite racism because every person of Asian descent will be suspected, without any basis. Now that is racism.

To test those who may have been exposed is not racist-it is only a matter of common sense.

Every person of whatever ethnicity or nationality — Chinese or Finnish or French, everyone — should be tested if they are travelling to Canada from an area which has been infected.
