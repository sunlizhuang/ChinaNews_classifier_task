Crown Resorts employees who were arrested and charged with gambling-related crimes in China will not be able to assist shareholders in preparing a class action lawsuit against the Australian casino giant over the affair, a court has ruled.

Nineteen Crown employees were arrested in co-ordinated raids across several Chinese cities in October 2016 and were charged with promoting gambling in the country. The shock arrests saw Crown's share price dive almost 14 per cent, wiping more than $1.3 billion from the company's market value.

The shareholder class action, run by plaintiff law firm Maurice Blackburn, is seeking compensation for the value investors lost when the shares crashed, and argues Crown did not tell shareholders about the risks it was taking in China.

The Full Court of the Federal Court on Wednesday unanimously overturned an earlier decision to void confidentiality contracts between Crown and the 19 employees.
