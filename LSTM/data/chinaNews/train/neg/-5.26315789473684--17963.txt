Wuhan, the epicenter of the deadly new coronavirus outbreak, has turned into a ghost town, based on video clips shot by a man who returned to Hong Kong from the Hubei provincial capital.

The number of infected people in China has now soared to 440 in 13 provinces and nine have died.

One clip filmed at the Zhongyi Road station on the Wuhan Metro, the man says there was only him and another staffer on the platform. In the second clip filmed on the Zhongshan Avenue, shops are shuttered and only several people are seen.-Photo: screen captures of video clips.
