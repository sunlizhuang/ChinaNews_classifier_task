United States reported the first case of a new coronavirus on Tuesday as the number of cases of the mystery disease in China surpassed 300 in a fast-moving outbreak.

There have so far been six deaths from the disease and US authorities confirmed the first case outside Asia of a patient who travelled to Seattle from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicentre of the outbreak.

The Chinese authorities revealed on Monday for the first time that the deadly disease, a novel coronavirus, could be spread through human to human contact, while the World Health Organization has said it will meet on Wednesday to consider declaring an international health emergency.

Most victims of the disease, which causes fever and breathing difficulties, come from the central city of Wuhan, where the source is believed to have been an animal at a local seafood market.

The latest death was an 89-year-old man who had underlying health issues, including coronary heart disease. He developed symptoms on January 13 and was hospitalised five days later, the authorities said.

Two other deaths in a 66-year-old man and 48-year-old woman were reported on Tuesday, while initial reports suggest 14 health workers - who are most vulnerable to disease outbreaks - have been infected.
