Police apprehended an Iranian national in Florida near Mar-a-Lago. From WPTV:

Palm Beach police are investigating after they say a man believed to be an Iranian national was found with several knives on the Flagler Memorial Bridge on Friday. Police said the man had no known address and was detained by officers. In addition to the knives, police said the man had an undisclosed amount of U.S. currency on him.

We have to point out that earlier there was a report that the border patrol is on red alert for Iranian terrorists who might be trying to sneak in. Coincidence?

AND also, we have to remind everyone that Mar-a-Lago has a problem with uninvited guests sneaking in all the time. Chinese nationals have been caught there and arrested, so it would be a likely target for terrorists.







The Washington Examiner has much more precise details about what he was arrested with:

An Iranian national armed with several knives, a machete, and a pickax was detained Friday by police about four miles from President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The man, identified as an Iranian national named Masoud Yareioeill Zoleh by his passport, was arrested Friday morning at Bradley Park on the east end of the Flagler Memorial Bridge, according to Palm Beach police spokesman Michael Ogrodnick. In addition to the knives, machete, and pickax, police, who responded to a call about Zoleh at around 9:30 a.m., found the man to have $22,000 and a car parked at Palm Beach International Airport.

Very suspicious…

UPDATE:

So, I have to be naturally skeptical about these early reports, BUT, now they’re saying that the guy’s car was discovered at the Palm Beach International Airport.

Watch below:

That is very weird. We’ll update as necessary.
