BEIJING, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- China will arrange or charter flights to bring back passengers stranded overseas due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, according to the country's civil aviation regulator.

Some foreign airlines have reduced or canceled flights because of the outbreak, leaving some passengers stranded overseas, said Zhu Tao, an official with the Civil Aviation Administration of China (ACCA).

The ACCA will keep close contact with the National Health Commission, some relevant departments and airlines to arrange or charter flights to transport passengers in need back to China, Zhu said.

Recently, some domestic and foreign airlines have sent flights from Japan, Thailand, Singapore and other countries to Wuhan to transport passengers back home. Enditem
