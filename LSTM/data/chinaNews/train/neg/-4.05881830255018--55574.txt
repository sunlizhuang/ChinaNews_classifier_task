Tesla's sharp declines Wednesday were characteristic for a commonly shorted stock, so investors should not be too worried, CNBC's Jim Cramer said.

"Tesla's reversal today is something that inevitably happens to red-hot stocks that are too heavily shorted," the "Mad Money" host said. "But unlike so many other heavily shorted names, Tesla's too legit to quit."

Tesla shares rose nearly 20% on Monday and followed that with a 13.7% gain on Tuesday, at one point hitting an all-time intraday high of $968.

But Wednesday brought about a 17.18% pullback for shares of Tesla, closing the session at $734.70. The declines represented the second-worst day for Tesla; it fell 19.3% on one day in 2012.

"This is simply what happens after the sellers let some air out of the balloon, although the fact that Tesla's still up 75% for the year tells you there's plenty of helium left," Cramer said.

Cramer also rejected comparisons of Tesla's past week to bitcoin's massive run in late 2017, when it reached an all-time high of nearly $20,000, and the Tilray short squeeze of 2018, when the cannabis company went from $109 to nearly $3,030 intraday in only a few sessions.

The implication of drawing those parallels is that Tesla's declines have only just begun, Cramer said.

"I think the stock can go lower ... but I think that those comparisons are ludicrous," he said. "Bitcoin was overwhelmed by multiple alternative currencies. Tilray was one among many marijuana companies that came public around the same time, and it was shorted way too soon by many hedge-fund managers, and there was no supply."
