Chinese travellers were returning back to Wuhan from Thailand on Friday, amid growing worldwide restrictions on flights in and out of the city at the epicenter of a new deadly virus outbreak.

Earlier on Friday, Thailand said a taxi driver became its first case of person-to-person spread.

The Southeast Asian country, a popular travel destination for Chinese, has counted 19 cases in all.

Officials said over 20,000 tourists arrived in Thailand from Wuhan, around 10,000 still remain in the country.

Several major airlines this week announced suspensions of their flights to China.

Wuhan has been under tight lockdown as Chinese authorities seek to contain further spread of the virus.
