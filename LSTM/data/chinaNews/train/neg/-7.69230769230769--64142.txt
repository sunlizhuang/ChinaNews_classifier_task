JOHOR BARU: Malaysian workers in Singapore are worried about their health and welfare following the rising number of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases in the republic.

Many Malaysian workers were affected by the outbreak as some employers had shut down operations for two weeks to one month and employees were asked to go on unpaid leave.

Chef Shahran Ariff, 52, who works at a French restaurant in Tanjung Pagar, said many Malaysians felt uneasy when people in the republic started to panic.

He said the panic caused many employers to instruct staff to undergo thermal screenings daily and asking those who were unwell to go home “Many Malaysian workers in Singapore are affected.

“Employers are forced to temporarily cease operations when their employees are suspected to be infected with the coronavirus, especially those who have just returned from China.

“Some employers get scared when workers have a fever of more than 37.5°C, prompting them to issue temporary closure orders of two weeks to a month, with workers told to go on unpaid leave.

“The restaurant I work at is still operating despite having fewer patrons because people are wary of leaving their homes,” he said yesterday.

On Friday, the Singapore government confirmed three more cases of the 2019-nCoV, bringing the total to 33.

The new cases reportedly had no links to previous patients nor did they travel to China recently.

This prompted the authorities to raise the virus alert level to orange, up from yellow, as new cases showed that the deadly pneumonia-like virus was spreading.

The orange alert level was also declared during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2003.

Orange alert is below the highest alert level of red, which would indicate that the virus was spreading widely.

Some 400,000 Malaysians work in Singapore and nearly 100,000 of them commute from Johor Baru to the republic daily.
