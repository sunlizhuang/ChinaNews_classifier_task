Coronavirus update: Information about the outbreak of COVID-19 and how you can protect yourself

Updated

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the new strain of coronavirus, named COVID-19, a global public health emergency.

While the WHO has not yet declared the outbreak a pandemic, the Australian Government has pulled the trigger on its emergency plan.

It is now operating on the basis the virus is a pandemic.

The number of confirmed cases of the flu-like infection worldwide as of Monday had passed 89,000, and more than 3,000 people had died, surpassing the death toll from the 2002/03 SARS outbreak.

Here's a rundown of everything you need to know about coronavirus, and how you can make sure you're protected.

How many people have died?

The death toll worldwide stands at 3,048 as of Monday, with the overwhelming majority in China, according to the WHO and Centre for Disease Control data collated by Johns Hopkins University.

Hubei province, at the epicentre of the outbreak, has reported 2,803 of those.

But a wave of cases outside China are "deeply concerning" the WHO, with sudden increases in Iran, Italy, and South Korea.

On March 1, an elderly Perth man became the first Australian to have died after contracting the virus.

Fifty-four people have died in Iran, and the country's own Deputy Health Minister announced he had been infected.

In Italy, 34 people have died and more than 50,000 people have been placed into lockdown in the north of the country.

South Korea has 26 coronavirus-related deaths, with many of the infections linked to a secretive Christian sect in the southern city of Daegu.

The first coronavirus death in the US has been reported in the state of Washington — a man in his 50s who had underlying health problems but had not travelled to any affected areas.

On Monday, a second death was reported in Washington state.

The Philippines, Japan, France, Hong Kong, and Taiwan have also confirmed fatalities.

What's the fatality rate?

The Australian Department of Health estimates the case fatality rate in China — the percentage of people diagnosed who end up dying from it — is 3.4 per cent.

However, the department said the case fatality rate outside China was 1.5 per cent.

That is less than SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome).

The WHO said 8,000 people became ill with SARS and of those, 774 people died — a rate of 9.6 per cent.

How many are infected?

The infection rate continues to climb, with the total number of infections worldwide on Monday sitting at 89,074, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University.

Almost 80,000 of those cases are in mainland China.

What's the situation in Australia?

Australia's first case was diagnosed on January 25.

Now, 33 people in Australia have been diagnosed with the virus — nine in NSW, nine in Victoria, nine in Queensland, three in South Australia, two in Western Australia and one in Tasmania.

Ten of those are arrivals from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, who have all been medically evacuated to their home states.

The 78-year-old Perth man who died on Sunday had spent time on board the Diamond Princess and had been medically evacuated to Darwin and then flown to Perth.

At least 47 other Diamond Princess passengers were among 621 people to test positive for the virus on board the vessel while it was moored off the Japanese port of Yokohama.

The infected cruise patrons were taken off the ship to Japanese medical facilities.

Three Japanese passengers from the ship, all in their 80s, died after being quarantined in Japan,

Two more Australians in China are confirmed to have been infected.

Fifteen of the Australian patients have recovered and been released, while the others are in a stable condition and being kept in isolation.

How many countries has it reached?

More than 60 countries and territories are affected worldwide so far, according to Johns Hopkins.

China is by far the country with the most confirmed cases.

How does it spread?

Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by what are known as "respiratory droplets" from an infected person — the little secretions we generate when we sneeze or cough.

That's why the spread of the virus between people has generally occurred through close contact.

Two cases of human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus have occurred in Australia.

One was a 53-year-old frontline health worker in western Sydney.

It's not known how he contracted coronavirus but NSW Health said he had been working in direct contact with patients.

The other is a 41-year-old woman whose brother had tested positive for the virus after returning from Iran. She had been in close contact with him.

Who is at risk?

By far, the largest at-risk group is those who have been in Hubei province in China — in particular, its capital Wuhan — or have been in contact with someone who is a confirmed coronavirus case.

The overwhelming majority of coronavirus cases can be connected, directly or indirectly, to an illegal wildlife market in Wuhan.

The city, as well as at least 16 other neighbouring cities with a combined population of more than 50 million, have been in lockdown since January 24.

About 500 million people in China are currently subject to policies put in place restricting movement.

If you have not been to China, your risk of contracting coronavirus is significantly lower.

If you were on one particular Tigerair Australia plane between January 27 and 30, you may be contacted by the airline and should immediately get medical attention if you develop symptoms.

What are the symptoms?

Many people with the virus look and feel like they have the flu.

The symptoms range from more minor ailments — like a sore throat, fatigue, coughing, and a runny nose — to more serious symptoms like difficulty breathing.

Those with severe breathing problems concern doctors the most, as early analysis suggests the virus is more likely to be fatal in people exhibiting serious breathlessness.

Authorities believe elderly people, or those with underlying health conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure, are more likely to experience severe symptoms, but healthy and younger people have been affected too.

How do people die from it?

In the most severe cases, the virus causes pneumonia — the infection of one or both lungs — which can be deadly.

Other serious complications include respiratory distress or failure, septic shock, acute kidney injury, virus-induced cardiac injury and secondary bacterial pneumonia.

What's the best way to avoid catching it?

You should be taking every precaution you normally would to avoid catching the flu.

Keep your hands as clean as possible through washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitiser.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at home, work or school, especially when someone is sick.

There is no need for the general public to wear face masks.

If you have a trip to anywhere in China planned, Australian authorities are now urging you not to travel.

In any case, it is becoming difficult to get there, with a raft of travel restrictions in place within China and airlines reducing or cancelling services.

What should I do if I have recently returned from China?

If you have returned from anywhere in China, not just Hubei province, authorities are asking you to isolate yourself for 14 days.

If your child has recently returned from China, he or she may be requested or required to stay home from school.

Time for a reality check

Even if you have been to China or Wuhan, or suspect you have been in contact with someone who has, there is no need to panic.

The flu is also circulating in Australia at the moment and the fact you might feel sick does not mean you have contracted this new strain of coronavirus.

Hundreds of thousands of people are diagnosed with the flu each year in Australia.

Australia's chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said most people who were being tested for coronavirus returned a negative result.

"The main message that we're trying to give still to the Australian public is that there is no cause for concern," he said.

"We're testing a large number of people across the country every day.

"The majority of them are negative as we always expected it to be, but we do expect that it is likely we might find some more positives over the next few days, but we are extremely well prepared."

What should I do if I think I have coronavirus?

If you have been to China and you are experiencing flu-like symptoms, you should immediately phone your GP and explain your symptoms and your travel history.

Do not make an appointment or attend a GP practice or hospital without informing them first, as they will need to make arrangements to protect others before you arrive.

How do doctors treat it?

There is no 100 per cent effective treatment for coronavirus, but in most cases, doctors treat it in the same way they treat the flu.

This could involve prescribing antiviral medication used to treat influenzas A and B as well as HIV, or antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections.

There is no vaccine yet, but scientists around the world — including in Australia — are working hard to develop one.

What should I do if I'm sick but don't think I have coronavirus?

Take all the normal steps you would while sick, including keeping your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too.

Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing and wash your hands frequently.

Throw your tissue into a closed bin immediately after use and avoid spitting in public.

What if I had plans to travel to or from China?

If you had a trip to China planned, the Federal Government is urging you to make other arrangements for the time being.

Authorities have raised travel advice for the whole of mainland China to level 4 — the highest level.

The advice recommends Australians do not travel to mainland China due to the threat of the coronavirus outbreak.

Foreign nationals will not be granted entry into Australia for 14 days from the time they have left China unless they meet several exceptions.

This restriction will not apply to Australian citizens, permanent residents or their immediate family members, or Chinese high school students (who will be individually assessed).

What is the World Health Organisation doing?

On January 31, the WHO declared the new strain of coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), however it has stopped short of declaring it a pandemic.

The PHEIC declaration triggers a suite of recommendations for all countries aimed at preventing or reducing the cross-border spread of disease, while avoiding unnecessary interference with trade and travel.

National health authorities worldwide will be asked to step up their monitoring, preparedness and containment measures.
