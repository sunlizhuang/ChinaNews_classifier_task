But along with general silence, there was confusion.

The announcements about which vehicles were allowed on the roads were murky, leaving even police officers befuddled.

First, the Wuhan authorities said that most cars should stay off the roads and that a fleet of 6,000 taxis would be on call to transport people in need and deliver food and medicine. Then, the authorities said drivers would be notified by text message if they had to stay off the roads. Nobody seemed to receive text messages on Sunday.

“My understanding,” a police officer said, “is that you can drive in your district if you don’t get a text message telling you that you can’t. But you should check that with the transport authorities.”

In the end, most drivers stayed off the streets. But as the day went on, more ventured out, and the police did not seem to do much about it.

For some residents, it was another exasperating fumble by Wuhan officials who many believe have mishandled the epidemic. But most seemed to accept the restrictions with the same stoicism that many have shown since the city imposed bans on leaving for all but a select few.

On Sunday morning, many groceries in Wuhan were crowded with residents stocking up, especially on fresh vegetables, fruit and meat, in case even tighter rules might be announced that impeded food supplies or that deterred them from leaving home.

“Because it’s the New Year, a lot of stores close anyway, and now we have the disease and now this,” said Ai Wenjun, who had lined up to pay for a basket of turnips, cabbage and beans. “Each extra thing makes me worry more.”
