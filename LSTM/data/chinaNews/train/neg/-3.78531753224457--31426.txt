Coronavirus testings of seven patients in New York have come back negative, and three other potential cases awaited results Tuesday as U.S. authorities scrambled to limit threats from the outbreak that began in China.

While coronavirus has not been detected in New York, authorities have investigated 10 total cases amid statewide public health alerts, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday. Some efforts have been focused on helping colleges and businesses monitor travelers recently returning from China.

"My message to New Yorkers is: take this coronavirus seriously, take proper precautions, stay informed, but also feel confident that our Health Department and this administration are prepared and ready," Cuomo said in a statement.

State health officials have declined to provide details about the locations of the 10 cases that have been investigated. Broome County officials on Tuesday announced two adults tested negative for coronavirus after being evaluated at local medical facilities.

The University of Rochester also was monitoring students and faculty who traveled to Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, and other sites in Asia recently.

What's the latest in the coronavirus outbreak

Authorities announced U.S. consulate staffers and other Americans in Wuhan will be evacuated to California on Wednesday as the death toll rose to 106 from a new coronavirus racing through China.

In the U.S., Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Tuesday the number of cases remained at five, with no deaths. Researchers are still trying to determine the incubation period of the virus and how easily it can be spread by infected people who are not yet experiencing symptoms.

"This is a potentially very serious threat, but at this point, Americans should not worry for their own safety," Azar said. "This is a very fast-moving, constantly-changing situation."

Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China, is one of more than a dozen under tight lockdown as the government struggles to contain the virus.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. State Department late Monday expanded their travel advisories to cover all of China due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The broader travel alerts came as the U.S. plans to expand screening for the virus to 20 airports from the current five, including John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.

Details on the additional airports have not been released but Vice President Mike Pence said in a speech Monday that the airports collectively handle 90% of all passengers from China.
