BEIJING, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- China here on Friday urged the U.S. side to immediately stop oppressing Chinese businesses after the U.S. Justice Department added new charges against Chinese tech giant Huawei.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang stressed at an online press briefing that the Chinese government encouraged Chinese enterprises to conduct overseas business cooperation in accordance with local laws, the market principle and international rules.

The U.S. side "has been misusing its national power to oppress Chinese companies with no proof of any wrongdoing," said Geng, adding that "such practice is disgraceful and immoral, and it is beneath the status of the United States as a major country."

Geng said U.S. economic bullying practices were a blatant denial of the market principle, for which the United States had been a self-claimed champion. It severely undermined the reputation and credibility of the United States, as well as the interests of American companies.
