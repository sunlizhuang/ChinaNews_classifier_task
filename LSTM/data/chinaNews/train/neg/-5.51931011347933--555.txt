There’s almost no limit to the hubris of the president and his closeted advisors when it comes to the military might of the United States. But Sept. 11 should have taught us that we cannot stop everyone determined to do us serious harm.

Moreover, this foolish provocation occurs when Trump has alienated many of our traditional allies and further created and enraged even more enemies. For those who may not get the picture, a recent article outlining the concurrence of Russia, China and Iran holding joint military exercises in the Gulf of Oman is enlightening. The U.S. has considered the Straits of Hormuz, through which some 16 million barrels of oil a day are transported, as if it belonged to us. It does not, however, and the recent exercise was and is intended to signal an end to American hegemony in the Gulf.

Add to this the unnerving announcement last week that Russia has developed and is deploying hypersonic missiles that travel at 27 times the speed of sound. Not only don’t we have hypersonic missiles, our current missile defenses are useless against them. In other words, the massive aircraft carriers we have deployed in the Gulf for decades are now large, slow, and vulnerable targets.
