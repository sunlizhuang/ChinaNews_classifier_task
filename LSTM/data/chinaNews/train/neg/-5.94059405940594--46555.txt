Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok has reinstated the account of Live Action, which has the largest social media presence of any nonprofit pro-life organization, hours after banning it for “violating” the app’s community guidelines. It was removed due to a “human error,” the app now says.

“We received an email from TikTok … apologizing for what TikTok is calling ‘human error.’ They admitted that our account ‘is not in violation of any of our Community Guidelines,’” Lila Rose, the founder of the leading digital pro-life organization, said in a statement, urging TikTok to “improve their training and oversight to ensure that such dramatic ‘human errors’ like this aren’t made in the future for us or any other pro-life organization.”

The platform, on which short music videos are shared and has over 800 million active users, blamed it on a “moderator.” The pro-life group’s account was banned late last week after it posted a 15-second educational video featuring baby faces, “highlighting lives saved by our content and raising awareness of the importance of speaking out on abortion,” Rose said.
