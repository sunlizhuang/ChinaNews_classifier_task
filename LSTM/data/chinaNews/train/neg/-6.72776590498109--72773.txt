A man diagnosed with coronavirus in Taiwan has reportedly died, marking the first fatality from the disease in the East Asian country.

Taiwan Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said at a news conference on Sunday that the man was in his 60s and that he had not traveled outside the country recently, according to Reuters. He also had diabetes and hepatitis B, the health minister noted.

The death comes as officials from around the world work to contain the deadly virus, which has infected thousands of people across more than a dozen countries. The effects of the virus, which first appeared in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, have been most pronounced in China.

The National Health Commission on Saturday reported 68,500 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 1,665 deaths stemming from it. The group also noted that Hubei, the province where Wuhan is located, had 1,843 new cases of confirmed infections.

In addition to Taiwan, the Philippines, Japan and Hong Kong have reported deaths stemming from the coronavirus within its borders. Taiwan officials said Sunday that the country has now confirmed 20 cases of the disease.

France also announced Saturday that a Chinese man had died from the coronavirus in the country. The French health minister said that the man, 80, had been hospitalized in January after traveling to China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak.

The World Health Organization has warned that the virus poses a "very grave threat for the rest of the world." Fears over the virus have led countries such as the U.S. to impose certain travel restrictions on outbound flights to China. The U.S. had confirmed 15 cases of the virus as of Sunday, according to a database from Johns Hopkins University.
