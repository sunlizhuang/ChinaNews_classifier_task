For Furman University senior Anna Zhang, what was initially intended as a brief visit from her mom turned into more of a “stay-cation.” "My mom booked her flight tickets very early, very long ago, and she came over on Jan. 22,” Zhang said. “That was probably a day or two before the actual big outbreak of the (new coronavirus) in China. So she came into the country without any problems.” But getting out of the country is a different story. Delta and American Airlines suspended flights between the U.S. and China already, and starting tomorrow, United Airlines will follow suit. “She was supposed to fly back yesterday, but she’s still here,” Zhang said with a smile. But for some Chinese students and Asian Americans, impacts of the virus are being felt beyond canceled flights. In the weeks since the epidemic emerged from China, some Asians have recounted episodes of discrimination. “I don’t think we have felt any spoken discrimination as of right now but what about the implicit, the unspoken discrimination, in their mind? So I encourage people to have this change of mind and not let fear or things like that control our minds,” Zhang said.Devin Zhang, Christy Litz, Anna Zhang and Ada Zhao all tell WYFF News 4’s Madeleine Hackett that they have not experienced personal stereotyping or racism but it’s more in what hasn’t been spoken. They say overall, the community has been empathetic. “Yesterday when I went to the infirmary to get my flu shot, the doctor I had said, ‘Oh I’m wearing this mask to protect myself from all the students who get the flu, I’m not wearing this mask because you’re Chinese,’’ Zhao said. “I think that’s very warm-hearted.”
