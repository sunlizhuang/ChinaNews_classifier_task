Sick Passenger Escorted Off BWI Flight Did Not Meet Criteria For Coronavirus

A passenger who recently traveled to China, experiencing flu-like symptoms, was escorted off a Southwest Airlines flight at BWI Airport Saturday. The person was evaluated and did not meet the testing criteria for the coronavirus, according to the Maryland Health Department.

Around 2 p.m. Saturday, Southwest Flight 2889 arrived from Las Vegas to Baltimore when local medical crews met flight personnel upon their arrival due to the passenger's symptoms, according to Southwest.

The passenger was taken for medical evaluation given their symptoms and having recently traveled to Beijing, China, the Maryland Health Department said in a statement.

"The person did not meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Criteria for 2019 novel coronavirus testing but was referred to a medical facility for evaluation to determine whether additional follow-up was necessary," the health department said. "Per guidance from the CDC, no special action was indicated for this person or for any other passengers or crew on the flight... Following evaluation by medical personnel, the person was released."

Southwest officials told the Baltimore Sun flight personnel followed recommendations from the CDC "out of an abundance of caution, and in light of the recent concerns of the coronavirus," after the passenger reported flu-like symptoms.

Health department officials report the passenger was "screened and cleared" in both Mexico and Las Vegas prior to boarding their flight to Baltimore.

This incident occurred during heightened precautions after the coronavirus has killed dozens in Wuhan, China, where the virus first broke out. Since its outbreak, more than 1,000 people have been infected by the virus, according to the Sun.

Only two cases of the coronavirus have been reported in the United States, one in Chicago and another in Seattle.
