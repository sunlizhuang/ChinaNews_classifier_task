The Supreme People's Procuratorate has decided to arrest Li Qian, former vice-governor of North China's Hebei province, for allegedly accepting bribes, according to a notice released on Friday by the top procuratorate's website.

Li, also a former Party member with the Hebei government, was expelled in January from the Communist Party of China and dismissed from his post for seriously violating Party discipline and the country's laws, according to the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission, the country's top anti-corruption watchdog.

Investigation into Li began in August and a criminal case concerning him is being further processed.

The anti-graft watchdog discovered that Li, 60, had illegally accepted gifts and large sums of money to help others gain profits in real estate developments and construction projects.

They also found Li had a lavish and dissolute lifestyle. His illicit gains have been confiscated.
