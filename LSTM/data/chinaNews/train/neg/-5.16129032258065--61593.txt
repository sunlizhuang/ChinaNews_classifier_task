Udupi deputy commissioner G Jagadeesha confirmed to media about the admission of the said persons to the isolation ward and said as a precautionary measure they have been kept in the isolation ward. He also said that the patients’ samples required for testing were already sent to Bengaluru for testing and the results will be received by 48 hours.

Speaking to Daijiworld.com, Dr Sudhir Chandra Suda, district health officer said, “Four people have visited China, but none of them visited Wuhan, the city where Coronavirus is largely spreading. They are kept in the isolation ward at Ajjarkad hospital. They have normal symptoms like cough and fever. Today, their throat infection report has been sent to Bengaluru lab for test. We assume 99% that the four are not infected by Coronavirus. But as a precautionary measure, we have kept them in isolation ward.

“Some others also got their check up done at government hospital. They had visited China recently. But these persons are not infected by Coronavirus,” he said.

Earlier, KMC Hospital Manipal, in a statement, clarified that some vested interests are spreading fake news about Coronavirus patients found in their hospital which is false.
