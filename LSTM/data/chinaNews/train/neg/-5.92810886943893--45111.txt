— With an eighth case of the coronavirus confirmed in the United States — this time in Massachusetts — concerns about the virus are spreading.

Public health officials said Saturday the patient is a 20-year-old student who recently returned to the United States from Wuhan, China, the source of the coronavirus outbreak. Worldwide, around 10,000 people are said to be infected with the virus.

Coronavirus vs. flu Definition: Both coronavirus and flu are categories. The coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 is a new strain of the virus – COVID-19. Symptoms: Coronavirus and flu symptoms are similar – runny nose, cough, sneezing and then chest congestion. Prevention: Both the flu and coronavirus spread from person to person through droplets in the air from an infected person coughing, sneezing or talking. The common-sense steps to contain any virus, no matter the flu, coronavirus or a common cold, are washing hands frequently with soap, covering coughs and sneezes and disinfecting surfaces. The surgeon general does not recommend the use of masks for otherwise healthy people. Deaths: While COVID-19 is new and a growing worldwide threat, the flu annually sickens and kills vastly more people. Almost 3,600 people had died of COVID-19 through March 7, 2020. Compare that to 646,000 flu deaths worldwide this winter and 18,000 to 46,000 deaths in the U.S. per year. Got questions?

Here in the Triangle, concerns about the virus have created a mass shortage of face masks. It's a problem that's being seen in other parts of the country and world, too.

Drugstores like Walgreens are running out of masks because fear of coronavirus is driving the demand.

We found an empty shelf where faces masks are usually stored at the Walgreens on Hillandale Street in Durham. And another empty shelf at Durham’s Medical Supply Superstore. An employee told WRAL the store sold out of 200 boxes.

"With the coronavirus coming about now, I think it's not bad to be too cautious," said Sylvia Watson-Williams, a nursing aide. "So I think better safe than sorry."

It’s a reality affecting stores nationwide as the coronavirus outbreak spreads beyond China. Watson-Williams’s nursing background helps her understand how severe the disease has become.

"It can affect your upper respiratory system," Watson-Williams said. "But if affects it in a much stronger way and much stronger than a normal flu."

However, medical experts we spoke with say their effectiveness against this illness is limited.

The CDC is not recommending the use of face masks to protect against respiratory illness. It recommends masks for healthcare workers, and people who are sick, to keep from spreading germs. Top health officials says the best way to avoid getting sick is washing your hands regularly throughout the day.

It's a practice Watson-Williams lives by.

"Disinfecting is definitely the key," Watson-Williams said.

Dr. Allen G. Mask, MD, told WRAL while the face masks are limited in effectiveness, it’s still a good precaution. He warned the flu is currently a bigger concern in our area.
