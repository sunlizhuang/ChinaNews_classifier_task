PETALING JAYA: The Terrengganu state health department has denied allegations that five Chinese nationals tested positive for the 2019-nCoV infection, and were admitted to the Sultanah Nur Zahirah hospital (HSNZ).

State health director Dr Nor Azimi Yunus said as of Jan 26 this year, there were no cases of 2019-nCoV in the state.

This came following a viral statement on the Facebook page ‘Gabungan Anak Terengganu (Original)’ by a user named Ali Dapicey, that said five individuals suspected to have tested positive for the virus were admitted to HSNZ.

Nor Azimi urged the members of the public to be careful with fake news and not to spread any other forms of online misinformation that could cause unnecessary panic.

He also advised the public to maintain good personal hygiene and to avoid visiting crowded places.
