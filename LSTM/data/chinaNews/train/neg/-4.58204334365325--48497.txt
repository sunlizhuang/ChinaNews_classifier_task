China has blamed the United States for spreading fears about the coronavirus, while also accusing Washington of doing nothing to help contain the outbreak.The Chinese foreign ministry made the accusation on Monday, as the number of deaths in mainland China attributed to the coronavirus overtook the Sars epidemic of 2003.Mainland health officials also called on people to pay extra attention to personal hygiene afterChinese health authorities announced 361 fatalities and 17,205 cases attributable to the rapidly spreading illness, as of Sunday, with 2,829 new cases and 57 deaths. That compares with 2,590 new cases and 45 deaths, nationwide, on Saturday.Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a written statement that many countries appreciated China's efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus, with the exception of the US."But in the meantime, some countries, the US in particular, have inappropriately overreacted, which certainly runs counter to WHO advice," she said."The US government has not provided any substantial assistance to us, but it was the first to evacuate personnel from its consulate in Wuhan, the first to suggest partial withdrawal of its embassy staff, and the first to impose a travel ban on Chinese travellers. All it has done could only create and spread fear, which is a bad example."Hua said flu had caused 19 million cases of infection and at least 10,000 deaths in the US from 2019 to 2020, while numbers were far lower for the coronavirus."The contrast is thought provoking. I also noted that the Canadian Minister of Health said Canada would not follow the US and impose travel restrictions on Chinese or foreign nationals who have been to China," Hua said."Canada believes the entry ban has no basis, which is a sharp contrast to the US behaviour," she said.Chinese troops based in Wuhan have taken control of the delivery of basic essentials to people living in the city, as the number of deaths in mainland China attributed to the coronavirus has overtaken the Sars epidemic of 2003.State broadcaster CCTV reported that a backup logistics team , made up of troops based in Hubei, was established on Monday and had delivered 200 tonnes of supplies to supermarkets in Wuhan, using 50 military trucks.
