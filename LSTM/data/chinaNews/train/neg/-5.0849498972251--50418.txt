The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Tuesday said it hopes the U.S. could soon provide the aid it promised for the fight against the coronavirus outbreak.

"China noted the U.S. has made repeated offers to provide aid to China to fight the outbreak. We hope Washington could provide the offered aid soon," Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said Tuesday in a statement.

Hua repeated that the U.S. should work with China and the international community in battling the viral outbreak, instead of overreacting.

The ministry on Monday criticized the U.S. for "creating and spreading fear" after Washington responded to the epidemic by evacuating its embassy staff and imposing travel bans on Chinese travelers, which led other countries to follow suit.
