DUSHANBE -- Tajikistan has suspended all air flights to Iran as many countries in the region scramble to take precautions after Tehran announced the highest death toll from the coronavirus outside of China.



Aziz Nabizoda, the deputy director of the Tajik Civil Aviation Agency, said all flights were suspended as of February 24.

According to Nabizoda, the agency has informed Iran's Varesh Airlines, as well as domestic airlines Tajik Air and Somoni Air, of the move.



Iran's semiofficial ILNA news agency reported on February 24 that 50 people had died from the virus in the central city of Qom, but Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi rejected the report, telling a news conference that the total number of confirmed cases stood at 61, including 12 deaths.



Iran is one of the most popular destinations for Tajiks as the two nations share historical, linguistic, and cultural ties.
