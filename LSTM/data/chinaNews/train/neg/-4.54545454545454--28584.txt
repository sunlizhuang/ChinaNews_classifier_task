There have been 2,880 confirmed cases of the coronavirus since it first emerged in China â€“ believed to have originated in the meat markets of Wuhan city.

The virus has led to the deaths of 81 people and the head of the National Health Commission in China, Ma Xiaowei, warned that battling the virus is difficult.

It has been discovered that it can spread during the incubation period which lasts between one to 14 days unlike SARS.

Xiaowei said: "there are signs the virus is becoming more transmissible."

He said the problem of healthy-seeming hidden carriers was "making controlling the outbreak a lot more difficult".

The chief of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said that the epidemic "is still growing" but confirmed there had been no signs the virus is mutating into a more deadly form.
