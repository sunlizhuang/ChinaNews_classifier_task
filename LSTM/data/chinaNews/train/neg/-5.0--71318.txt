MANILA, Philippines — Taiwanese nationals can now enter the Philippines after the Philippine government lifted travel restrictions going to and from Taiwan amid the COVID-19 threat, the Bureau of Immigration (BI) said Saturday.

“This follows the resolution of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Infectious Disease (IATF), which we are bound to implement immediately. Hence, travel may now be made by any foreign national to Taiwan from the Philippines and vice versa,” BI Commissioner Jaime Morente said in a statement.

On Friday, presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo disclosed that the travel ban to Taiwan was lifted as per the recommendation of the IATF. The travel ban on Taiwan was previously imposed as a precautionary measure against the COVID-19 disease, formerly known as the 2019-novel coronavirus.

However, the government’s travel ban remains imposed on foreign nationals coming from mainland China,Hong Kong and Macau. The BI only allowed Filipinos and permanent visa holders to enter the Philippines from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau.
