BEIJING (Dunya News) – Spokesperson at the Chinese foreign ministry on Sunday has thanked Pakistan and other countries for showing satisfaction over treatment of patients suffering from coronavirus.



In a statement, the spokesperson said that Pakistan, Russia, Korea and Belarus are helping China in curbing the outbreak of coronavirus. The representative added that France, Germany and Malaysia are also supporting China in this difficult situation.



A friend in need is a friend indeed, the spokesperson went on to say.



It is to be mentioned here that the death toll from China’s coronavirus epidemic soared to 304, as an increasing number of countries imposed extraordinary Chinese travel bans to combat the spread of the disease.

With Britain, Russia and Sweden among the countries confirming their first infections, the virus has now spread to more than two dozen nations, sending governments scurrying to limit their exposure.

The United States and Australia are leading a growing list of countries that are putting temporary but sweeping travel restrictions on Chinese nationals or those who have travelled to China within the last two weeks.
