BEIJING (AP) — Inspectors in protective suits went door-to-door Wednesday in the epicenter of China's viral outbreak to try to find every infected person in an epidemic that is showing signs of waning as new cases fell for a second straight day.

The city of Wuhan, where the new form of coronavirus emerged, was in the final day of a campaign to root out anyone with symptoms whom authorities may have missed so far.

“This must be taken seriously," said Wang Zhonglin, the city's newly minted Communist Party secretary, adding that “if a single new case is found" after Wednesday “the district leaders will be held responsible."

His remarks were published on Hubei's provincial website, alongside the declaration, “If the masses cannot mobilize, it's impossible to fight a people's war.”

Mainland China reported 1,749 new cases and 136 additional deaths. While the overall spread of the virus has been slowing, the situation remains severe in Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan. More than 80% of the country's 74,185 total cases are in Hubei and 95% of its 2,004 deaths, according to data from China's National Health Commission.
