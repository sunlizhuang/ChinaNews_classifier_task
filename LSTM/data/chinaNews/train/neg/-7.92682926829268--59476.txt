Saudi Arabia on Thursday banned its citizens and residents of the Kingdom from traveling to China amid the new virus outbreak.

The Kingdom's General Directorate of Passports said the measure was in response to the new virus believed to have stemmed from central China.

It warned that any residents of the Kingdom who violate this order will not allowed to return to Saudi Arabia. It also said that regulatory provisions on travel documents would be applied to citizens who violate the travel ban, without further elaboration. The statement was carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency.

On Sunday, Saudi Arabiaâ€™s flagship national carrier, Saudia, joined other major airlines in suspending flights to China. Also on Sunday, 10 Saudi students were evacuated from the Chinese city Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, and quarantined upon arrival to Riyadh for two weeks.
