(Bloomberg) -- New Zealand will deny entry to foreigners traveling from mainland China, to help combat the spread of the deadly coronavirus.

The ban covers anyone who is traveling from or has transited through China, and will be effective Feb. 3 and last up to 14 days, the government said in a statement Sunday. It has also raised its travel advice about all of mainland China to “do not travel,” the highest level.

Australia has also imposed a two-week ban on tourist arrivals from China.
