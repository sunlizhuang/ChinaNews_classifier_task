LOS ANGELES, Calif. (WBZ NewsRadio) â€” Officials in Los Angeles County have confirmed the fourth U.S. case of the deadly Coronavirus, and a fifth case has been diagnosed in a patient in Arizona.

There are now two cases in California; one in Orange County and one in Los Angeles County. There is also one case near Seattle, and another patient diagnosed in Chicago. All five patients had recently traveled to China, which seems to be the epicenter of the virus.

There is also one suspected case at Texas A&M University, and a student from Wesleyan University in Connecticut is being monitored for possibly contracting the virus as well.

Both of the patients in California have been isolated in undisclosed hospitals, and local officials say there is no evidence of any person-to-person transmission.
