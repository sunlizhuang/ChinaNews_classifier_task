One person who recently returned to Jamaica from China and was placed in quarantine has been isolated after showing signs of an elevated temperature.

The Government, through the Ministry of Health and Wellness, provided an update on the coronavirus at a press conference yesterday.

This brings the total number of persons in isolation to two.

Health Minister Dr Christopher Tufton said samples have been taken and will be processed by the National Influenza Centre and sent overseas for testing.

"This morning, one person in quarantine, having spent approximately eight days, was detected to have had an elevated temperature and as a consequence will be isolated as per our protocols," Tufton said. "This is the first time we have detected symptoms in any patient or person who is being monitored and have had to move a patient or individual from quarantine to isolation."

Tufton said the ministry will continue to monitor the patient for any further development, while the other patient will soon be released.

"Between January 23 and February 8, one hundred and sixteen persons arrived in Jamaica who had been in China 14 days prior to arrival. One person had mild symptoms and was immediately isolated. That person's symptoms have since improved," Tufton said.
