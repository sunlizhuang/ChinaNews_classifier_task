The third patient to be diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK is reportedly being treated at a hospital in London.

Health officials confirmed that a third case of the virus had been discovered in the UK shortly after 1pm today.

The patient, who was in an Asian country when they caught coronavirus - but not mainland China, is thought to have been diagnosed in Brighton.

They are being transferred to London, where there are infectious diseases units at Guy's and St Thomas' and the Royal Free hospitals.

In a statement, Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty said: "The patient is being transferred to a specialist NHS centre, and we are using robust infection control measures to prevent any possible further spread of the virus.

"The NHS is well prepared to manage these cases and we are now working quickly to identify any contacts the patient has had."

Prof Whitty did not say whether it was caught directly from someone who had been in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak.

The University of Sussex, which has a large campus on the outskirts of Brighton, said in a statement the new case was not a student or member of staff from the university.
