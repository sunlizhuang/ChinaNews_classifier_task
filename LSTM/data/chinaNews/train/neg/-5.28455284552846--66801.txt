IN THE NEWS: CHINESE MILITARY MEMBERS CHARGED WITH EQUIFAX BREAK-IN

WASHINGTON (AP) — It was one of the largest hacking attacks to target consumer data — and now the U.S. government is blaming it on China. The Justice Department has charged four members of the Chinese military with the massive incursion into the Equifax credit reporting agency. The 2017 break-in netted personal information for tens of millions of Americans. It’s believed the hackers made off with the data of roughly 145 million people — including vital stuff like names, addresses, Social Security and driver's license numbers and other data stored in the company's databases.

IN THE NEWS: BATTLE BETWEEN RIDE-HAILING FIRMS AND PHOENIX ESCALATES

PHOENIX (AP) — The battle between ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft and officials in Phoenix has now become more heated. Arizona state lawmakers have introduced a measure that would keep Phoenix officials from levying fees on ride-sharing firms that use Sky Harbor airport. Phoenix’s plan to hit Uber and Lyft with higher fees led the app-based services to threaten to stop serving the main airport in one of the U.S.’s biggest cities. Phoenix wanted to begin imposing the new fees on Feb. 1. But they’re on hold after the state Attorney General determined last month that the fees are “very likely” unconstitutional.

ON THE WEB: JUUL SUED BY PENN. A.G.’S OFFICE

CYBERSPACE (AP) — The e-cigarette company Juul Labs is facing yet another lawsuit filed by a U.S. state. Pennsylvania is the latest to take the company to court over its marketing practices. The A.G. wants the courts to halt Juul’s e-cigarette sales in the state — or force it to change the way it does business. Nearly a quarter of high school students in Pennsylvania report they use e-cigarettes. Similar lawsuits have been filed in other states, including New York, California and Minnesota.
