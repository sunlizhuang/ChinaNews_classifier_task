The appearance of the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan has resulted in an outbreak of xenophobia directed at Chinese and those of Chinese origin in many countries. Schools in Europe have withdrawn invitations to exchange students. Restaurants in South Korea have turned away Chinese customers. The abhorrent concept of the Yellow Peril, a racist reference to East Asians that goes back to the 19th century, resurfaced in a French newspaper. In Denmark, a newspaper cartoon drew China's flag with virus symbols instead of stars. In Malaysia, more than 400,000 people signed a petition to ban China nationals from entry. Hundreds of hospital workers in Hong Kong have gone on strike to demand that the border with mainland China be closed completely. Even residents of Chinese origin have not been spared. Thus, some Chinese Canadians are complaining of a repeat of the racism they faced during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) outbreak, which also emerged in China.

Although not close to the anti-Chinese xenophobia exhibited elsewhere, creeping discrimination in Singapore is in danger of feeding into a malevolent international pattern. Sentiments against citizens of China have emerged among some groups. Online, there are posts directed against China nationals. Worse, on the ground, there are reports of discrimination against those nationals whether by landlords depriving them of their tenancies or by service providers denying them service. Legality aside, this is no way in which to meet the admittedly formidable challenge posed by the virus. Fear of infection is understandable, but discrimination against people is out of sync with both the moral imperatives and practical needs of Singapore, where foreigners are an integral part of its globalised economy.
