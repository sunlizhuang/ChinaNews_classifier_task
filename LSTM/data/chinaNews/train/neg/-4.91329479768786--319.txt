New Delhi:

A couple of weeks after popular TV actor Kushal Punjabi’s sad demise, wife Audrey Dolhen has come out and spoken about her husband’s death and being blamed for the death of the television actor.

According to Dolhen, Kushal is to be blamed for their “failed relationship” and even called him a “careless father”. It was reported that Kushal’s failed marriage with Dolhen and financial crisis was the reason behind him taking the tragic step. The two got married in 2015.

“We had problems in our marriage but it was not a failed marriage. I never stopped Kian from talking to his father Kushal. It was Kushal who was not serious about his family,” Dolhen told PeepingMoon.com.

“I invited him to settle down in Shanghai but he was least interested. In fact, it was me who was looking after his expenses. Kian lost interest in his father because of lack of seriousness. I tried my best to save my relationship with Kushal,” she added.

Dolhen, who is currently working as CCO in CMA CGM China Shipping Company said that she in contract bound in her job “I was on contract with my company and Kushal was not able to understand this. He wanted me to shift to London. It was not possible for me to quit my job. Kushal was a careless father who never bothered about his son’s future. I was at the receiving end in the marriage and not him. I was with our son Kian in France for Christmas holidays,” she said.

“I don’t know why I am being blamed for his death, it was Kushal who failed in our relationship,” Dolhen added.

According Dolhen, Kushal’s parents accused her of harassing him and for demanding a huge sum of money for a divorce. They said that she took away their three-year-old son Kian, which shattered Kushal and made him take his life.

Dolhen has been summoned by Mumbai Police in connection with Kushal’s suicide.
