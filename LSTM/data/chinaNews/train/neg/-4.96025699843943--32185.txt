New Zealand's Government has raised its coronavirus travel alert level to include all of China, telling Kiwis to 'avoid any non-essential travel to the country.'

The move is a significant increase from warnings made by the NZ Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which confined the highest level of warnings to just the Hubei Province where the virus began.

Travellers to other parts of China were told to "exercise normal safety and security precautions" while travelling, but Wednesday's advisory update, posted on the Safetravel website, recommends people don't travel there at all.

This update brings New Zealand's response into line with that of the United States which warned against all non-essential travel to anywhere in China on Tuesday.
