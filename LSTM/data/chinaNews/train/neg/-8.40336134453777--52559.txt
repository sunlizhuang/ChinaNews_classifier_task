Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited on a wide variety of nations in his recent tour of of Europe and Central Asia, but his message stayed the same: Beware of China. Pompeo denounced China’s human rights record, criticized its aggressive trade practices and urged his hosts to be wary of Chinese investment and influence. He warned that China poses a risk as countries develop next-generation, high-speed wireless networks. His language was blunt, calling the Chinese Communist Party “the central threat of our times.” Pompeo’s tough rhetoric underscores his preoccupation with the country and its recent diplomatic and trade victories.
