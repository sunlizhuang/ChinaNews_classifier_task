CHINA revoked the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal reporters today over what it called a racist headline in the paper.

The US broadsheet ran an article on the coronavirus outbreak entitled The real sick man of Asia, which Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said “smears the efforts of the Chinese government and people on fighting the epidemic.”

The phrase dates back to the 19th century when it was used to describe the declining Chinese empire as it struggled to resist European exploitation.

China’s move is likely a retaliation for the Donald Trump administration’s decision on Tuesday to classify five Chinese news outlets as “foreign missions,” subjecting them to much closer state monitoring.

China’s tabloid Global Times newspaper said that the “ideological clash” between Washington and Beijing was intensifying.

China announced 98 more deaths from coronavirus on Tuesday, including that of Liu Zhiming, the director of a hospital in Wuhan’s Wuchang district that bore the brunt of the earliest cases.
