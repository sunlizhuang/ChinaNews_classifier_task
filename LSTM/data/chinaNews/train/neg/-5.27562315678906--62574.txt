BEIJING, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- Acts of deliberately or permissibly spreading the coronavirus shall be punished as the crime of endangering public safety by dangerous means, according to the Ministry of Public Security (MPS).

Public security departments across the country have attached great importance to such acts and have promptly filed cases for investigation.

Police in Jinghong, southwest China's Yunnan Province, have investigated a patient surnamed Li for endangering public safety by dangerous means.

Li had traveled to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, from December 2019 to January 2020. After returning to Jinghong, she had a cough and other symptoms and was confirmed to be infected with the virus.

During isolation observation and treatment, Li refused to implement prevention and control measures, which caused the virus to spread to unspecified personnel, causing serious consequences.

After she was cured and discharged from the hospital on Feb. 3, Li was put under coercive measures by the police.

Other similar cases have also been filed for investigation across the country.

The MPS called on those who know that they have been infected or may be infected with the virus to seek and receive medical treatment in a timely manner, quarantine themselves at home and be responsible for the safety and health of themselves, their families and others.
