A team of Chinese businessmen in Kenya donated supplies to help China fight the deadly coronavirus.

Just a day later, the medical supplies sent by the Kenya Chinese Chamber of Commerce arrived safely in Wuhan, and were received with gratitude.

The supplies were meant to be delivered to two of the main hospitals leading the fight against the virus.

Jiangxia hospital received 3,695 masks, as well as 40,000 disposable surgical masks, while over 149,000 disposable surgical masks and other supplies made their way to Dongxihu hospital.

More deliveries are expected to reach China in due course, including a new batch of medical supplies.
