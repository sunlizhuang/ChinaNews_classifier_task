Feb 6 (Reuters) - Copper prices rose on Thursday, fueled by worries over a potential supply shortage of refined metals, as the industry started to feel the impact of transport restrictions in China amid efforts to contain a virus outbreak.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose

as much as 1.3% to $5,797 a tonne, its highest since Jan. 27,

while aluminum advanced 0.6% to $1,727 a tonne and zinc

increased 1.1% to $2,238 a tonne. "Not only is the demand side impacted, but also the supply side," said a metals analyst based in China, who cannot be identified because of company policy. "If the outbreak situation does not improve, some smelters may consider cutting production," the analyst said, adding that aluminum and zinc were also affected by the same concerns. Some container ports in China are congested with less working labor amid the outbreak. The most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures

Exchange rose 1.3% to 46,010 yuan ($6,601.24) a tonne,while aluminum climbed 0.3% to 13,655 yuan a tonne,zinc edged up 0.3% to 17,350 yuan a tonne.

"All my previously booked vessels out of China have to be postponed," said a trader in Singapore. "Nothing can be guaranteed now, even the new shipment schedule. I am not the only one getting affected." Output of China's copper smelters could fall by more than 15% in February from last month, while zinc production could also drop if transport restrictions are not eased soon, said research house Antaike.
