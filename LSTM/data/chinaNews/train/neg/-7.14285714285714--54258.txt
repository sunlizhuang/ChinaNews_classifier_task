Dozens of people will be quarantined at a Nebraska National Guard site for possible coronavirus.

Ashland Fire Chief Mike Meyer tells 6 News that 70 people who recently returned from China will stay at Camp Ashland, where they will be tested for possible exposure to the virus.

Meyer says 70 medical staff will be brought in to monitor the people. Ashland officials were notified of the arrivals Monday night by Emergency Management.

6 News reports one Nebraska man is among those who will spend two weeks in Ashland. The fire department posted to its Facebook page that those quarantined at Camp Ashland "will be housed and kept completely segregated from all staff," adding that the local department would not be affected by the quarantine operations.

The Americans who may be quarantined in Nebraska are federal and contract workers who may have interacted with the virus and/or visited Wuhan, China, but tested negative for the virus.

The federal government is requiring anyone who returns to the U.S. from China's Wuhan province to be quarantined for 14 days.
