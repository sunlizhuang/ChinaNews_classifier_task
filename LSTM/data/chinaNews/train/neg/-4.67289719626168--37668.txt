A new strain of the coronavirus has killed at least 170 people in China.

Health authorities think the flu-like virus moved into the human population from an infected animal at a market in Wuhan, China.

"Anytime you're in a situation where you have a lot of people and a lot of humans in close quarters, you have animals in close quarters, you have lots of mixing, there's a potential spread," said Kathleen Winter, an infectious disease epidemiologist at UK.

There are at least five confirmed cases of the illness in the U.S.

Countries and businesses have banned travel to China. Now the University of Kentucky is restricting travel to the country.

In an email to the university, UK President Eli Capilouto said students will not be permitted to travel to China at this time.

"We have a number of faculty who have research programs or they're doing research in China. We have a number of universities we have partnerships with where students are taking classes in China or students are taking classes here," said UK Spokesperson Jay Blanton.

All non-essential travel to or from China will not be approved.

There's no timeline of when the restrictions will be lifted.

The Kentucky Chinese American Association has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for people in China impacted by the coronavirus.

The money will go towards face masks, coveralls, and other protective gear for medical staff.
