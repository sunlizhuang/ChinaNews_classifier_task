Chinese lawmakers on Monday started deliberating a draft decision on thoroughly banning illegal wildlife trade and eliminating the bad habits of eating wild animals to safeguard people's lives and health.

The draft decision was submitted to Monday's bimonthly session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top legislature.

The draft, consisting of eight articles, focuses on the prominent problem of some people recklessly eating wild animals.

It aims to completely ban the eating of wild animals and crack down on illegal wildlife trade before relevant laws are amended so as to provide a strong legislative guarantee for safeguarding public health and ecological security.
