Canada’s chief public health officer says officials are tracking down airline passengers and others who were in close contact with the first person in the country detected with an emerging virus that originated in China.

During a press conference Sunday, Dr. Theresa Tam said that the man had mild symptoms when he flew from Wuhan to Guangzhou, China, and then on to Toronto.

He was admitted to hospital a day after arriving on a China Southern Airlines flight on Thursday.

Officials say he’s in stable condition in isolation.

Tam says officials are locating passengers who were within a 2-meter radius of the man’s seat or anyone who may have served him.

Tam also cautioned that more cases could be expected to show up in Canada.



Despite her concession she adds close, prolonged human-to-human contact is usually necessary for the disease to spread.



There are more than 19 hundred and 75 cases so far in the world, including three in France and two in the United States.



At least 56 people have died of the virus in China.
