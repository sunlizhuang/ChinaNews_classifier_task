SYDNEY: Australia will start screening arrivals from Wuhan for a new strain of coronavirus that's been infecting hundreds of people across the central Chinese metropolis, the nation's chief medical officer said on Tuesday (Jan 21).



Professor Brendan Murphy said the screening was a precaution, but there was no need for alarm as the risk to the Australian public from the virus was relatively low, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.



There are three direct flights a week from Wuhan, where the pneumonia was first identified in December, to Sydney. Each of these flights will now be met by biosecurity staff.



"No international travellers have yet been confirmed as having this coronavirus in Australia and we already have well-established existing biosecurity measures at the border," Murphy said at a press conference, as cited by AAP.



Chinese authorities said on Tuesday a fourth person had died in Wuhan from a new strain of the virus which can be transmitted person to person.



Since the virus was detected in Wuhan in December, it has spread to more than 220 patients in several Chinese provinces as well as in Thailand, Japan and South Korea.



Murphy said that although the risk is low, the country does need to "keep a precautionary and active surveillance of the situation."



The most common symptom of the virus, which leads to pneumonia, is a high fever and difficulty breathing. It has an incubation period of about one week. - dpa/Asian News Network
