A leading health official from China has come forward to announce that the newly identified virus that originated in central China has now spread between humans. This disease is concerning authorities because how quickly it's been transmitted around not only China, but across Asia as well.

So far this disease has already infected more than 150 new patients.

Coronavirus can be transmitted by human-to-human interaction and if caught can cause a potentially deadly pneumonia. The virus has already claimed three lives. Officials believe the number of victims taken by the disease is likely to rise due to the annual Lunar New Year holiday.

One of China's most highly-regarded epidemiology experts, Zhong Nanshan, is using her platform on China's Central Television program to urge citizens to be careful, stay informed, and heavily cited the risk of human-to-human transmission.

“Right now is the time when we should increase alert,” said Dr. Zhong.
