The United States Department of State warned Americans on Thursday to not travel to China due to ongoing fears of the coronavirus, which has taken the lives of 213 Chinese citizens.

The CDC confirmed on Thursday a sixth US case of coronavirus, marking the first person-to-person case within the US.

The warning came just hours after the World Health Organization issued an emergency over the coronavirus.

The State Department issued a statement on Thursday:

"Do not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. On January 30, the World Health Organization has determined the rapidly spreading outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice. Commercial carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China.

"Those currently in China should consider departing using commercial means. The Department of State has requested that all non-essential U.S. government personnel defer travel to China in light of the novel coronavirus.

"In an effort to contain the novel coronavirus, the Chinese authorities have suspended air, road, and rail travel in the area around Wuhan and placed restrictions on travel and other activities throughout the country. On January 23, 2020, the Department of State ordered the departure of all non-emergency U.S. personnel and their family members from Wuhan. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Hubei province."

A "Do Not Travel" order is the highest of the State Department's advisory levels.
