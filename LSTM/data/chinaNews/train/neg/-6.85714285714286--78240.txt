China has revoked the press credentials of three journalists of the Wall Street Journal after the newspaper declined to apologise for a column that called China the "real sick man of Asia", the foreign ministry says.

Spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily briefing on Wednesday that Beijing made several representations to the paper over the column.

China criticised it as racist and said it denigrated its efforts to combat the coronavirus epidemic.

The paper had failed to apologise or investigate those responsible, Geng said.

The action comes after the United States said on Tuesday it would begin treating five major Chinese state-run media entities with US operations, including Xinhua News Agency, China Global Television Network and China Daily Distribution Corp the same as foreign embassies, requiring them to register employees and US properties with the State Department.

Geng told reporters that China opposed the new rules and Beijing reserved the right to respond.
