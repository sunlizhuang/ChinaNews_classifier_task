NEENAH, WI (WTAQ-WLUK) - A Neenah family is set to be back on U.S. soil.

Daisy, Abigail and Adalynn Roth have been stuck in Wuhan, China amid the coronavirus outbreak.

On Tuesday, Samuel Roth told FOX 11 his family has boarded a plane and will be flying into Riverside, California.

He said their flight was supposed to leave Monday morning, but after a delay, the flight is scheduled to leave at 10 p.m. (Wuhan time) Tuesday.

The Department of Homeland Security says people coming from Wuhan will be quarantined for up to 14 days.
