New Delhi: As fears of dangerous Coronavirus, that has claimed lives of 134 so far, gripped the entire world, airlines in India have started taking precautionary measures. IndiGo has suspended its flights on the Bengaluru-Hong Kong route from February 1 and on the Delhi-Chengdu route from February 1 to 20.

"Due to China travel restrictions, we have seen a high number of cancellations from China on our Delhi-Chengdu route and vice versa. Therefore, we are suspending our flights between Delhi and Chengdu from February 01, 2020 until February 20, 2020. We are also suspending our Bengaluru- Hong Kong flight effective February 01, 2020," IndiGo said in a statement.

Air India has said that it will suspend its Delhi-Shanghai flights from January 31 to February 14. The national carrier operates this flight six times weekly. However, the airline's Mumbai-Delhi-Hong Kong daily is not being cancelled. Air India, on the other hand, has advised all its cockpit and cabin crew, who travel to South East Asian cities, to wear N95 masks.
