So far, nearly 900 passengers arriving on direct flights from China have been screened for coronavirus at Budapest’s Liszt Ferenc Airport, the facility’s communications chief told a press conference on Wednesday.

Katalin Valentinyi said that passengers from China are tested for fever, and persons with a body temperature of 38 C or higher are isolated for further testing. Once infection is suspected, airport emergency staff disinfect the aircraft and all areas the patient has been in contact with, she added.

Of the 900 passengers checked, one person had a fever higher than 38 C, but the person proved to be uninfected, Valentinyi said.

Chief public health officer Cecília Müller said that her authority is in close cooperation with the airport and provides staff for screening. Isolation of a passenger is ordered by joint decision of a doctor, a public health officer and an epidemiology inspector from the government office, she added.
