House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is under fire for a “deliberate” attempt to “upstage” President Trump as he signed “Phase One” of a long-awaited trade deal with China.

Pelosi chose to announce the impeachment managers for Trump’s upcoming Senate trial at a press conference at the Capitol on Wednesday, just before the president signed the “historic” US-China trade deal at a ceremony with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.

Fox Business host Stuart Varney slammed Pelosi for what he says is her intentional attempt to distract from what Trump has touted as a “very large and comprehensive” deal following a nearly two-year-long trade war with China.

“The timing is deliberate,” Varney said on Wednesday.

“The Trump-hating media will breathlessly report on the Trump-haters who will present the impeachment case. Across most of the media, that’s a given,” Varney continued as criticism of Pelosi poured in on social media.

The biased media never see anything that the president accomplishes as being any good, Varney argued, saying that reports about the impeachment and Pelosi’s press conference will “divert attention” from the president’s historic win.

“If it does look like a Trump win, block it out, change the subject,” Varney said. “We showed you the bias: Network news broadcasts gave overwhelming coverage to impeachment –- virtually nothing to the booming economy.”

Pelosi’s ploy was quickly called out online.

@seanhannity @IngrahamAngle Looks like Pelosi held the articles because she knew the China trade phase one was being signed today. She is trying to cover it up. — colby fuson (@stashattack85) January 15, 2020

The Democrat leader was blasted as “petty” and un-American.

Pelosi knew full well the China Phase 1 trade deal was being signed today so she’s delivering the impeachment charges to the Senate today in a deliberate attempt to distract from this achievement. How small, petty and unAmerican of @SpeakerPelosi to do so. — djones (@djones68288710) January 15, 2020

Pelosi unveiled the impeachment managers, saying that the “emphasis is on litigators.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler were named and will likely lead in the Senate trial as Democrats seek to prosecute the impeachment case brought by the House against Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

These are the impeachment managers who will prosecute case against President Trump • Adam Schiff

• Jerry Nadler

• Hakeem Jeffries

• Jason Crow

• Val Demings

• Zoe Lofgren

• Sylvia Garcia https://t.co/xQgyFixIqs pic.twitter.com/IBfQWzpQww — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) January 15, 2020

The others named by Pelosi included California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, Rep. Val Demings of Florida, Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado and Rep. Sylvia Garcia of Texas.

What a joke. @HouseDemocrats literally waited four weeks before sending #impeachment articles to the Senate. The circus is back in town! 🎪 https://t.co/FnmDJEN9IH — Oversight Committee Republicans (@GOPoversight) January 15, 2020

But Varney warned that Trump would “turn the tables” on Democrats next week as the impeachment trial begins and he will be in Davos at the annual meeting of global political and business elites.

The president “will create his own news cycle,” Varney predicted, as he will be “tweeting up a storm,” answering reporter questions and “generally dominating” headlines such as the historic China trade deal, “America’s top-performing economy, historic wealth creation,” and the “narrowing of the income inequality gap.”

Varney urged viewers to pay attention to the “real, meaningful” action upcoming in the formal signing of the China trade deal.

“The president, his cabinet, members of Congress, state governors, China’s vice premier, the commerce minister and the governor of the Bank of China,” he said. “They’ll all be there at the White House.”

Meanwhile, Pelosi’s attempt to “torpedo” the president’s accomplishment will turn out to be another Democrat dud.

The contrast is alarming: Trump making progress for Americans, Pelosi making mischief for Democrats. — StopTheMadness (@scotinstowe) January 15, 2020

House Democrats sat on transmitting the Impeachment Articles to the Senate for an entire month… BUT Today chose to transmit them over to the Senate, on the day of the China Trade deal signing. No partisan politics there, just their “solemn duty”. Pelosi is such sleaze & a drunk — Justin Pulitzer (@JustinPulitzer) January 15, 2020
