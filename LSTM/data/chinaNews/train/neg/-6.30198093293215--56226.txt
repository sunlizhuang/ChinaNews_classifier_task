Although China claimed a drop in the number of new suspected cases of coronavirus in the last two days, raising hopes that its strong measures may help to contain the outbreak, the death toll has risen to over 550.

The total number of confirmed cases crossed the 28,000 mark, Chinese health officials announced on Thursday.

The outbreak has resulted in Chinese cities being largely deserted, with tourist attractions shut and a few eateries requiring temperature checks and masks.
