Coronavirus vs. flu

Definition: Both coronavirus and flu are categories. The coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 is a new strain of the virus – COVID-19.

Symptoms: Coronavirus and flu symptoms are similar – runny nose, cough, sneezing and then chest congestion.

Prevention: Both the flu and coronavirus spread from person to person through droplets in the air from an infected person coughing, sneezing or talking. The common-sense steps to contain any virus, no matter the flu, coronavirus or a common cold, are washing hands frequently with soap, covering coughs and sneezes and disinfecting surfaces.

The surgeon general does not recommend the use of masks for otherwise healthy people.

Deaths: While COVID-19 is new and a growing worldwide threat, the flu annually sickens and kills vastly more people. Almost 3,600 people had died of COVID-19 through March 7, 2020. Compare that to 646,000 flu deaths worldwide this winter and 18,000 to 46,000 deaths in the U.S. per year.
