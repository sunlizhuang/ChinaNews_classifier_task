The Chinese community is being "gaslighted" in some quarters as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, the Australian Human Rights Commission has warned, as it calls for more funding for its anti-racism work.

Race discrimination commissioner Chin Tan said on Friday he was hearing "a great deal of distress among diverse communities" as a result of the flu-like illness. "[People] are worried about being victimised and are concerned that not enough it being done to protect them by combating racism in the community," he told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.

He had heard reports of Chinese children being bullied at school, students ostracised at universities and people being denied rental accommodation as misinformation and fear about coronavirus spread.

"There are clearly some people intent on gaslighting the Chinese community at a time when it is vulnerable and suffering on the front line of the coronavirus outbreak," Mr Tan said, referring to the practice of mocking those who call out racism or making excuses for it so they come to doubt their own perception or experience.
