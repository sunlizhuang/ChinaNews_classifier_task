China supports a political process led by the Libyans under the supervision of the UN, says Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

CAIRO, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Wednesday that political dialogue is the only way to solve the Libyan crisis.

He made the remarks while attending a joint press conference with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry in Cairo, capital of Egypt.

External military intervention and the use of weapons will only aggravate conflicts and intensify confrontations, which will lead to rising tensions in Libya and make it harder to solve the problems, Wang said.

At present, the spillover effects of the Libyan crisis is on the rise and terrorist forces, such as the Islamic State, are penetrating into the country, which deserves high alert of the international community, he said.

China supports a political process led by the Libyans under the supervision of the UN, Wang said, adding that it is of the utmost importance to urge the warring parties to cease fire and return to the negociation table.

The international community should also make joint efforts to fight terrorism and prevent the expansion of extremist and terrorist forces in Libya, he added. ■
