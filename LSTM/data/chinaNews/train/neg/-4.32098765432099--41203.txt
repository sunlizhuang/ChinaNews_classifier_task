KOTA KINABALU: Marine police are hunting for fish bombing suspects believed to have operated in the protected waters off Pulau Gaya here.

Commander of Marine Police Force Region (4) Sabah ACP Mohamad Pajeri Ali said a team was sent to hunt for the suspects following a report at 3pm on Friday (Jan 31).

"Fish bombers were suspected to have hit an area near Pulau Gaya on Jan 30,” he said when contacted.

He said their officials went in to the area, and seized a pump boat and an engine among others.

“We also conducted scheduled checks at markets to find bombed fish as part of our effort to stop fish bombing activities,” he said.

According to divers at the area, they were shocked by explosions near their dive site.

This is similar to last year’s case in Semporna where a dive instructor and two Chinese tourists were killed by fish bombs.
