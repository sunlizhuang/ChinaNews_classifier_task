It's since emerged the video was shot four years ago in Palau.

"It was turned over by some accounts sponging of the heat and fanning out malicious panic," travel writer Wang Mengyun - the woman in the clip - wrote in a blog post.

While it's believed the virus made the leap from animals to humans in a food market in Wuhan, it's not yet clear exactly where it happened, or how. It took several years to trace the origin of the SARS virus to a remote cave.

You can get the virus from eating noodles, fortune cookies and Red Bull

A social media post claiming the virus can be caught by eating food from China, or popular with Chinese communities, prompted Australian health authorities to issue a rebuttal.

The badly-spelled post claimed the disease was "starting to spread in the greater Sydney region" and products such as rice, Mi Goreng noodles, ice tea, Red Bull, onion rings and wagyu beef were infected with "corona's virus".

The post cited the fake 'The Bureau of Diseasology Parramatta', claiming air tests showed the virus was circulating at train stations.

A spokesperson for NSW Health - which definitely exists - said nothing in the post was true.

"NSW Health has been made aware of a social media post that is being widely circulated warning people to not consume certain foods or visit certain locations in Sydney," a spokesperson told AFP.

"This post has not originated from NSW health or any entity relating to us. Further, there is no such entity as the 'Department of Diseasology Parramatta'. NSW Health would like to assure the community that the locations mentioned in this post pose no risk to visitors, and there have been no 'positive readings' at train stations."

None of items mentioned in the post have been recalled by the NSW Food Authority either.
