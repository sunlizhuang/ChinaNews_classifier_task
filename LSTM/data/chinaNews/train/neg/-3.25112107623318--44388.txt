MALACAÑANG on Saturday asked Filipinos to remain calm and not to discriminate out of fear over the existence of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) that originated from Wuhan, China.

Presidential Communications Operation Office (PCOO) Secretary Martin Andanar made the appeal after the coronavirus outbreak has stoked a wave of anti-China sentiment around the globe, particularly in the Philippines.





“We appeal to the public to remain calm, level-headed and compassionate as we all work toward dealing with and containing the threat of the 2019 novel coronavirus spread,” he said in a statement.

“As the issue of a viral outbreak affects everyone, let us not engage in discriminatory behavior, nor act with any bias toward our fellowmen. The reality is every one is susceptible to the virus,” Andanar added.

The Palace official urged the public “not let fears turn us against one another, especially if these fears are unfounded.”

“We must not stigmatize people, especially when they are at their most vulnerable, but emphatize with them instead,” Andanar said.

“Our country is working with other countries, their government health agencies and with international health organizations to contain the virus from spreading. Preventing the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV is not something we can do alone,” he added.

Discrimination against Chinese tourists has been reported in several countries, amid public fears of acquiring the deadly infectious disease.

Still, a temporary ban on all foreigners coming from any parts of China in light of reports that all of its regions have been infected by the 2019-nCoV has been recommended to Malacañang by Senate President Vicente Sotto 3rd.

Sotto on Saturday said the restrictions should not only cover Chinese citizens since other nationalities have also been traveling to and from China.

Flights from China do not only have Chinese people aboard, there are other nationalities on these flights and they, too, should be barred from entering our country, he added.

“The virus does not discriminate whom it will affect. It can affect anyone,” Sotto said.

“Our country cannot take this lightly because anyone can catch the virus without them knowing it, like the case in Germany. A traveler from China who did not know that he had the virus infected a German. The government should take all the necessary precautions to ensure the safety and health of our people,” the senator added.

Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri also joined the call urging for a wider temporary travel ban covering mainland China.

This call coincided with the World Health Organization’s declaration of the novel coronavirus outbreak as a global health emergency.

Singapore, Mongolia, North Korea, Pakistan, Italy, Israel, Australia, and the Caribbean countries of Dominica, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and many others have already banned arrivals from China in light of the international outbreak.

“We need to step up our quarantine measures and safeguard our people and put a temporary restriction on entry for all those coming from China to protect our people from the virus. There are confirmed cases all over China, we need to take that in mind. A temporary China-wide travel restriction is a necessary precautionary measure. We already have one confirmed case, after all. We cannot afford more,” Zubiri explained.

“I don’t believe that our friendship with China will suffer as they fully understand the need to control the spread of this deadly virus. As a goodwill gesture, we can offer to extend the visa of Chinese visitors already here before the crisis and who don’t want to go home to avoid the catching the disease,” the majority leader said.

“As soon as the threat is gone, we will gladly reopen our doors,” Zubiri added. “But until then, the safety of our people should be our priority.”

Bayan Muna Rep. Ferdinand Gaite said the temporary ban should cover Chinese vessels entering the South China (West Philippine) Sea because the nCoV could enter through the country’s backdoor.

The fast-spreading 2019-nCoV has killed more than 200 people and infected nearly 12,000, the Chinese government announced on Saturday.

The disease, which manifests as fever and cough and causes difficulty in breathing, has reached beyond Chinese borders, with confirmed cases in other parts of Asia, North America and Europe.

On Thursday, the Philippines confirmed its first case — a Chinese woman from Wuhan, who arrived in the country on January 21. She is currently being treated at the San Lazaro Hospital in Sta. Cruz, Manila.

Malacañang on Friday announced a ban on travelers coming from Hubei province, while other countries have completely shut out those coming from all of mainland China.

Sen. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go, President Rodrigo Duterte’s former top aide, suggested the possibility of imposing a temporary ban on travelers from other affected areas with confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV.

“We are not discounting the possibility of temporarily banning the travel of those from other areas who are also affected by the coronavirus,” he said in a statement.

“This travel ban should last until there is no more threat to the health and welfare of our people. I support this and other necessary measures to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus in the country,” Go added.

The senator said the Duterte administration had taken the threat of the nCoV outbreak seriously and that the President was in constant communication with key officials who are currently assessing the country’s situation.

“We will do what is needed to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. Rest assured that the Duterte administration takes this threat seriously. I am appealing to the public to cooperate with authorities in order to ensure the safety of everyone,” he added.

Go said the government was ready to deploy aircraft to ensure the safe return of Filipinos in Wuhan who have signified their intention to go home amid the 2019-nCoV outbreak.

“So far. 40 have signified that they want to go home, however, we still need clearance from China. If they are allowed to go out [of China], the government is ready to fetch them… we can send aircraft, the government is prepared to help,” he added.

Go said the Philippine government could start repatriation of the Filipinos in Wuhan next week once given permission by the Chinese government.

“The government is committed to secure Filipinos who are at risk in areas affected by the virus, but at the same time, ensure that those in the country will not be put at risk,” he added.

Needless ban

But an opposition lawmaker said Duterte’s travel ban order was unnecessary because the subject area had been locked down.

Albay First District Rep. Edcel Lagman suggested that the Philippine government should also ban flights to and from the entire Chinese mainland, including Hong Kong.

“The health and safety of Filipinos must be paramount over diplomatic niceties, tourism revenues and income of Philippine airline companies,” he said.

He added that the ban must also include the arrival of Chinese and other tourists from China in cruise ships and other vessels.

The lawmaker urged Philippine Airlines and the Cebu Pacific to suspend all flights to and from China and Hong Kong.

“They should stop servicing selective Chinese destinations and put on hold the current policy of merely reducing flight frequency,” he said.

Lagman commended personnel of the Bureau of Immigration for manning airports and seaports despite the hazard of being contaminated with the novel coronavirus.

“Recognition must also be given to Filipino medical professionals who risk their own health and safety in ministering to suspected 2019-nCoV carriers,” he said.

Concerted effort

Andanar said the Duterte administration was already coordinating with other countries and their government health agencies, as well as with international health organizations to contain the 2019-nCoV.

“Preventing the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV is not something we can do alone,” the Palace official added.

“Let us not resort to panic, sow fear-mongering or spread misinformation. Solidarity, empathy and cooperation are what we need to successfully take actions that will overcome this health concern,” he said.

Andanar advised the public not to hoard face masks and create an unnecessary scarcity that may prevent others, including health workers and sick people, from protecting themselves against the virus.

He guaranteed that there was a “concerted effort” from government agencies to implement necessary precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus to many parts of the Philippines.

“With the first case of 2019-nCoV confirmed yesterday (Thursday) and the World Health Organization, having declared the virus as a public health emergency of international concern, we have intensified our preventive and control measures. It is a concerted effort being taken by our different agencies, to ensure that an outbreak is avoided,” Andanar said.

Task force vs nCoV

According to the PCOO chief, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) has already advised local government units (LGUs) to create their respective Coronavirus Task Force, which will ensure that local health authorities have the necessary equipment and are trained in the prevention, control and containment of the 2019-nCoV.

“The Task Force will ensure that local health authorities have the necessary equipment and gadgets; that local health workers are trained in the prevention, control and containment of the coronavirus; and that those suspected of nCoV are referred and transported to Department of Health-designated coronavirus referral center or hospitals,” he said.

Through Memorandum Circular 2020-018, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año cited a provision in the Constitution stating that LGUs are in charge of the promotion of health and safety within their jurisdictions.

“As such, they must take the lead in the prevention and control of the coronavirus at the local level,” Año said in a statement.

“We need to be preventive now that there is a confirmed 2019 nCoV case in the country. Our governors, city and municipal mayors and DILG regional directors must ensure that the coronavirus will not thrive in their backyards,” he added.

Unless properly addressed, Año said the crisis could have “adverse impact” on business productivity, tourism and mobility of people, and could even lead to death.

To stop the crises from getting worse, he pointed to the importance of information dissemination to the public as false news could put the public’s health in jeopardy.

“In extreme situations, lack of information or disinformation on coronavirus may even lead to social unrest in a community,” Año said.
