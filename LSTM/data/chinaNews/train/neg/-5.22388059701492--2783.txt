China has reacted to the missile attacks launched on US bases by Iran on Wednesday.

It urged restraint from all sides, saying it would play a “responsible role” in helping to defuse tensions.

Foreign Ministry Spokesperson, Geng Shuang, said at a regular press briefing, “It is not in the interest of any party that the situation in the Middle East worsens further.”

Geng added that China would “play a responsible role in promoting a de-escalation of the situation as soon as possible.”

Meanwhile, Iran-backed Iraqi militia commander, Qais al-Khazali, has declared that it was now time for Iraq to launch its own attack on US as well.

According to him, Iran had made its initial response for the US killing its top general, Qassem Soleimani and it was time for Iraq to also express its anger on America.

Khazaili said that Iraq’s response will not be lesser than that of Iran.

Khazaili, who’s the leader of the Asaib Ahl al-Haq group, which the US has designated a terrorist organisation, tweeted, “The initial Iranian response to the assassination of the martyred commander Soleimani has happened. Now it is time for the initial response to the assassination of the martyred commander Muhandis.

“And because Iraqis are brave and zealous, their response will not be any less than that of Iran’s. That is a promise.”

The killing of Iranian army General, Qassem Soleimani has heightened tensions in the Middle East after US President Donald Trump gave reasons for his administration’s action.

Iran had vowed severe retaliation.

More than a dozen rockets were fired at two Iraqi military bases hosting US troops on Wednesday.
