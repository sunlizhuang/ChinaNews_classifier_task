Financial rating agency Fitch warned on Friday that the worsening coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan, China, could expose the economies of Macau and Hong Kong, which already have a negative outlook.

If the Wuhan viral outbreak increases sharply, macroeconomic effects will initially be most felt in Asia, where the virus originated, Fitch said in a statement sent to Lusa. Activity in the service sector, particularly in tourism-related areas, would be the most vulnerable.

That could leave exposed economies such as Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore, in addition to Hong Kong and Macau, which both already have negative economic prospects, Fitch said.

The scale of the coronavirus outbreak would, however, need to increase substantially to have a significant impact on credit ratings, the agency made clear.

The death toll in China from the outbreak of coronavirus detected in the city of Wuhan, in the centre of the country, on Friday rose to 26. The total number of confirmed cases rose to 830.

Macau’s economy is already in recession, due to faltering economic growth in China, the trade war between China and the US and the dip in investment prompted by uncertainty over the end of gambling licences in 2022.

Neighbouring Hong Kong, one of the world’s leading financial centres, is also in recession after more than six months of pro-democracy protests.
