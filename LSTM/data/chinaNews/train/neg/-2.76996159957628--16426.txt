BEIJING, China — Government officials are introducing measures to eliminate single-use plastics in China’s major cities by the end of this year, according to reports.

The New York Times reports that as part of the new guidelines, China will stop importing plastic waste and will ban the use of plastic bags. Single-use straws and plastic utensils also are being phased out, NBC News reports.

Further bans on garbage-producing plastics will take effect by the end of 2022 in Beijing, Shanghai and wealthy coastal provinces, the Times reports. The ban could be nationwide by 2025.

“China has used too much plastic,” William Liu, senior consultant at energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, tells the Wall Street Journal. “Everyone is calling for more environment-friendly development.”

The nation also intends to stop production of non-reusable plastic bags, NBC News reports. An official with Greenpeace East Asia tells the Journal the nation’s rules on enforcing the bans remain vague. Government officials say the country is serious about enforcing the new regulations, the Times reports.

The Times reports Chinese residents generally produce less plastic waste than Americans, but China’s landfills are poorly managed and the garbage often ends up out the in the open. It’s estimated 1.4 billion people live in China.

The effort to scale back single-use plastics is increasing worldwide.
