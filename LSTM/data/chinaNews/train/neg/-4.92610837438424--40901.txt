The Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has again updated its travel advice to China in light of the health emergency prompted by the spread of a deadly new strain of coronavirus.

"In view of the spread of the new coronavirus outside China and the reported cases in Asia, Europe and other parts of the world, the Foreign Ministry has updated its travel warning and asks for general precautions," the latest update says.

"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs urges travelers not to travel to Hubei province and to assess the need to travel to China. Several airlines have suspended or reduced flights to and from this country. The Chinese authorities have imposed restrictions on movement in some parts of the country. Public transport (airport, railway, bus stations) stopped in Wuhan on 23 January. Road restrictions are also in place in other cities in Hubei Province. We also encourage travelers to follow the local authorities' instructions," it said.

Information on precautionary measures is available on the website of the Center for Disease Prevention and Control.

Any travelers from China who have experienced the symptoms of this infection (fever, breathing difficulties) during or after their return to Latvia are encouraged to seek medical advice and information about their travel and contacts.
