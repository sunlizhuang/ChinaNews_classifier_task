A Chinese visitor in Myanmar suspected of having the coronavirus was hospitalized on Friday in the city of Yangon, according to officials.

A China Southern Airlines flight carrying 79 passengers arrived in Yangon from Guangzhou, China.

A 56-year-old male Chinese passenger was found to have symptoms related to the virus and was taken to the hospital, according to Soe Paing, the general manager of Yangon International Airport.

"Authorities haven't allowed the other 78 passengers to disembark the plane," he told Anadolu Agency.

According to the Department of Civil Aviation (DCA), only two Myanmar passengers will be allowed to disembark the plane.
