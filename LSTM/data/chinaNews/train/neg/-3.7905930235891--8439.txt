BANGKOK, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul on late Tuesday paid a visit to a Thai hospital to see a Chinese woman who was being treated with the new coronavirus.

Anutin, Dr Sukum Kanchanapimai, permanent secretary for the Ministry of Public Health, and Dr Suwannachai Wattanayingcharoenchai, director-general of the Ministry's Department of Disease Control, went to the airborne infection isolation room where the woman was treated at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute at Bamrasnaradura Hospital in Nonthaburi Province, a province adjacent to Bangkok.

Anutin said that the Chinese patient showed signs of improvement, had slept well and did not show symptoms of fever.

If the Department of Medical Sciences and Chulalongkorn University's Faculty of Medicine both confirm that the Chinese patient is free of the virus, she will be discharged and will return to China, Anutin said.

"We have earlier detected that three other Chinese people from Wuhan had a fever but were not infected with the new coronavirus," said Anutin, "If they recover, they will be discharged and can continue their tour in Thailand."

Anutin told the Thais that there is nothing to panic about.

There is neither cure nor vaccine for the disease; patients are treated according to their symptoms so that their bodies can develop immunity, said Anutin.

The lady tourist from the city of Wuhan of China's Hubei province was the first person in Thailand infected with coronavirus. Enditem
