HOSPITAL IN 10 DAYS

A 60,000-square-metre structure with space for 1,000 beds and 30 intensive care wards, all built in just 10 days. According to Chinese state media, the construction of a new hospital in virus-hit Wuhan has been completed – just a little over a week after it began.

A team of 7,000 carpenters, plumbers, electricians and other specialists worked around the clock to build the Huoshenshan hospital, Chinese state media said, with construction beginning on January 23 and completed on Sunday.

The hospital, which will be staffed by around 1,400 army medics dispatched to Wuhan, began treating its first patients on Monday.

Wuhan, a city of around 11 million, has been on lockdown since January 23 after it became the scene of the first outbreak of the previously unknown form of coronavirus – a group of illnesses that includes SARS.

A second new hospital is currently under construction in Wuhan and set to be completed soon.
