China's coronavirus outbreak looks worse than the Chicoms are admitting

Communist regimes are famous for concealing inconvenient information and that appears to be the case in China with the spread of the coronavirus, a SARS-linked pneumonia-like flu that reportedly has killed 26, infected nearly a thousand, and spread to to more than a half a dozen countries beyond China, including the U.S. The Chinese have got 20 million people on lockdown in Wuhan and several cities near it, just as the Chinese New Year begins, which is the entire region's biggest holiday. It's pretty obvious the epidemic is spreading anyway. Officials, culpably or not, closed the barn door after the horse got out. According to the Associated Press: China’s National Health Commission said the confirmed cases of the new coronavirus had risen to 830 with 25 deaths. The first death was also confirmed outside the central province of Hubei, where the capital, Wuhan, has been the epicenter of the outbreak. The health commission in Hebei, a northern province bordering Beijing, said an 80-year-old man died after returning from a two-month stay in Wuhan to see relatives. The vast majority of cases have been in and around Wuhan or people with connections the city. Other cases have been confirmed in the United States, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Thailand. Singapore and Vietnam reported their first cases Thursday, and cases have also been confirmed in the Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macao. Here's the evidence that they're concealing just how bad it is: First, whether through incompetence or design, they've seemingly ignored their obligation to set up safety measures, described below. Worse still, they have destroyed the evidence of the disease's origin by scrubbing out the market for exotic food that is the top suspect in the virus's origin, making it now practically impossible to trace,

Praying for no more loss of life, but that this crisis end up spurring up the downfall of Chinas communist regime.



To: SeekAndFind

This came from a bioweapons..uh..research lab in that Province. It’s not from some animal in a market that just happened to be infected by nature... Origin is the research lab..



To: SeekAndFind

The CHERNOBYLvirus.



To: RummyChick

Really?



To: SeekAndFind

I think it’s a lot worse than the Chicoms are letting on, they have around 10 cities and over 30 million people quarantined....the entire State of Florida has less people and what is been quarantined in China....



To: CondoleezzaProtege

They don’t admit it yet. This will be a strong version of something in nature since it came from a bioweapons lab.

21st Century equivalent to the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918. While it did not wipe out the human race, there was certainly a crimp in population lasting for perhaps more than a generation. China alone could lose more than a hundred million people if this as dread as it is being made out to be. Imagine if it got loose in Africa in addition to all the other highly infectious diseases that lurk there.

This seems to be popping up in various cities in the US. People are going to panic due to fear.



To: RummyChick

It’s a SARS variant IIRC

Judge it by their actions, not their words. If they are quarantining entire cities, there is something going on.

The latest media event to take the focus off of the Bidens and the charade in the senate. /s

Sure seems like it.

Wow, who’da thunk China would lie?!? They wouldn’t be locking down everything if it was just the common cold and the rest of the world wouldn’t be banning flights. It’s not all old people. Saw a headline on Wash Post about a young man dying but it was behind a wall so couldn’t read it.



To: RummyChick

Ed Morrissey of HOTAIR Observes: Imagine, if you will, that the US had put the state of Washington in lockdown after finding its first case of the Wuhan coronavirus this week. That wouldnt amount to a third of the population China has now locked down as they rapidly expand their quarantine of their central provinces. Thirty-five million people now cannot travel outside of the hot zone for the virus, and most of those cannot travel much within it either. Beijing has also updated its numbers of the sick and the dead, but they might still be underestimating those. Ohhh and By the way, another Coronavirus case was discovered ... IN CHICAGO!

Meanwhile, here in DFW we’ve had 11 flu-related deaths this year, the latest victim was 34 years old, and had no underlying health issues. This scares me a lot more than the coronavirus.



To: RummyChick

Origin is the research lab..

_________________ That’s my thought also. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is the first and only (as of Feb 2017) Level 4 bioresearch lab in China. Those are potentially “dual use” facilities. If Wuhan 2019-CoV is a bioengineered virus, the next question is whether this was an accident or bioterrorism (for political or financial reasons; or both)?

I love that line from The Americans. My country does not have a bioweapons program. That has been outlawed by treaty, but we do work on antidotes just in case your country has a secret bioweapons program



To: Ozymandias Ghost

Don’t know anything about China other than they cant be trusted. Hard for me to believe it would be China State sponsored terrorism. Could be somebody was paid off to release it from another country type thing.
