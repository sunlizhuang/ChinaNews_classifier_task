Beethoven, or BTHVN in the ineffably plucked version, is now being exposed to the Corona virus. The local German organizer has signed a cooperation agreement with the German national tourist board in order to promote the German BeeTHoVeN activities in Asia and beyond.

In the light of this cooperation Ralf Birkner, commercial director of the Beethoven Jubiläums GmbH, held a keynote speech in China and Japan in January for travel journalists and representatives of the tourism branch, presenting the highlights of the anniversary year 2020. This happens at a moment when several airlines, among them Lufthansa stopped flying to China. And in February Beethoven’s propaganda troops will introduce the vast program of BTHVN2020 in New York City. Americans will rave about it. Beaty age vee an’ twenty twenty. Oh man!
