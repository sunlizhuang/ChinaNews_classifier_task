They have been on holidays near the coast of China.

On January 29, two people were urgently hospitalized in Mahiliou with suspected coronavirus infection, Radio Svaboda reports.

Two citizens of Belarus, residents of Mahiliou, had a rest near the Chinese coast on the islands. This was reported by spokesman for the Ministry of Health Yuliya Baradun.

Upon their return to Belarus, they felt unwell. The Mahiliou residents made a connection in China, returning to their homeland. So they decided to go straight to the local polyclinic. They were both taken samples. Now they are being studied at the Republican Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology. The test results will be known within 12 hours.
