The shift in risk appetite overnight, caused by a jump in new CoVid-19 cases outside of China, piled more pressure on the beleaguered Aussie. Weak local data added to the downforce, pressing AUD/USD to the lowest levels in 11 years.

Australia services PMI drops below 50

The Commonwealth Bank services PMI for February fell sharply to 48.4 from 50.6 last month. Expectations were for an improvement to 52.4 but instead the index fell to the lowest level since the index started in 2018. A combination of subdued client demand, adverse weather and the CoVid-19 outbreak contributed to the lower reading.

AUD/USD felt more pressure this morning, posting incremental losses on yesterday’s drop and reaching fresh 11-year lows. The FX pair is at 0.6604 and is poised for its fourth daily loss in a row, with the March 2009 low at 0.6285.
