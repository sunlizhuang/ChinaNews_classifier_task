The suspect said that she was acting under the influence of alcohol while calling the police.

The case was revealed by the police of Wuqing, a district of Tianjin, through their social media account on Saturday.

According to an official post, Ms Ma called the police at the Hexiwu Police Station more than a dozen times on Wednesday.

She said she had downed a large volume of distilled rice wine and argued with her boyfriend, who subsequently left home.

She claimed her partner had been coughing non-stop and sustaining high fever since the night before.

Police found her boyfriend, Mr Wang, at one of his friends' house shortly afterwards.

Mr Wang did not show any symptoms when the officers met him. The police then arranged medical checks for him and he was found to be healthy.

Ms Ma was detained by police on suspicion of making false claims to police and disturbing social order.
