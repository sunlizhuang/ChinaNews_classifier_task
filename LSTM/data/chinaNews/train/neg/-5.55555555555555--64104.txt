TAIPEI (Taiwan News)  China deployed its military aircraft on Sunday morning (Feb. 9) to the West Pacific by circling half of Taiwan, said the island nations Ministry of National Defense in the afternoon, adding that the authorities had responded immediately and appropriately to the Chinese military activity.

China sent out a Shenyang J-11 fighter jet, a Xian H-6 bomber, and a Shaanxi KJ-500 airborne early warning and control aircraft at around 11 a.m, and the planes flew through the Bashi Channel and Miyako Strait  off the east coast of Taiwan  before returning to base, according to Taiwans defense authorities. They added that the military had responded to the Chinese training exercise immediately by scrambling Air Force reconnaissance and defense jets.

The ministry also released a photo of one of Taiwan's F-16 fighter jets, armed with at least one missile, flying close to the Chinese jet bomber for monitoring. The ministry stressed that the military would get full control of any situation and respond accordingly to ensure the nations sovereignty and protect the lives and property of the Taiwanese people.

Nevertheless, the ministry warned that the operation by the Chinese military impacted the regions security and stability. It called the activity an endangerment to the peace and well-being of the region.

It does sound like a warning to their own restive provinces and metro areas, doesn’t it?

here is a new story https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/nine-members-hong-kong-family-infected-coronavirus-after-sharing-meal but what does the hotpot have to do with it...this virus floats in the air. you dont need to eat from a hotpot to get it. you just have to breath



To: VAFreedom

Spreading virus?



To: RummyChick

ah yes, i saw that report from various ethnic stations today. Eating hotpot probably increased the risk as, you’re sitting family style and eating from the same pot , which may or may not use ‘public’ serving spoon

Spreading virus? Now that's just plain mean! But that's a possibility, the way the Chinese government works!



To: RummyChick

I am ignorant of Taiwanese hotpot habits. The picture suggests that its normal to use your own chopsticks to serve yourself from the communal pot. If someone has it and gets saliva all over their chopsticks then sticks it in the pot then that becomes part of the ingredients. If the food isn’t still hot enough to kill the cooties then each eats the virus with every subsequent bite.

A dumb movie less realistic than Marvel Comics adaptations that only Hollywood retards could dream up. In real life, while you’re focusing on a military expedition, your rivals have you and your family slaughtered. Dictatorships are not ant heaps where drones obey the queen mindlessly. They are gladiatorial arenas where even hand-picked subordinates are, individually, always looking for a way to remove the head honcho and take his spot. Xi Jinping was picked for promotion by Jiang Zemin for his seeming docility and lack of ambition. The first thing he did after taking power was imprison his mentor’s key men on corruption charges. Multiple Chinese rulers who waged war during difficult times had their entire clans wiped out to the tune of tens or hundreds of thousands.

"...this virus floats in the air. you dont need to eat from a hotpot to get it. you just have to breath" I believe that this theoretical mode of transmission (with a small number of actual suspicious cases) is being over-emphasized at this point. This isn't weaponized anthrax.

It is a communal pot of food where everyone is sticking their chopsticks into it to dig out a portion and dipping into sauces.



To: VAFreedom

Next week when ordered to do this they will fly them out of the county and never return, basically going AWOL.

It’s not possible to circle half an island.

Taiwan just closed shipping from the mainland?

Just add some szechuan chile sauce. That’ll kill just about anything. CC

“but what does the hotpot have to do with it.’ Especially since everything in the hotpot is BOILING. If the virus can survive boiling in the water we really are doomed

You would have preferred "Look Squirrel!" This really is no time for China to be playing chest beating games with Taiwan. Or perhaps Xi not only looks like Winnie the Pooh but is like him in other ways. A person of very little brain.
