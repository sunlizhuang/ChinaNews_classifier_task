Reports and videos out of China show a horrific picture of the chaos caused by the coronavirus, with people collapsing in the streets, troops and armored tanks deployed, and panicked doctors warning of mass infections.

So far, approximately 56 million Chinese citizens have reportedly been quarantined in over a dozen cities across China, underscoring the sheer magnitude and scale of this pandemic.

If China’s official reports of 1,400 infected and 41 dead are accurate, they sure are responding with a heavy hand: shutting down whole cities, deploying troops, and closing thousands of public attractions across the country.

Numerous videos show people collapsing in the streets and hospitals overwhelmed with infected victims.

People are literally dying on the streets of China, 20 million on lockdown, the deadly #coronavirus is spreading across the globe (now 11 countries) at unprecedented rate and WHO director just said that “each country is on its own” and “wash your hands”.

Medical professionals have been uploading videos warning of the true scale of the coronavirus pandemic, which some claim has reportedly infected 90,000 people in the city of Wuhan alone.

“Not sure if this is real or not but this is basically what she said,” a Twitter user said, attempting to translate. “She a doc in Wuhan, there are 90k cases. Virus can spread from 1 carrier to 14. All medical facilities in wuhan are low in supplies. They are running donation to get masks gloves etc.”

I just received an urgent new video uploaded by the Chinese doctor from the #coronavirus quarantine zone in Wuhan. I need your help with translation and it’s very important we get it right before it goes out to major media outlets. I’m posting it in 3 parts.

In light of these disturbing reports, questions remain: just how truly severe is the outbreak and what lengths has China gone through to cover it up?

Additionally, how will this effect the global economy and population?
