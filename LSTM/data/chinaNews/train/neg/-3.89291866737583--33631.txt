Coronavirus fears as KNH admits student

A Kenyan who flew from China yesterday has been admitted in an isolation ward at Kenyatta National Hospital in the first suspected case of coronavirus in the country. According to the Ministry of Health, the passenger arrived at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) from Guangzhou, China, and after the screening, was found to have a fever. He is said to have left China's Wuhan City - the epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic that has so far killed more than 100 people, on January 20.

Coronavirus tests are currently being conducted at the National Influenza Centre. "The suspected case remains in the isolation facility at KNH while investigations and laboratory tests are undertaken," said the ministry in a statement read by outgoing CS Sicily Kariuki.

This comes as Kenya joined other countries across the world in stepping up measures to stem the spread of the disease that has so far recorded more than 4,500 infections.

Meanwhile, work at Karimenu 2 dam in Gatundu North, Kiambu County, was temporarily interrupted after three Chinese workers said to have just flown into the country arrived at the site. Workers demanded that the three be screened for coronavirus before they were allowed to work.
