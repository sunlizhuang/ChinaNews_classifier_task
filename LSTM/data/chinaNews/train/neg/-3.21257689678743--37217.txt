A TYNEDALE family who were due to fly back home today have been left stranded in China after a flight to evacuate 200 British citizens from Wuhan was cancelled.

Jeff Siddle and his nine-year-old daughter Jasmine, from Prudhoe, were told they would be brought home today by the Foreign Office, but the flight still has not left Wuhan.

The Foreign Office said it was "working urgently" to organise a flight to the UK "as soon as possible".

Jeff and Jasmine were offered a flight home, but Jeffâ€™s Chinese wife Sindy has been told she must stay.

Although she is a British citizen, the Chinese Government say her Chinese passport prevents her from leaving the country due to fears over Coronavirus.
