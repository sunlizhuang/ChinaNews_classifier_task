The Canadian government has chartered a plane to Hanoi, Vietnam ready to evacuate more than 300 Canadians currently in Wuhan, the foreign affairs minister said during a news brief Monday.

When the Canadians arrive, they will be housed at Forces Base Trenton in Ontario for a 14-day quarantine period.

Airspace in Wuhan is closed, so we need special dispensation to fly, Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said. Furthermore, we need Chinese confirmation.

If more Canadians want to return home, the government has a second plane ready to evacuate remaining citizens.

However, if a passenger shows symptoms before getting on the plane, that person will not be allowed to fly back to Canada, Patty Hajdu, health minister, said.

Life has become difficult in Wuhan, Hajdu said, with a lockdown on the city that bars travel to school, work, stores and everyday places.

In response to the U.S.â€™ decision to declare a health emergency last week, Hajdu clarified that the same response is not needed in Canada.

Some 361 people have died from the disease while 17,205 have been infected, including four in Canada.
