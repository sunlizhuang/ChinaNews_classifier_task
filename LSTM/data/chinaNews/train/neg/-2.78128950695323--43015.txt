The Jonas family dropped off 22-year-old Nathan Jonas at the airport Dec. 30.Nathan and three other University of Cincinnati students had planned on teaching at Chongqing University for four months as part of an engineering co-op program.The coronavirus wasn't even on Nathan's parents' radar at the time."I never would've predicted this," said Nathan's mother, Leah Jonas. Two weeks in, word of the virus spread from China into the Jonas living room in West Chester.According to Nathan, the city of of more than 30 million people is now a ghost town."He said no one's in the restaurants, or no one's walking around campus. It's completely empty ... He says it's super boring. There's nothing to do because there's no one around," said Nathan's father, Matt Jonas. Leah and Matt Jonas said the boys feel fine, but there is a little concern.While Nathan and his classmates aren't in the center of the outbreak, they have traveled a bit."The fact that he did do some traveling around and was on the bullet train, that's when those germs started floating around," Leah Jonas said. "We'd like for him to be back in the United States. Like Matt was saying the other day, the hospitalization and the medical care in the United States is just tops." Not that they'll need it, but just in case."All of them feel healthy and fine, so no indication of any issues right now," Matt Jonas said. UC has canceled the co-op, and the plan is for the four students to fly to Shanghai Sunday night. "And then, Shanghai to Detroit. There may be a quarantine there, and Detroit to Cincinnati," Matt Jonas said. "I could tell by his texts over the last week, it's getting more and more like, 'OK, I just want to come home now,'" said Leah Jonas. Leah and Matt Jonas said there's no panic. They said the boys are going stir crazy more than anything, and while they're disappointed they couldn't complete the co-op, Nathan's family said they're looking at this as a life lesson -- not everything in life goes as planned.
