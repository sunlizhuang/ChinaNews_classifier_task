Britons who returned to the UK from Wuhan are preparing to spend their first night at a facility in the Wirral, where they will spend the next 14 days in quarantine.

A convoy of coaches carrying the 83 passengers travelled from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire to Arrowe Park Hospital, to face two weeks of "supported isolation".

Their plane left Wuhan at 9.45am local time on Friday, carrying the Britons along with 27 non-UK nationals, mostly from EU countries.

It comes after two people tested positive for coronavirus in England, becoming the first confirmed cases in the UK.
