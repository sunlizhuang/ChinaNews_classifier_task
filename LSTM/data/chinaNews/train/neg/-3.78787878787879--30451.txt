Sheikh Hasina asks return stranded Bangladesh citizens from China

Dhaka, Jan 27 (UNI) Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has directed her foreign ministry to initiate steps to bring back Bangladeshi citizens, who are stranded in China due to Coronavirus outbreak, state minister for Foreign Affairs M Shahriar Alam said here on Monday.

"We’ve started discussions with the Chinese government in this regard in line with the premier’s directives," Alam said in a Facebook post.

"The foreign office plans to discuss the issue with the Chinese authorities especially in the regions affected by the Coronavirus to find out ways for the return of our citizens as the Chinese authorities have enforced travel lockdowns, barring the entry and exits of people," he added.

Alam said the foreign office would issue a primary directive on Monday to prepare a list of citizens who are willing to return. :Our main purpose is the safety of our citizens," the state minister said.

Bangladesh Embassy in Beijing has already opened a 24-hour hotline to reach out to the expatriate Bangladeshis if they need any emergency support due to the outbreak.

Mr Alam said an estimated 300 to 400 Bangladeshi students were now in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus.

Bangladesh embassy in Beijing had earlier said they were in touch with the students in Wuhan.

The death toll from the coronavirus epidemic rose to 80 on Monday with hundreds of new infections reported despite unprecedented quarantines and travel lockdowns, as foreign governments scrambled to help their trapped citizens.
