New Zealand is clear of coronavirus, health officials confirmed on Thursday.

No one in New Zealand has contracted the virus or fits the definition for a suspected case.

"If and when we get a confirmed case, we will inform the public as soon as we can," said Health Minister David Clark.

Although the country is clear, the recommendations for people returning from China have changed.

Confirmed cases of the virus in China have now reached over 7000 and 170 people have died.

"Anyone travelling to New Zealand who has been in Wuhan or the Hubei province in the last 14 days should self-isolate," Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield told media.
