SINGAPORE - Singapore Airlines' budget arm Scoot has cancelled its flights between Singapore and the Chinese city of Wuhan from Thursday (Jan 23) to next Monday morning, citing the temporary suspension of all public transport in the Chinese city in the wake of a feared epidemic.

It said on its website on Thursday that eight flights during the period are affected.

Flights from next Monday afternoon are expected to operate as scheduled for now.

"Affected customers booked on these flights will receive e-mails from Scoot with further information on refunds," Scoot said on its website.

With confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus - which causes pneumonia - increasing to 571 cases and the death toll nearly doubling to 17 on Wednesday, the Chinese authorities announced that they were cancelling all flights out of the city and suspending trains, buses and ferries.

Flights arriving in Wuhan are, however, not covered by the lockdown.

Singapore's Ministry of Health on Thursday advised people to avoid travelling to Wuhan, while reminding the public to exercise caution and pay attention to personal hygiene when travelling to the rest of China.
