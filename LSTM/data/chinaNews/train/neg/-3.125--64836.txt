Malaysia Airlines MH370 was an international passenger flight operated by Malaysian Airlines.

On the 8th March 2014, the plane disappeared while en route to Beijing, having departed from Kuala Lumpur in the early morning. Flight MH370 was never found, with all 227 passengers and 12 crew abroad presumed dead.

However, that's not to say that nobody cares. Since the disappearance, several people from a number of countries have attempted to find the missing plane, something that has resulted in one of the most costly aviation searches in the world.

In fact, some of the world's most advanced technology has been used to scan the bottom of the ocean in the hope of finding the plane or at least an idea of what happened. Unfortunately, the plane has yet to be found, but the search has uncovered some remnants of the past that have to lead to some exciting yet bittersweet discoveries.
