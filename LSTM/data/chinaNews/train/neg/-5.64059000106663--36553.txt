The government is considering suspending the visa on arrival facility for Chinese tourists due to the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan, Minister of Public Health Anutin Charnvirakul said on Thursday (January 30).

A plane to evacuate Thais in Wuhan is now ready but the government is still awaiting permission from China, he added.

“I will travel by plane to Wuhan since I have been appointed by the Cabinet to take care of this matter,” Anutin said. “We will leave no one behind.”

Until now, 9,239 people around the world have been infected with coronavirus and 170 have died. Thailand is the country with the second most number of infected patients, totalling 14.
