A newly leaked document appears to show how Uighur Muslims are surveilled and sent to Chinese government camps.

This 137-page document leaked by a whistle-blower to several media outlets appears to list the details of 311 Uighur Muslims sent to China's controversial camps.

The list allegedly shows how Beijing is tracking every face, family and movement of the Muslim minority Uighurs in Xinjiang.

Reasons for detention listed include growing a beard or wearing a veil, praying regularly, having "too many" children or applying for a passport to travel abroad.

If genuine, the document corroborates several investigations which point to a large network of detention camps holding at least one million people.

China initially denied the existence of the camps, but later described them as "vocational training centres" that are necessary to help combat "terrorism".
