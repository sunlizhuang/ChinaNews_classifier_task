A decontamination exercise was carried out at Dublin's Mater Hospital yesterday after a patient was brought in with a suspected case of the Chinese coronavirus.

The woman had returned from the Asian country and had a fever, but was assessed and found not to have the virus.

An ambulance was decontaminated by staff as a precaution, according to the Irish Independent.

China's suspended flights and trains in and out of the city of Wuhanto limit the spread of the virus.

17 people have died from the deadly strain so far, which has symptoms similar to a severe cold.

The World Health Organisation says it'll decide later whether to declare a global emergency, after deferring the decision at an emergency meeting yesterday.
