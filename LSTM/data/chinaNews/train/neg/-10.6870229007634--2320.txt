Martin Patrick Toohey, 63, faced Downing Centre Local Court on Wednesday morning following an altercation with a 40-year-old woman in The Rocks

A Sydney man accused of kicking out the teeth of a Chinese crested powderpuff dog and smashing a woman's phone has appeared in court.

Martin Patrick Toohey, 63, faced Downing Centre Local Court on Wednesday morning following an altercation with a 40-year-old woman in The Rocks.

The 40-year-old woman was walking her two dogs - Sootie the powderpuff and Timmy - in early December when she sat down on a park bench.

Police say Toohey, who lives in Millers Point near The Rocks, allegedly kicked one of the dogs after they got involved in a fight with his dog.

'During that conflict, both parties tried to separate the dogs and at some stage one of the dogs of the female lost two front teeth,' police said in December.

It's alleged the woman then took a photo of Toohey, before he grabbed her phone and stomped on it.

Police alleged Toohey walked away but returned when bystanders tried to help the woman.

A scuffle then allegedly broke out between Toohey and two bystanders.

Toohey has been charged with damaging the woman's iPhone as well as behaving in an offensive manner in public.

He is yet to plead to the charges and has been bailed to appear in court on January 28.
