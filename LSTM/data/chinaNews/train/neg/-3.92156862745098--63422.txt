A New Caledonian woman has been placed in quarantine in Noumea after returning from China with a temperature.

Arriving on a flight from Tokyo, she was routinely questioned and examined over fears of the spread of the coronavirus when measurements showed an elevated temperature.

The woman, whose age has not been disclosed, was taken to a special hospital ward.

As a precaution against the virus the Isle of Pines has decided to suspend cruise ship visits.

At the start of the month, several cruise ship visits in the Loyalty Islands were called off.
