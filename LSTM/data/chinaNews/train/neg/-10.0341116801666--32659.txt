Speaking to Newstalk Breakfast this morning, he explained how a friend offered to visit him today to celebrate his birthday but he cautiously declined the offer.

He said: "It's actually my birthday today and my friend wanted to come over to celebrate and I was like 'I don't know - probably best to give it a miss for now'."

Mr Kavanagh explained how he was forced to do a "big shop" on Sunday morning so that he has enough supplies to last him for a fortnight.

'BIG SHOP'

He said: "I went out there on Sunday morning and did a big shop then, so I'm alright for maybe 10 days, two weeks or so - but after that I'll have to go back out.

"When you do see people, everyone just keeps themselves to themselves and just tries to stay away from other people.

"You're suspicious of other people, strangely - 'maybe that person's infected and they don't know it' - cause there's such a long incubation period and you can still infect others."

'LEAVING MY LIFE BEHIND'

When asked if he would leave Wuhan if he could, the Kildare man said: "The Irish Government are looking at measures right now and they've been in contact with the Irish people in Wuhan - but if I leave, I feel like I'd be leaving my life behind."

He then added: "As the days go on you get a little more worried - but I try not to worry as best I can because there's no point worrying.

"If things change in the future and if the situation gets much worse then I'll probably start to worry, but even then what's the point - what can I do to change it?"

CHINESE STUDENT IN IRELAND

Meanwhile, a Chinese student who travelled from Wuhan to Ireland was yesterday put into isolation.

The possible patient is being kept in isolation in Waterford as a "precautionary measure".

He arrived in Ireland yesterday, having left Wuhan days ago before the city was shut off.

He is not unwell or showing any symptoms at the moment, but has been quarantined to be safe.

'AS A PRECAUTION'

WIT said in a statement: "A student arrived in Waterford on Sunday having left Wuhan some days ago before the city was closed.

"He is not ill and as a precaution he has agreed not to attend college and stay in his accommodation by himself for the time being."

52 people across Northern Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland have already been tested for the deadly flu-like virus were negative, but there are fears the UK could have its first positive test "within days".
