BEIJING (AFP): Angry Chinese social media users are demanding answers after news circulated that a university student who spent less than a dollar a day on food had died despite raising thousands of dollars in donations.

Wu Huayan, who suffered from severe malnutrition and had lost both her parents, died on Monday (Jan 13), according to Chinese media reports.

The 24-year-old reportedly spent just two yuan (RM1.20) per day on food - such as rice mixed with chili peppers - in order to pay for her younger brother's medical treatment.

The university student's death has sparked furious viral discussion on Chinese social media amid mounting suspicion that donated funds had been misappropriated.

Last year over one million yuan (RM600,000) was raised after a report on Wu's malnutrition caught the attention of online users. At the time she weighed just 21kg.

But she received just 20,000 yuan for her own medical treatment last November, according to the charity that organised Wu's crowdfunding campaign.

She and her family "wanted to save the remaining money for surgery and rehabilitation treatment", explained the China Charities Aid Foundation for Children (CCAFC) in an online statement on Wu's death. - AFP
