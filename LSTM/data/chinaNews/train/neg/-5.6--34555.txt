British Airways has temporarily halted flights to and from mainland China over fears about the coronavirus outbreak that has so far killed 132 people.

The airline has suspended its daily flights to Beijing and Shanghai for the next two days “while we assess the situation,” a company spokesman said Wednesday.

“We apologize to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority,” British Airways said in a statement.

The carrier said it made the decision after the UK’s Foreign Office advised against “all but essential travel” to China as the virus spreads. British Airways is still offering trips to Hong Kong, where travelers can connect to a Beijing-bound flight operated by one of its partner airlines, the company’s website shows.

Other airlines have also adjusted their schedules in response to the virus. United is suspending two dozen flights to Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong slated for early February because demand has plummeted, and Air Canada is canceling select flights to better align expected demand with its capacity.

Both Air India and Air Seoul, a South Korean budget carrier, are stopping all flights to China. And the Trump administration is reportedly considering a ban on flights between the US and China after officials confirmed five stateside cases of the virus.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned travelers to avoid all of China because of the virus, which has infected more than 6,000 people.
