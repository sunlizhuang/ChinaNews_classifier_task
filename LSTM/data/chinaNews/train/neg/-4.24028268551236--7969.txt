SUBANG JAYA: Bukit Aman will hand over investigation papers pertaining to the arrests of 17 people, including a state assemblyman at a condominium in Puchong, to the deputy public prosecutor (DPP) once the investigation is completed, says Datuk Mazlan Mansor.

The Deputy Inspector-General of Police said police will investigate the matter thoroughly.

"We are focusing on various offences, especially the narcotics aspect.

"When all documents and evidence have been completed, we will hand it over to the DPP," he told a press conference after launching Ops Selamat, in conjunction with the Chinese New Year celebrations on Tuesday (Jan 14).

It was reported that Dengkil assemblyman Adhif Syan Abdullah and several members of two political parties were among 17 people detained, following a raid on a private party in Puchong.





According to sources, Adhif, who is the Selangor Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia Youth chief, was picked up in the early hours of Sunday (Jan 12), as the party was going on.

Sources said that besides several Bersatu members, the others detained were from PKR.

Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Abdul Hamid Bador, who confirmed the arrests, said except for one male, 16 of those picked up tested positive for drugs.

“I will not release the names of those detained, as the investigation is underway. We are also waiting for the second set of tests on the urine samples, ” he told a press conference at Bukit Aman on Monday (Jan 13).

Abdul Hamid, who declined to confirm if an assemblyman and political party members were among those detained, said police from Brickfields went to the condominium after residents complained of loud noises around 4.40am.
