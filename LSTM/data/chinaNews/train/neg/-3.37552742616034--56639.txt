Dr Suthep Phetmak, Public Health Inspector of Region 6, on Thursday (February 6) briefed the press on results of the physical examination of the 138 Thais brought back from Wuhan city of China's Hubei province, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.

The evacuees arrived in Thailand at U-Tapao International Airport in Rayong province on Tuesday (February 4).

“134 were found to be physical and mental healthy with no symptoms of the new coronavirus,” he said. “Four persons, however, displayed symptoms such as coughing and diarrhea. They were put on special monitor list and separated from others. All 138 persons did not have fever”.

Of the four under quarantine, he said, one had diarrhea and two were coughing but are slowly recovering. Only one person remains on the caution list as doctors found abnormality in their lungs during x-ray. “The patient’s lower lungs might have been infected, but doctors need to perform more tests,” he added.

All 138 Thais are bring kept at Royal Thai Navy’s facilities for 14 days after arriving in Thailand.

Meanwhile, Royal Thai Navy’s spokesman Vice Admiral Prachachart Siriwat said that the Navy will not reveal the names of those in quarantine in line with their rights. “However, people who are concerned that their relatives might be among those in quarantine can, in person, contact Aphakorn Kiatwong Hospital in Chonburi, which is the central agency dealing with Thais brought back from Wuhan”.
