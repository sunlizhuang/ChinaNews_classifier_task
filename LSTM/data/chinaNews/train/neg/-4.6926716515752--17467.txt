The World Health Organisation (WHO) has convened an emergency meeting today in Geneva to discuss the outbreak of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China that has claimed six lives and infected nearly 300 people so far.

At the meeting, the WHO will consider whether it should declare an international public health emergency over the novel coronavirus outbreak in China. In past, such emergencies have been declared during outbreaks of Ebola and swine flu, among other illnesses, which necessitated a concerted international effort.

Such a declaration, if made, will be seen as an urgent call for a coordinated international response to fears that the outbreak could spread as millions of Chinese begin travelling home and abroad for the Chinese New Year and Spring Festival holidays starting from January 24.

China's National Health Commission is also expected to release details of total cases reported so far and the number of deaths. The statement will provide an idea of the extent to which the viral infection has spread so far.

WHO's emergency meeting comes against the backdrop of China's announcement that close to 300 people have been already infected by 2019-nCoV and six have died so far. The outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan where the most number of cases (258) have been reported so far. Two cases have been reported in Thailand and one each in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.

China's top leaders have warned health officials against any cover up of the information on the outbreak.

India has already issued a travel warning and the Ministry of Civil Aviation on Tuesday ordered seven airports, including those in Delhi and Mumbai, to start thermal screening of passengers arriving from China. Several other countries have already started screening travellers coming from China, especially from Wuhan, to detect symptoms like fever.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang confirmed on Monday that Chinese officials would be attending the emergency meeting of the International Health Regulation (IHR) called by the WHO in Geneva.

Experts from countries from where the virus is reported would also attend the meeting and share the information on the epidemic and come up with scientific solution, he said. He said China has shared information with the WHO about the virus as well as the countries affected besides Hong Kong and Macau which are special administrative regions of China.

HUMAN-TO-HUMAN TRANSMISSION CONFIRMED

China's National Health Commission on Monday confirmed for the first time that the infection could be transmitted from human-to-human. It said two people in Guangdong province had been infected in this manner.

In a separate statement, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said at least 15 medical workers in Wuhan have also been infected with the virus, with one in a critical condition. The workers presumably became infected with the virus due to the contact with patients. All of them are being kept in isolation while being treated, BBC reported.

ECHOES OF SARS OUTBREAK

Chang An Jian, the official social media account of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission - Beijing's top political body responsible for law and order - ran a commentary on Tuesday, telling cadres not to forget the painful lessons of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which affected many parts of China and the world in late 2002. Over 800 people died due to the virus.

The Chinese government initially tried to conceal the severity of the SARS epidemic, but its cover-up which was exposed later has led to panic and mistrust about the government handling of the crisis.

"Anyone who puts the face of politicians before the interests of the people will be the sinner of a millennium to the party and the people," the commentary reads. "Anyone who deliberately delays and hides the reporting of (virus) cases out of his or her own self-interest will be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity," it added.

The commentary cited an instruction issued by President Xi Jinping on Monday that the virus must be "resolutely contained" and that all cadres must make "the safety of people's lives and their physical health" a top priority.
