As Australia prepares to evacuate its citizens from the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus outbreak, the New Zealand Government says it's talking to allies about how to get Kiwis out as well.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison today announced his Government was planning for an operation to remove the more than 600 Australians currently trapped in the city of Wuhan and move them to the Christmas Island detention centre for quarantine.

The region has been on strict lockdown since the outbreak of the new virus that has killed 106. There have been more than 4500 confirmed cases and there are 53 New Zealanders registered as being in the region.

"We're putting the plans in place, were working with the Chinese Government to put this in place," Morrison said.

He said he had also been speaking to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern during the day about combining resources as part of the evacuation effort.

"I spoke again to Prime Minister [Jacinda] Ardern today, I spoke to her last night, so this is very much an ANZAC operation. We will be working very closely with them."

Ardern has since confirmed the news.

“I spoke with Prime Minister Morrison again this afternoon and we have confirmed that we will work together on a joint ANZAC assisted departure of Australians and New Zealanders from Wuhan,” Jacinda Ardern said.



“Specific details of the evacuation plan, including the medical protocols that will be applied to returning New Zealanders, and access arrangements on the ground in China are being worked through by officials.”

The announcement comes as the NZ Government warns Kiwis to avoid all non-essential travel to China as the spread of the deadly coronavirus continues.
