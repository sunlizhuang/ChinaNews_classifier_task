The Cabinet has approved a decision to authorize officers of a Chinese company to assist in submission of visa applications of tourists arriving from China.

The Government noted that although the country attracts a considerable amount of Chinese tourists to Sri Lanka, a significant portion are discouraged owing to delays in obtaining a visa to visit Sri Lanka owing to the language barrier given that the Electronic Travel Authorization System (ETA) system is operated only in English.

In order to remedy the situation, it was decided to allow tourists to obtain assistance from private agencies to fill out their applications

Accordingly. Cabinet approved a proposal submitted by the Minister of Mahaveli, Agriculture, Irrigation, Rural Development, the Minister of Internal Trade, Food Security and Consumer Welfare and the State Minister of National Defense to obtain the service of Travelson International Travel Services (Shanghai) Limited, which has prossessing experience in a number of countries, to cater to this need.
