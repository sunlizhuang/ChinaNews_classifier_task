With 2020 only a few days old and Chinese New Year just around the corner, streetwear magnate BAPE is dropping some very limited gifts to celebrate.

Upon a designated amount purchased at select BAPE locations (approximately $324 USD), a 2020 Ape Head-shaped calendar can be redeemed. The calendar includes all 12 months, each featuring a different BAPE CAMO print. Themed Baby Milo stickers are also attached to mark special days such as birthdays, summer holidays and more.

In addition, to celebrate on a more traditional level, exclusive BAPE “Red Packets” will also be gifted at select BAPE locations after spending approximately $231 USD. Instead of its classic red colorway, the lucky packets have been dressed in a split pattern, showcasing BAPE‘s signature 1ST CAMO in green on one side, while the other is dressed in red and features a gold embossed Ape Head insignia. Up top, the envelope features a Shark Face logo. The pack of six envelopes will come housed in a clear plastic zipped pouch embossed with a Shark Face on one side and “WGM” (World Gone Mad) on the other.

Finally a BAPE Candy Box will also be up for grabs only at BAPE Store Hong Kong. Usually brought out during Chinese New Year, the candy box features five compartments to hold various treats to celebrate the festivities.
