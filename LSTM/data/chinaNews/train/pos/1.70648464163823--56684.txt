Rajkummar Rao and Fatima Sana Shaikh in a still from Ludo.

Fatima Sana Shaikh took to Instagram to share a new still from her upcoming film Ludo. In the picture, the Dangal actress is seen sitting on an e-rickshaw with Rajkummar Rao. The film is directed by Anurag Basu.

Fatima can be seen wearing a salwar-kameez in the picture, while Rajkummar is wearing a T-shirt and pants. His hair has a centre parting and reminds one of good old days of 90s. Sharing the picture, Fatima wrote, "#ludo @rajkummar_rao (sic)."

A few days ago, the actress shared another set of pictures from Ludo set, in which she is seen in a nighty. She is wearing a helmet and posing sexily in front of a car. In one picture, she is seen riding a scooter. She wrote, "#ludo Trying to be saxy in a nightie and a helmet."

Earlier, Rajkummar Rao took to social media to share the pictures of his looks from Ludo. Sharing the photos, he wrote, "Happy new year guys. #LUDO"

In one picture, the Made In China actor is seen in a woman's avatar. He is unrecognisable in a green lenhenga-choli. The other picture shows him on a bike with sunglasses. Rajkummar's hair in both the pictures are attracting people's attention.

It was recently that Anurag Basu took to social media to release the first poster of Ludo. Sharing the poster, he wrote, "Let's Play #Ludo......24th April 2020."

Apart from Rajkummar and Fatima, Ludo also stars Abhishek Bachchan, Aditya Roy Kapur, Sanya Malhotra, Rohit Saraf and Pankaj Tripathi, among others. Ludo hits screens on April 24.
