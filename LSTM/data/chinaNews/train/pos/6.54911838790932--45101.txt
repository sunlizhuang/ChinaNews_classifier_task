“Our continued growth is a testament to the exceptional work for our Board of Trustees, faculty and staff,” said Breerwood. “All of those individuals are committed to providing affordable and accessible higher education opportunities to those we serve. This record-breaking growth serves as justification that we are answering the needs of our surrounding communities. With several new building projects on the horizon and plans for additional programs and services, I think our best days are still ahead of us.”
