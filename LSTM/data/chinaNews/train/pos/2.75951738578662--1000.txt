WASHINGTON- U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee says members of his committee will review the U-S trade deal with Mexico and Canada, tomorrow (Tuesday). He says other committees will also have an opportunity to so what's known as a "mark-up" of the agreement. He says once that process is complete, the deal will head to the full Senate, where Grassley says it has strong bi-partisan support.

Senator Grassley the USMCA could be complete within 10 days, unless it's delayed because of impeachment, which would take a higher priority.

Grassley says the agreement will be good for agriculture in Iowa. He cites eggs as an example, noting under the agreement, eggs from Iowa will be sold in Canada for the first time.

Grassley is also talking about the Phase One agreement with China, saying he's pleased with progress but also skeptical that China will make good on its promises.

"I am skeptical about China carrying out their end of the bargain, and that's based on the fact that we had an agreement in 2011, and it didn't turn out as we anticipated," Said Grassley.

He says the new agreement appears to have better enforcement and oversight to ensure China keeps its promises.

China has promised to by 40-50 (b) billion dollars worth of agricultural products from the U.S. That is not a concrete quota, but viewed as more "open ended."
