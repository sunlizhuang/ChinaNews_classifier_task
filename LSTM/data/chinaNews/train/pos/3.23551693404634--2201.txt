DAYTON, the United States, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- China's auto glass manufacturer Fuyao Group said here Monday that it will invest 46 million U.S. dollars in new equipment at its Dayton plant, which will bring 100 new jobs to local community.

Addressing the ceremony, Chinese Consul General in New York Huang Ping said "I strongly believe that when we work together we can build up a very good relationship based on collaboration, cooperation and stability to bring the tangible fruits to benefit the people of our two countries and the world."

In an interview with Xinhua, Cao Dewang, board chairman of Fuyao Group, said he is confident of Fuyao's operation in the United States and confident of the U.S. market, and his company will continue to invest in the United States.
