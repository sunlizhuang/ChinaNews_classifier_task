WeChat rolls out paywall feature for official accounts | In In Heavy Hitters | By By Wei Sheng

WeChat announced Wednesday it is testing a new feature which allows publishers on the social media app to add paywalls to their posts.

Why it matters: WeChat is becoming one of the few online content platforms in China to move into paid content, still a niche business for the Chinese internet users.

WeChat official accounts have become one of the most important channels for Chinese internet users to get information online since it was released in 2012.

WeChat’s Official Accounts Platform houses millions of subscription accounts run by individuals, news organizations, enterprises, and government agencies. The newsletter-like format allows account owners to push a series of articles to their subscribers.

Most Chinese media don’t use paywalls to block readers from their advertising-based business models.

Analysts have said that Tencent, which owns WeChat, is trying to rebalance its financial structure by growing WeChat’s revenue after its gaming business was hit hard by tightened regulations.

Details: WeChat is testing a paid content feature for some official accounts and will give access to some “qualified” accounts owners, a WeChat spokesperson confirmed to TechNode on Wednesday.

The feature allows account owners to add paywalls to selected or all content they publish, and readers have to pay to unlock articles or subscribe to the account for a recurring fee.

Android users can pay with WeChat Pay, the app’s mobile payment method. iOS users, however, have to pay through Apple’s in-app purchase service, meaning that the Cupertino, California-based technology giant will take up to 30% as commission for each transaction, a fee known as the “Apple Tax.”

Context: WeChat, the most popular social media app in China with 1.15 billion monthly active users as of September, has stepped up efforts to monetize its services with a series of major updates.
