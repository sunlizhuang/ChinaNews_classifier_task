Luxury sportswear brand Kjus China has opened a flagship store in Beijing, incorporating a VIP lounge serving coffee and highlighting the luxury image of the brand.

Designed by 5 Star Plus Retail Design, the store features a futuristic, high-tech and luxurious ambience using cool high-end materials in metal and stone.

“We used cool, modern, and high-end materials such as metal and stone,” a 5 Star Plus spokesperson explained about the design of the store.

“Using stone elements in retail fixtures and stone-look flooring helped to create a more luxurious feeling to the store.

While Kjus stores elsewhere in the world typically use wood, the 5 Star team thought wood would not achieve a futuristic feeling in this location as it is considered something of a classic material.

“However, using wood on a smaller-scale helps to draw a connection to the Switzerland-born brand. We used a wooden background for some of the high-rack equipment, as well as wooden tables, which help to create some warmth in an otherwise cool space.”





Another important element of the Kjus China store which communicates luxury is to ensure there is enough empty space in the store, without displaying too many SKUs.”

Special lighting effects and technological advancements are used to explain product features, key products and collections.
