Yelper Caroline C., who reviewed Aloha Specialties on Jan. 21, wrote, "I settled for the Aloha bento. It comes with teriyaki steak, Korean chicken, mahi mahi and redondo hot dog, served with a mountain of rice. The steak is tender and the sauce isn't overwhelming. ... The mahi mahi is different from anything I have ever tried. ... The sauce makes it."

Yelper jeffrey l. wrote, "My go-to is the mixed plate. It comes with spam musubi (2), teriyaki beef, teriyaki chicken and macaroni salad. This time I got a side of kimchi. The kimchi was slightly sour with a hint of spice. It was perfect. "

Chop Chop Wok, located at 6812 W. Cheyenne Ave., is another top choice, with Yelpers giving the budget-friendly Chinese and Japanese spot four stars out of 235 reviews.

Yelper Xanthe Q., who reviewed Chop Chop Wok on Oct. 20, wrote, "We got home and opened up the boxes and were pleasantly surprised how much food we got. Two large portions of hot and sour and egg drop soup, one bag with appetizers, one large container of broccoli beef, one of general's chicken, one pork fried rice and an extra container of 'small' chow mein. Everything, I mean everything, was delish. Full of flavor and very fresh."

Renee B. wrote, "The great thing about Chop Chop Wok is that their prices are easy on the wallet without sacrificing flavor or portion size. For their combo special, $7.95 gets you an entree of your choice, served with either pork fried rice or lo mein, with an egg roll and crab rangoon."
