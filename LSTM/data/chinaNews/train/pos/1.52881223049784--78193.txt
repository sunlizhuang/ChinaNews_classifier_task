The January charts for book sales in China strongly reflect the reading recommendations of the national education system, as challenging news arrives hourly from this major world publishing market.

Difficult Days

N

eedless to say, a great deal of distressing news has become the recent norm from China. It’s astonishing, in fact, how much has changed since our December 2019 publication of our China bestseller charts on January 20.

At that point, we were watching the lunar new year come in, as the year of the rat lit lanterns and sent families into the streets and parks for happy annual festivities.

It wouldn’t be until January 30 that the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Health Regulations Emergency Committee would name the outbreak centered in Wuhan “a public health emergency of international concern.” And it wasn’t until February 11, eight days ago, that WHO dubbed the contagion the Coronavirus Disease 2019, or COVID-19.

Should you need updated, dependable information on the virus at this point, we’d like to recommend to you the US Centers for Disease Control’s dedicated page of resources with regular situation updates.

Here at Publishing Perspectives, we know of one Beijing-based employee at a company familiar to us who went to Wuhan to celebrate the spring festival with her family, only to find herself in a city under lockdown. We send our most compassionate wishes to our many associates and colleagues in that vast market, now undergoing such stress.

Also of concern: The Washington Post’s Anna Fifeld is reporting this morning (February 19) that Beijing has ordered the expulsion of three Wall Street Journal correspondents “in retaliation for a column headline that Beijing deemed racist, a dramatic escalation in the Communist Party’s efforts to silence criticism abroad as well as at home.” The piece in question is an opinion column critical of Beijing’s handling of COVID19, and written by another journalist–not one of the three expelled and not a journalist in China.

As the freedom to publish is critical to the world community of book publishing in lock step with journalism, we read with alarm this latest incident, which Fifeld at the Post is describing as “a clear signal from China, whose government has tightened censorship and repression in recent years.”

The Comfort of School Reading Lists

Curiously, at times like this, the institutional elements of a market’s governmental structure can provide a soothing factor of perceived normality. And we see this in our January bestsellers charts, as our associates at Beijing OpenBook point out that each year starts with the ministry of education’s recommendations for reading, relayed in curriculum materials distributed to every classroom in China.

Our colleague Rainy Liu at OpenBook says, “Along with every winter and summer vacation and the beginning of the school season, sales of recommended fiction and nonfiction books increase significantly.

“In the last two years, it has become particularly obvious that the recommended reading goes straight to the Top 5.”

So it is that in fiction we find 13 of these recommended titles in the Top 30 for January, five of them returnees to the charts, including Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series and Liu Qang’s Pioneering.

And also in the fiction category, we call your attention to two volumes of Mao Ni’s Joy of Life, a novel that originally was produced as “online literature” in 2007 and published in print in 2008. The 2019 edition is a tie-in with a television series adaptation and sales are being driven across three editions from the People’s Literature Publishing House by what’s reported to be avid viewership for the work on TV.

We’re told that China’s television-guided readership is especially fleeting, so the standing of the title can be expected to retreat quickly once the series ends its airings.

And in nonfiction, we see eight books returning to the list, including the family-fortifying Fu Lei’s Letters for Home–a title you’ll find entering the list both at No. 2 and No. 12. That happens because it’s selling in both paperback and hardback at a volume to propel it onto the list in both formats. Fu’s book is considered to be a model guide to strong family values in education and loving commitment.

Other titles returning to the list as a result of the ministerial recommendations:

The Poignant Culture of Traveling by Yu Qiuyu, ranked No. 20

Seeing Off by Long Yingtai, ranked No. 24

We Three (third edition) by Yang Jiang, ranked No. 26

Gag Reel by Li Dan, ranked No. 27

Two volumes of A Global History: From Prehistory to the 21st Century by L. S. Stavrianos, ranked No. 28 and No. 29

Below, then, are OpenBook’s overall lists from (month) of bestsellers in fiction and nonfiction, followed by its lists of bestselling fiction and nonfiction in China by authors from outside the country.

At the end of our article, as always, you’ll find notes on how the lists are constructed.

Notes on the Charts

OpenBook is a privately owned industry-data research firm based in Beijing. It functions somewhat as Nielsen and NDP do from the West, and Nielsen Book Research International has worked with OpenBook in Asian operations. With authoritative data and information resources, OpenBook is able to deliver consulting service to partners who would like to explore the Chinese book market and identify suitable partners.

Jiang Boyan LLC advises authors and right’s holders on global intellectual property and investment opportunities.

As of July 1, this data is estimated by OpenBook to represent some 60 percent of the total sales activity in China. OpenBook draws point-of-sale data from more than 7,000 bookstores in China, including a total 4,151 physical bookstores representative of all the provinces in China except Tibet, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.

Retail outlets include:

Traditional bookstores

Supermarkets

Campus bookstores

“Professional” stores, said to be small stores with a specific industrial or trade focus

Airport stores

In addition, OpenBook is drawing data from online bookstores of three main types:

The “Tmall” stores of Alibaba (Tmall is described as a marketplace of companies that create storefronts online to sell products including books)

The “JingDong” Stores of JD.com (similar to Tmall as a marketplace of both individual companies and bookstores operated by JD.com)

Ten independent online bookselling retailers

China has 500 or more publishers in operation today. Most of them, Trajectory CEO James Bryant clarifies, are government-owned. Private publishers are required to generate ISBNs for their titles from a publishing company that is government-owned—which, in other words, creates a system in which all ISBNs are in one way or another registered through government channels. The government approves each book published in China.
