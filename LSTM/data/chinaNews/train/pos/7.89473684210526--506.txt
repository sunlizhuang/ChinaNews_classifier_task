This week East Asia is our focus at Fitzwilliam College, with the Master and Development Director travelling to Singapore, while student callers telephone alumni in Hong Kong, China, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.

Baroness Morgan and Dr Nicola Jones will be visiting a number of alumni and friends of the College in Singapore, as well as colleagues at the National University of Singapore. We are delighted to have such strong and profound links to the Lion City, welcoming new students from there every year as well as supporting postgraduate students on named scholarships.

Overlapping with the visit will be the East Asia Telephone Campaign, which will take place 8 to 13 January. For alumni, this is a fantastic opportunity to relive happy memories and hear the latest updates from the College – as you know, there is always a lot going on! As for the students, they love the opportunity to hear stories of Fitzwilliam in the past, as well as show their support for the Fitzwilliam community.

Student caller Annie, who took part in the campaign last spring and enjoyed it so much she will be taking part again, described how she appreciated “valuable and refreshing insight” from alumni about her career choices, and also felt “greatly inspired by some of the outreach projects for students”.

We look forward to seeing or speaking to you soon!
