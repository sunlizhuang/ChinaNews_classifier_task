China plans to explore cooperation in specialist clinical services in Namibia as medical assistance to the southern African nation brings huge benefits to locals. The outgoing 12th Chinese medical team stationed in the country has received over 20,000 patients in one and a half years.

WINDHOEK, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government seeks to further expand cooperation in Namibia's health sector and explore cooperation in the specialist clinical services like brain surgery in the future, an official has said.

Chinese ambassador to Namibia Zhang Yiming highlighted this on Thursday when they bade farewell to the outgoing 12th Chinese medical team that was stationed in Namibia since 2018.

Zhang said China is pondering the establishment of sister hospitals between the two countries as well as provide more opportunities in training and scholarships for Namibia specialists.

"So far the Namibian nation has benefited greatly from the Chinese acupuncture services and it is one of the services that are highly in demand among Namibians," he said, adding that China also seeks to set up a medical center in the country to promote the Chinese medicine.

Speaking at the event, Namibia Health Ministry Executive Director, Ben Nangombe, also stressed that the two countries should look into other areas of specialization while praising telemedicine that was introduced last year in Windhoek by the Chinese. ■
