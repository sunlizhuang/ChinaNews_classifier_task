Martin Engineering is sending its second shipment of supplies to China, following word from their China division that their employees were in need.

“Our area VP, Yinjie Wang, reached out when the virus started,” said Janice Verbeke, global director of People and Culture for Martin Engineering. “We started talking around the Chinese New Year.”

At that time, the company’s 90 employees in the Kunshan province near Shanghai were under government quarantine because of the coronavirus outbreak and unable to work.

Verbeke said the Martin Engineering safety manager used their supplier to ship 1,500 face masks to their Kushan employees.

“They were very thankful,” Verbeke said.

The employees have been under quarantine and only allowed to leave their homes once every few days for supplies. Verbeke said the Chinese government has said workers may return to their jobs on February 24.

Just this week, Martin company officials offered the area more help, shipping much needed supplies to the local charity, Kushan Charity Foundation. The items included medical gloves, surgical hats and protective clothing for use in local hospitals and clinics. Verbeke said they are hoping the shipment will arrive this week.

“We sent whatever we could get our hands on,” Verbeke said.

So far, the news from China about their employees has been good.

“All of our employees and their families are healthy,” she said, noting that was Martin's real bottom line.
