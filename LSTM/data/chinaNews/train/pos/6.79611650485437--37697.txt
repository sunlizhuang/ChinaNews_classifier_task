Xylem Watermark was honored with the Model of Corporate Social Responsibility award during the 9th Annual China Charity Festival, held in Beijing on January 14-15. The award is in recognition of Xylem’s overall CSR performance, but highlights events implemented in partnership with China Women’s Development Foundation in October 2019.

In Chengdu, Xylem Watermark donated water supply equipment to Taoyuan village, which fulfilled the water supply needs of six residents. This is the first time that the Xylem China team conducted a product donation in China which helps amplify the social impact of Watermark initiatives and shows how Xylem China helps solve the water supply challenges in rural areas.

In Wenchuan, participants visited Wolong Primary School where Xylem donated two drinking water devices to provide students and teachers with clean and safe water. The volunteers also conducted a class on water technology and taught students how to test the quality of their water. Overall, eight Xylem employees and 224 external stakeholders were engaged.

The China Charity Festival is co-organized by more than 35 Chinese media outlets including China.com, ChinaDaily.com.cn and Jiemian. It has become an influential platform for advocating for philanthropic efforts.
