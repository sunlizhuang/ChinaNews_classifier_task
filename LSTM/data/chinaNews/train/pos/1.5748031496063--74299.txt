House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned Sunday that accepting Chinese domination of 5G networks through Huawei and other state-backed technology companies is "choosing autocracy over democracy."

"It is about putting the state police in the pocket of every consumer in these countries, because of the Chinese way," Pelosi remarked during a press conference at the annual Munich Security Conference, reports CNBC. "Why would we want to give license to the Chinese to direct the traffic on (the) information highway of the future?”

Allowing the Chinese to dominate the growing technology would mean a "big price to pay in terms of national security, in terms of economy and in terms of our values and our governance, and that is why we have bipartisan support for this position," she added. "It is not about economic advantage, it is about a values urgency: autocracy versus democracy. And we choose democracy.”

Pelosi joined Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper in warning against Huawei during the Munich conference. Pompeo said Huawei and other Chinese-backed companies are “Trojan horses for Chinese intelligence," and Esper warned in a speech about the “nefarious strategy” being used by the Chinese government.

Their comments come while the Trump administration is trying to keep Huawei from developing a larger influence among U.S. allies, particularly to keep those in the "five eyes" intelligence group, the U.S., the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand from working with the Chinese tech giant.
