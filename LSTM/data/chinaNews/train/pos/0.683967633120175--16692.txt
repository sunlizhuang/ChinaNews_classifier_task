TAIPEI. Ever Rich Duty Free has shown its support for minority groups in Taoyuan City in the lead-up to Chinese New Year on 25 January.

A team of executives and staff members, led by Ever Rich Duty Free Chairman Simon Chiang, donned yellow vests to become “love delivery men” during visits to a home for the elderly and to an orphanage on 18 January.

As reported, Chairman Chiang featured in The Moodie Davitt Report’s People of the Year for 2019. The list recognises individuals who by their deeds, attitudes and behaviour have most advanced the travel retail industry’s cause and reputation.

Ever Rich’s ‘Be a Giver’ day was inspired by its chairman’s belief that the ability and capability to help people is a blessing.

According to Ever Rich, Chairman Chiang hopes that not only his staff members are givers but that Ever Rich’s efforts will encourage vulnerable people to lend a hand as well. “Ever Rich wishes to convey the concept that they should not pity themselves; they have power to do many things,” the company said.
