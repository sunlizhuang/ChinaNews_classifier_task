On Jan.27, Liu Yingjie, a construction worker from Shanxi Province, along with his seven colleagues, drove 800 kilometers to Wuhan, in an effort to support the construction of Huoshenshan Hospital, an emergency specialty field hospital being built in response to the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. They’ve only rested four hours before going out to start work at the construction site on the hospital wards.

With an average age of 30, the eight-people team is led by Liu, who is only 28 years old.

According to Liu, his team signed an application to support the hospital’s construction work, without thinking too much about their payment. “We shall work first, and talk about the money issue later,” he said.

Liu’s father is also a construction worker, who went to Wenchuan for disaster relief in 2008, when a huge earthquake took place in the area. Liu was a school boy back then.

According to Liu, with the help of social media, he also summoned two construction teams from Xi’an to help the construction work, with ten workers in total.
