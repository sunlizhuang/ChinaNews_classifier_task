FARGO - North Dakota Lt. Gov. Drew Wrigley and other state officials will lead a trade mission that leaves for China next week.

Exports to countries like China are a vital part of North Dakota's economy, Gov. Jack Dalrymple said in a written statement announcing the mission.

"We're dedicated to continuing to strengthen North Dakota's presence in this growing market and in other growing markets throughout the world," said Dalrymple, who led a mission to China in 2010 as chairman of the trade office board of directors.

The mission will start Monday and last through March 28.

Other members of the delegation include Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring and members of the North Dakota Trade Office, as well as representatives of a number of businesses and organizations.
