Expert opinion on market rally

3: 30 PM

Commenting on today's rally, Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities said, "Indian bourses tanked on Saturday after the Budget disappointed the Street's expectations. However, as the Budget failed to provide any short-term relief, the market experienced massive carnage. This was a knee jerk reaction but as investors realized that the budget will aid in the long-term growth of the economy, the market picked up. With the Budget overhang gone, investors are breathing a sigh of relief and are back to make fresh calls. Additionally, January auto sales numbers were comparatively decent and with no other negative news, the Indian bourses saw a sudden rally today."
