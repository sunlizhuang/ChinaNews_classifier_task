Sian Clifford gets serious in a photo from her shoot with Porter, available now.

Here’s what the 37-year-old actress had to share with the mag:

On her relationship with Phoebe Waller-Bridge: “We want to keep on collaborating, because it is so easy and fluid – the dialogue we have…sometimes we don’t need to say anything…it’s done with a look. I don’t know if I will ever have that with someone else, the implicit trust of thoughts and ideas.”

On her wellness journey: “I felt deeply connected to it all immediately. That was the first time I ever meditated and the first time I ever did yoga. I loved it and got lost in that world and went and trained in nutrition, transcendental meditation, Buddhist meditation…I just sort of got buried in this alternative landscape.”

On coping with the success of Fleabag: “My big message about wellness is about consistency. It’s the tiny little 30-second show ups throughout your day that sustain you. You are your greatest brand, supporter, ally, lover, all of those things. If you can do that, you can really survive anything. Last year, if I hadn’t been in that place, it could have been extremely unsettling and overwhelming, because we never could have anticipated what happened to Fleabag last year.”
