LISA Nandy has become the second candidate to make it onto the final ballot in the Labour leadership contest.

She picked up a nomination from Chinese For Labour, on top of the endorsements she had already received from the NUM and GMB unions.

Nandy, who joins Sir Keir Starmer in making it through the nominations process, said: "As someone of mixed heritage, I'm incredibly proud that it is Chinese For Labour who have secured my place on the ballot paper.

"They do incredibly important work to ensure we are a representative and inclusive party that can truly speak for modern Britain.

"I'm now looking forward to getting out into the country and laying out my vision for reuniting the party, rebuilding trust, and returning Labour to power at the next election."

Nandy provoked outrage earlier in the campaign by suggesting the UK should “look to Catalonia” for lessons on how to defeat “narrow, divisive nationalism” in Scotland.

Her progression to the final ballot comes after Jess Phillips dropped out of the running.

Phillips announced on Tuesday that she was pulling out of the contest, saying she was not the right person to bring the party back together after its crushing general election defeat.

She said that while she would support both Starmer and Nandy among the remaining four contenders, the Wigan MP would be her "number one preference".

"I've said that right now, I can't bring the party together and that's why I have withdrawn from the race," Ms Phillips said.

"I think both Lisa and Keir can unite the party and begin the process of winning back trust with the country.

"I'll be voting for Lisa and Keir, as I think that they can do that. Lisa will be my number one preference."
