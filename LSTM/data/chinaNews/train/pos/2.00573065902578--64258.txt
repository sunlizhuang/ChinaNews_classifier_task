Pretend all you want, but we’re pretty sure the name ‘Xian Gaza’ rings a bell to you. Out of the many viral stories that have popped up through the years, the one that you might remember the most is his billboard proposal to Erich Gonzales, through which he attempted to ask her out on a coffee date. (Read about it here.)

Well, Xian is back with another proposal – this time in time for Valentine’s Day and this time for none other than newly single Nadine Lustre. In a Facebook post, Xian shares a photo of a ‘Mustang Bouquet’, which he claims is his Valentine’s gift for Nadine.

In the post, he admits to being an attention seeker since his teenage days and that he really goes all out just to get the attention of a girl that he lies, just like his effort to Ella Cruz in 2016 and his epic fail billboard for Erich last 2017. Three years later, and he is back at trying to get the same kind of attention. “This is me, this is how I express myself, this is the way I am,” he explains.

“Some people might think that this Ford Mustang is too much,” he adds, “that I’m trying to buy you off.” But he assures that that isn’t the case. “It’s just that my financial capacity at the moment is a little bit good and I believe that you deserve to be the first ever person in the Philippines to receive a “Bouquet of Mustang” as a Valentine’s gift because that’s how high I value you as a woman.”

He ends his post with: “All I want is to be your acquaintance, nothing more nothing less. Happy Valentines to you, Nadine.”

Do you think Nadine should accept his gift?
