A woman in North Korea has become the first person in the country to test positive for the coronavirus, a South Korean newspaper claimed on Friday.

The woman, who lives in the capital, Pyongyang, displayed symptoms after returning from a trip to China, the conservative broadsheet the JoongAng Ilbo said, citing an anonymous source in North Korea.

The North’s state media has not confirmed any infections. In its most recent update, on 2 February, the state broadcaster said no infections had been confirmed.

“As the chances of coronavirus spreading into North Korea increase, authorities started putting all people who had made overseas trips recently into quarantine for a certain period,” the source was quoted as saying, according to an English translation in the Korea Times. “The first patient is a woman living in Pyongyang. All people who had contact with her are being quarantined.”

The report did not give details of when the woman was diagnosed or her state of health.



North Korea has introduced several measures to guard against the disease – which has affected all of its neighbours – amid warnings that an epidemic could put an intolerable strain on its poor healthcare infrastructure.



It has suspended flights from China and Russia and closed train routes across its borders with those two countries. It has also imposed a ban on foreign tourism and suspended operations at a liaison office it runs with South Korea just north of the demilitarised zone, the heavily armed border dividing the Korean peninsula.



The country’s authorities have increased border inspections and health screenings of North Koreans returning from overseas business trips, according to the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the ruling Workers’ party.
