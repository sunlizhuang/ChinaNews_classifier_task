Smalls

Big ideas come in small packages at Small.

The current opening concept? A pizza omakase that dwarves our most nostalgic Pizza Hut experiences, going at S$500 for four people.

Small’s is located at 161 Middle Rd, Singapore 188978. Bookings for four persons can be made at smalls.as.me. New reservation dates of the upcoming month will be released on the 24th of every month.
