PAHO alerts the Americas to proliferation of coronavirus cases

Washington, Jan 28 (Prensa Latina) The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) activated its incident management system and recommended today that authorities in the Americas be prepared to detect early and care for patients infected with the new coronavirus. Given the possibility of receiving travelers from countries where there is transmission of the virus, 'health services must be prepared because they will most likely be the point of entry where cases of the new coronavirus will be detected,' said the director of the health entity, Carissa Etienne.

In a statement, the director assured that PAHO is ready to support the nations of the region 'because early detection of cases can prevent the spread of the disease.



Etienne also called for health workers to be well informed about the coronavirus and to strengthen infection prevention and control measures in health facilities to prevent them from contracting acute respiratory diseases.



The PAHO director reported that since the alarm was raised, she has shared information with the health ministries through the channels of the International Health Regulations, and their representatives in the countries.



She also assured that she will continue to update information on what countries can do to respond effectively to this new virus about which there is still much uncertainty.



In December 2019 this new strain of coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, China, and cases are already being reported among Chinese citizens who arrived in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Canada, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal, Malaysia, Germany, Srilanka, France, Australia and Singapore.
