Senior high school students will now be allowed to fly to Australia from China, after the federal government relaxed a travel ban aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus.

The government has announced that years 11 and 12 students, excluding those in Hubei province, can travel to Australia to resume their studies.

The decision affects about 760 students, including 389 who are studying VCE in Victoria. The students entry will still be decided on a case-by-case basis.

The government is yet to allow university students back in, a decision that will be reviewed next week.
