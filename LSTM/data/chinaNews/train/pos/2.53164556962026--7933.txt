The Malaysian Association of Tour and Travel Agents (MATTA) has inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with three national travel associations from India to boost traveller traffic between Malaysia and India, in conjunction with Visit Malaysia 2020.

The associations are Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI), Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI) and Outbound Tour Operators Association of India (OTOAI).

MATTA’s president Tan Kok Liang said in a statement that MATTA will be “introducing fresh itineraries and attractive tour packages to encourage more tourists from India to visit Malaysia”.

Work with airlines to expand routes and flight frequencies will continue so as to build India into a “stronger tourist source market”.

Last year, the Malaysian government extended the Electronic Travel Registration and Information (eNTRI) system, exempting tourists from India and China from applying for a visa for visits of up to 15 days.

Indian arrivals to Malaysia have grown from 552,739 in 2017 to 750,000 in 2019.
