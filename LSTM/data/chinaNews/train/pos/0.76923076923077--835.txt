Three-hour show, two-show days. Are you going to miss those?

(Laughs) I think it’s Ethel Merman who said that when you lead a show like this, you basically have the life of a monk. I have loved this from start to finish. However. It was a couple of months ago that they announced the end date, and you start to think: “Oh, I can go to the movies. I can go out to dinner.” I am looking forward to that. And there is life in the old gal yet. There’s plans for a China tour, an Australian tour and a national tour. If it happens, I would be so foolish to turn my back on the opportunity.

As a fitness regimen, how is this show?

Right before I met with them to do this, some neighbors challenged us to a local “Biggest Loser” competition. I lost 50 pounds before the first day of rehearsal. I said to myself, “Just my luck. They’re going to say to me, ‘Hey, you’ve got to put on some weight. You’re playing Tevye.’” But more than once in the script, he says he’s starving. If he’s not dipping into his own cheese, he’s going to be a little less fat than thin. Since I’ve been doing this show, I haven’t darkened the door of a gym. I’m actually anticipating the freshman 10. The show is a beautiful workout.

Will you keep the beard?

I don’t know. I like it. I mean, first performance of “Fiddler” downtown, I probably looked like Moses. It was way too long. And then I was like, “I don’t want to scare people on the street.” No one said I could, but I was like, “I’m trimming it back, because I want to look good.”

Is talking about this making you sad?

Not yet. I really thought I was going to be more of a basket case tonight.
