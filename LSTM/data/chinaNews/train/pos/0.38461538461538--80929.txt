The government is inching towards a relaxation of the coronavirus travel ban for stranded Chinese students, with the country's top medical officials advising they could soon be permitted to return to Australia subject to public health guarantees.

With universities facing major financial losses as 100,000 foreign students remain stuck offshore while the semester begins, the government is developing options to contain the fallout for the sector.

The travel ban has been extended for another week but federal and state chief health and medical officers have advised "there is a case for government to consider ... a temporary relaxation of the travel restrictions to allow entry to a larger number of tertiary students" after February 29 if coronavirus cases in China do not blow out.

The officers cautioned that any easing of restrictions should be subject to cases levelling off in provinces outside Hubei, where the outbreak began. The advice stated there would still be a low risk of importing cases to Australia if the current characteristics of the virus were maintained.
