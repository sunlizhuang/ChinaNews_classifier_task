“(Brown’s) portrayal of the role and importance of the lower Snake River dams in the survival of the southern resident orcas is at odds with information available from NOAA Fisheries, the federal agency responsible for the recovery of both orcas and Chinook salmon,” Meira said.

Supporters of retaining the lower Snake River dams warn that if they are removed, the hydropower dams on the Columbia between Washington and Oregon will be the next target.

Brown said that Oregon and Washington can work together to improve an agreement on spill over Columbia hydrosystem dams to help endangered fish.

In addition, Oregon has the capacity to increase interim hatchery production of salmon for orcas without displacing existing wild salmon populations.

Oregon already has fish that will be available to orcas as soon as 2021, Brown said.

“I would like to partner with you to help ensure this initiative is fully funded and sustainable during the necessary interim period while long-term solutions are addressed,” she told Inslee.

Northwest RiverPartners said that it supports Brown’s near-term, practical suggestion for increased fish hatchery production, but cannot support her advocacy for tearing out dams as a long-term solution.
