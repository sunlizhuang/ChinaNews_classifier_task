SHENZHEN, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- SF Airlines, China's largest cargo airline, will see its fleet of all-cargo freighters exceed 60 in 2020, according to the airline Monday.

Besides the expanding fleet, SF Airlines will also see a continuously expanding global air route network with more than 70 destinations worldwide in 2020, said the cargo airline.

"China's air cargo market is embracing greater opportunities and challenges alongside the advance of the Belt and Road Initiative and higher demands in the global logistics system from all sectors," said Liddel Li, president of SF Airlines.

The Shenzhen-based cargo airline is the aviation branch of China's express giant SF Express. It provides specialized services for the booming express delivery business and other air freight services such as chartered freight flights.
