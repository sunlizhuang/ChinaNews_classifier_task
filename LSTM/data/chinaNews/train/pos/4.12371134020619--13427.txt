China has sought to improve its bilateral relations with Sri Lanka to form comprehensive strategic partnership, Daily Mirror learns.

This was discussed when Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called on President Gotabaya on January 14. The two countries already enjoy strategic partnership cooperation.

In diplomatic terms, comprehensive strategic partnership makes bilateral cooperation all dimensional, multi-layered and wide ranging. It will cover not only security and political matters but also other aspects such as cooperation on culture.

The two countries have already established ‘strategic partnership’ which means all-weather friendship. China has formed comprehensive strategic partnership with many countries in the world including the European Union.

The Chinese Minister’s visit was aimed at laying the ground work for President Rajapaksa’s visit to Beijing next week. The dates have not yet been fixed for the meeting. (Kelum Bandara)
