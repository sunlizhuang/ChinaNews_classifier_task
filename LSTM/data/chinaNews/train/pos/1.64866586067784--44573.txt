KUCHING: All Chinese nationals and foreigners who have been to China in the last 14 days will be refused entry into Sarawak with immediate effect.



The Sarawak State Disaster Management Committee said, however, that the measure would exclude those with employment passes, student passes or long-term social visit passes.



“They must undergo compulsory self-quarantine at home for 14 days,” it said in a statement yesterday.



Sarawakians returning from China in the last 14 days must also undertake the same self-quarantine measure. — Bernama
