Major Australian businesses have ordered staff who have recently visited China to stay at home for 14 days to avoid any potential spread of the deadly coronavirus to colleagues.

Several large consulting firms with offices across the country have implemented tough new rules to reduce the chances of staff being exposed to the virus, which originated in Wuhan in the Hubei province. Companies are also limiting travel to China until the outbreak subsides.

Major consulting firm UBS has requested staff who have recently visited China not to return to their Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane and Sydney workplaces for two weeks, and has temporarily shut the Hong Kong office.

"The Hong Kong office will open as normal on Wednesday," a spokeswoman said. All of UBS' offices in mainland China are shut until February 3 in line with the extended national holiday.
