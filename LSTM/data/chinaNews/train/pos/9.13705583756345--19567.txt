PETALING JAYA: In a show of unity as the Lunar New Year approaches, schoolkids from an Islamic nursery in Shah Alam paid their Chinese neighbours a visit with festive greetings and cookies.

According to a video by news portal Free Malaysia Today (FMT), the 69 children who hail from Pusat Asuhan Tunas Islam (Pasti) Little Imtiyaz, split into groups to visit as many Chinese families as possible in their neighbourhood.

Pasti manager Farriz Abd Rahman said it is an annual affair for the young children to visit their Chinese neighbours, part of ongoing efforts to educate them about the importance of diversity in a multi-racial setting.

“We will distribute gifts and cookies and at the same time, educate the children about good values, respect, the importance of charity, good neighbourliness and friendship.

“So, the children grow up to be people of piety. May our efforts be blessed, ” he told FMT in the video.

The children were seen clad in green uniforms as they excitedly greeted Chinese neighbours they met.

The short video also showed a Chinese couple handing out angpow packets to the children who greeted them.
