Neil Barrett debuted an upcoming collaboration with Chinese sportswear brand Li-Ning as part of his Fall/Winter 2020 runway show in Milan. The joint foray consists of two co-designed technical running sneakers, which Barrett describes as “an essential component” of a new uniform.

While little has been given by way of specifics, we know that the Neil Barrett x Li-Ning Lion Dance is showcased in black and brown colorways, and the Essence 2.3 is pictured in white on the runway and black, worn by the designer himself backstage and during his appearance at the end of the show.

The collaborative sneakers from Neil Barrett and Li-Ning are scheduled to release at Neil Barrett stores and Li-Ning retail locations later in 2020. Expect additional details to surface as the launch date nears.

News of the impending collab arrives as Li-Ning’s light-up Aurora 2020 with Random Identities is slated to drop in just a matter of days.
