China’s Vice Agriculture Minister Han Jun told Caixin media that the country is not going to adjust overall annual quota for the three staple food despite the US-China trade deal phase one. The annual quotas are 9.64 million tonnes for wheat, 7.2 million tonnes for corn and 5.32 million tonnes for rice.

“This is a global quota. We will not adjust for one country,” Han said. “China imports wheat, corn and rice from the international market, mainly to moderate the domestic surplus”. Han’s comments were in line with some expectations that China has to cut imports from other markets to accommodate the agreed increase in US agricultural products.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He has scheduled to travel to Washington from January 13 to 15, to sign the phase one trade deal with the US.
