AKP Phnom Penh, February 24, 2020 --

Cambodia and China will finalise their free trade agreement (FTA) later this year, as line officials of the two countries are accelerating their negotiations.

The FTA between Cambodia and China will be signed in November this year, said Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo Hun Sen, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, adding that the signing will take place during a visit of Chinese Premier H.E. Li Keqiang to Cambodia, when the Kingdom hosts the ASEM Summit.

“I hope that China will import more products from Cambodia when FTA comes into force,” the Premier said this morning in a special statement to his compatriots on the recent developments in the country.

The first round of negotiations on FTA was held in Beijing, China in January and the second round is scheduled for coming April in Cambodia.
