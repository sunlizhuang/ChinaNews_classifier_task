The world's oldest captive giant panda Xinxing and her four "great-grandchildren" celebrated the upcoming Spring Festival at a zoo in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality Tuesday. The 37-year-old celebrity "granny panda," her age equivalent to more than 100 human years, was treated with carrots, apples, bamboo shoots and leaves in the panda house decorated with lanterns and streamers. The food was carried to the dining area by the four panda cubs in baskets on their back as gifts for their "great-grandmother" to mark the occasion of their first meeting.
