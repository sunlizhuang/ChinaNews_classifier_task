Melvin Poindexter will speak at Canton Town Democratic Committee at 7:30 p.m. Jan. 9 at the Waterfall Bar and Grille in Canton Center, 643 Washington St., Canton.

Poindexter will share his thoughts and experiences with regards to the processes and events culminating in the selection of a presidential candidate and development of the party platform.

“Every four years, Democrats convene a national convention to choose our nominee for president,” Poindexter said. “In order to select a nominee, a body of Democrats, called delegates, from every state come together and cast their vote on a Democratic presidential candidate. The candidate with the majority votes wins the nomination. The convention is also an opportunity for the party to discuss and adopt its principles and goals, which is called a platform.”

In 2017, Poindexter was elected to the Democratic National Committee. Before that, he has participated and held positions in several activist groups.

A social event and buffet dinner at 6:30 p.m. will precede Poindexter’s talk. Poindexter’s talk is free, but there is a charge of $19 charge, $7 for students, to attend the dinner.
