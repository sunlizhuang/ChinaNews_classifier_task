Miguel Arias Cañete, EU climate action and energy commissioner, is set to sign sustainable energy declarations with Pacific Island countries this week — an effort to strengthen ties ahead of the Paris global climate summit.

Arias Cañete, who is attending the Pacific Island Forum Leaders meeting in Papua New Guinea starting today, will sign the declarations to help six small countries — the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Republic of the Marshall Islands and Tonga — meet their national energy goals.

“This year's forum will be an important opportunity to unite together with the view to secure a strong and credible global climate deal that will significantly accelerate the global transition to a climate resilient sustainable future," Arias Cañete said.

The countries are among the most vulnerable to climate change risks, and have long emphasized this year’s agreement must focus on ways to strengthen their resilience and mobilize the necessary funds.

Their concern is reflected in the Commission’s position on what a successful climate agreement should entail, stating today that Paris “must also address adaptation … and the mobilization of financing for climate action, as well as reflect the issue of loss and damage associated with the impacts of climate change.”

Arias Cañete will be meeting with the prime minister of Papua New Guinea, Peter O'Neill, as well as leaders from the Marshall Islands, New Zealand, Australia, China, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Nauru, Fiji and Vanuatu.
