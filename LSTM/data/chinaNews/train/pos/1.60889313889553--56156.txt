The Ministry of Health is strongly encouraging people in self-isolation, as a result of their travel to China, to register through Healthline.

From tomorrow, Healthline will be set up to register people and regularly check on their welfare and wellbeing while in self-isolation.

The Ministry’s current advice is that people should self-isolate for a period of 14 days if they’ve arrived in New Zealand, either from or via China since February 2. People who’ve specifically travelled to Wuhan or Hubei province prior to February 2 should also self-isolate.

‘By registering through Healthine, staff will be able to check on people’s wellbeing and welfare regularly. Registering will also support our broader response to novel coronavirus,’ says the Ministry’s Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield.

‘We are constantly updating our health advice on the website, including for people in self-isolation. Registering via Healthline ensures we can continue to provide the most up to date and comprehensive advice and support.
