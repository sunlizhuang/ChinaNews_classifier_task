But family man Jeff Goldblum proved that there is no schedule too busy for his wife Emilie and their two sons Charlie, four, and River, two, as they walked hand-in-hand in Beverly Hills on Sunday.

The star and his familial gang were joined by his sister Pamela for some Chinese cuisine at acclaimed restaurant Xi'an.

Jeff wed his beloved Emilie back in 2014, having previously been married to Thelma and Louise star Geena Davis in 1987 and actress Patricia Gaul in 1980.

The Jurassic Park alum recently enjoyed a more extravagant evening out with his dancer wife during Oscar weekend when they hit up the highly coveted award show's Vanity Fair after party.

After the star-studded party, Goldblum took to his Instagram page to remark on the 'enjoyable' time he had with Emilie.

In conjunction with his thoughtful words, the actor shared a slew of snapshots of the couple from their bout during the evening's famous step-and-repeat.

Last year, it was announced that Jeff would reprise his role as Dr. Ian Malcolm, once more, for the the third Jurassic World installment.

It will be an all-star reunion as original trilogy castmates Laura Dern and Sam Neill join Goldblum in the upcoming feature that will continue to star newbies Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard.
