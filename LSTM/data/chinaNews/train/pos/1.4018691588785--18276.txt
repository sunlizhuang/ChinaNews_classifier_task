BEIJING, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- China's national legislature and political advisory body invite journalists at home and abroad to report their annual sessions to be held in March, an official statement said Wednesday.

The 13th National People's Congress (NPC), China's national legislature, will start its third annual session on March 5, and the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the country's national political advisory body, will begin its third annual session on March 3.

A press center for the two sessions will open on Feb. 27, said the statement jointly issued by the general offices of the NPC Standing Committee and the CPPCC National Committee.

Chinese reporters and foreign journalists in China should submit applications for passes to the press center, while foreign reporters temporarily in China for the two sessions should apply to Chinese embassies or visa organizations authorized by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Reporters from Hong Kong and Macao should apply at the central government's liaison offices in the two special administrative regions, and reporters from Taiwan should apply to the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council.

The deadline for applications is Feb. 15, and more information is available on the NPC and CPPCC websites.
