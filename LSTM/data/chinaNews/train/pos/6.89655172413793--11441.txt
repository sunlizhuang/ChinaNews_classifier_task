Tennessee Farm Bureau President Jeff Aiken commented on the Phase 1 trade deal signed Wednesday between the United States and China.

The Farm Bureau is headquartered in Columbia.

“The ‘Phase 1’ trade agreement signed by President Trump with China showed an important step to renew and expand export markets vital to our farmers in Tennessee and across the country. Exports of agricultural products to China are expected to reach at least $40 billion annually for the next two years, which opens historic trading opportunities for our farmers.

“We’ve said all along we want trade, not aid. The Administration has succeeded in securing agreements benefiting not only our farmers, but all Americans, and we remain hopeful for additional trade agreements with other countries who are hungry for American products.”
