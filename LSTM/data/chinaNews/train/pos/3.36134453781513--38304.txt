BERLIN, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- German politicians and entrepreneurs have established a networking platform China-Bridge (CHINA-BRUECKE) to enhance ties between the two countries.

The non-profit organization will serve as a long-term channel between Germany and China, Hans-Peter Friedrich, chairman of the China-Bridge and the vice president of the German Bundestag, told Xinhua in a recent interview.

Friedrich said Germany needs stability on the Eurasian continent and China is a key partner in order to reach this goal.

"For the rest of the century China will be one of the major partners of German politics for economic and geopolitical reasons and among others. We would like to support the two countries' relations by offering a civil society voice," Friedrich said.

Friedrich said Germany needs more know-hows about China in the political sphere, as well as in civil society.

"For now in Germany, many people lack a basic idea of China. Except for our experts in foreign policy. The knowledge about China has enough room for improvement in most parts of society," Friedrich said.

By interconnecting business and politics by working complementary to existing organizations and other institutions, China-Bridge can foster tighter ties, Friedrich said.

"We support each other's activities. We hope that many likeminded politicians of all parties will join us to work towards stronger cooperation on all levels." Friedrich said.
