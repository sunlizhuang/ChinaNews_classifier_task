(ECNS) -- China's National Cultural Heritage Administration has called for scenic spots and organizations to open their historic buildings to the public as much as possible.

In a new guideline, the administration encourages scenic spots to display relics using new techniques and take measures to encourage public participation and interactions.

In order to improve tourist experiences, they can divide tourist times into day tours and night tours according to their own circumstances, the guideline says.
