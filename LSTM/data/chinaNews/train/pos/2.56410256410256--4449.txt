GULF airline Emirates carried 448,000 passengers between Dublin and Dubai last year, with the figure largely unchanged on 2018, the carrier said yesterday.

The number of passengers visiting Dubai from Ireland was up 11pc, it said. That represented passengers out of Dublin who did not book a connecting flight from Dubai with Emirates.

Emirates launched its route between Dublin and Dubai eight years ago.

The airline said that it carried 15,700 of cargo on the route last year, with goods also destined for onward travel to destinations including Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai. Emirates pointed out that those are strong markets for food exports from Ireland including oysters, crab and salmon.

Pharmaceuticals accounted for more than 2,500 tonnes of cargo carried on the route in 2019, with destinations in Australia, India and the Middle East.

The country manager for Emirates in Ireland, Enda Corneille, said the airline was "really pleased" that passenger numbers on the route were maintained during 2019 despite the "threat of restrained consumer spending, which was a concern across many sectors".

He added that while many of its passengers out of Ireland are travelling to onward destinations, a "significant number" are remaining in Dubai for business and leisure.

Emirates said the most popular destinations for passengers out of Ireland are Dubai, Bangkok and Sydney.

The carrier also managed to hold passenger numbers steady despite competition from Etihad on the Dublin-Abu Dhabi route, and new services such as Cathay Pacific's Dublin-Hong Kong route.

Cathay Pacific last year cancelled that service until the end of next March.
