The first report on the development of the Chinese borderland, including the Xinjiang Uygur and Tibet autonomous regions, was released by the Institute of Chinese Borderland Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing on Tuesday.

The report, Blue Book of the Borderland, analyzed and evaluated the economic and social development in nine provinces and autonomous regions in the border areas of China in 2018, including Heilongjiang province, Jilin province, Inner Mongolia autonomous region and Tibet autonomous region.

"It is the first time we have published such a report on Chinese borderland, and it will be an annual report in the coming years," Xing Guangcheng, head of the Institute, said at a press conference on Tuesday.

Along with the regional reports, the book analyzed the strategic cooperation between China's border areas and its surrounding areas and reviewed the border strategy after the founding of the People's Republic of China. The last part of the book examines recent progress in the construction of the six international cooperation corridors.

"The development of China's frontier areas is an important part of China's development and a major problem the Chinese government has been focused on solving, and with the gradual promotion and deepening of the Belt and Road Initiative, the role played by China's frontier needs to be carefully studied," Xing said.

"Now with detailed information and reliable data, we have published the Blue Book to provide an authoritative and professional research report on the development of China's frontier areas," Xing added.
