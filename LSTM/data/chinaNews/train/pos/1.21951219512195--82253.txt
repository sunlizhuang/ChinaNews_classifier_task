The Snohomish County man who was the country’s fist documented case of coronavirus is said to have fully recovered, the Snohomish Health District announced Friday.

The man affected was reportedly traveling through Sea-Tac Airport after a trip to China near the Wuhan region. He was initially hospitalized with symptoms the week before a coronavirus diagnosis was confirmed. He spent a couple weeks in an isolation unit at the Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, and then was quarantined for a few weeks at home.
