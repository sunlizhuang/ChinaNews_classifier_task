Shanghai (Gasgoo)- Prior to the scale delivery of the China-built Tesla Model 3, the EV manufacturer has offered the first round of price reduction to consumers in China.



Guide price of a homegrown Model 3 Standard Range-Plus will be reduced by RMB32,000 to RMB323,800, according to a post on Tesla's WeChat account. It means that a buyer would get a Tesla Model 3 car with only RMB299,050 since the long-waited model also enjoys China's governmental NEV subsidy of RMB24,750.

Besides, users that have made pre-order also can benefit from the price reduction, a sales man briefed on the matter exposed.

Despite the price cut, Model 3's car buyers are allowed to select the type of charging piles and installment service. The home charging services for owners of Model S/X remain unchanged.

On December 30, the first batch of China-built Tesla Model 3 cars were handed over to 15 Tesla employees at the startup's first manufacturing plant outside the U.S.â€”Shanghai-based Gigafactory 3. The EV manufacturer said it will officially kick off the scale delivery on January 7.



Additionally, the Model 3 BEVs locally produced by Tesla's Shanghai plant have been exempted from the vehicle purchase tax on NEVs, according to a filing released by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) on December 27.
