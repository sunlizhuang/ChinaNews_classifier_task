If there’s one thing my time at UC Berkeley has taught me, it’s that having three meals each day is preferred but doesn’t always happen. Between everything we’re expected to do and whatever we’re actually doing, food can take a backseat in our list of priorities. This is even more true if you want to save some cash and cook your own meals. A quick, simple meal that is cheap to make would be the answer to all of our problems — and that meal takes the form of fried rice. This quick, Chinese-inspired take on the dish requires only a few easy-to-find ingredients and will last you several meals.

Ingredients

2 cups basmati rice

2 tablespoons oil

½ onion, finely chopped

1 cup frozen mixed vegetables of your choice

3 tablespoons soy sauce

1 egg

Directions

Prepare the rice with your preferred cooking method, leaving it slightly underdone. Heat the oil in a nonstick pan, then add the onions and sauté them until they’re translucent. Microwave the frozen vegetables per the package instructions and then add them to the pan. Add the rice and soy sauce, stirring until the rice is fully cooked. Crack the egg into the pan and mix until the egg is well-cooked and evenly scrambled. Serve and enjoy!

Start the semester off well with this quick and nutritious recipe. Happy eating!
