MUNICH, Germany, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday called for crossing East-West difference and practicing multilateralism in a speech here at the 56th Munich Security Conference (MSC)

In his speech, Wang elaborated the attendees on the current situation of China's fight against the outbreak of the novel coronavirus under the leadership of the Chinese President Xi Jinping.

He said that the strict measures taken by the Chinese government are now taking effect, and China is fully confident in and capable of winning the war against the epidemic.

"I believe that after the epidemic, the Chinese economy will stride forward on a healthier and more sustainable track. The Chinese people will become more resolute to build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, eradicate the absolute poverty and achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," said the Chinese foreign minister.

He added that the epidemic had made mankind realize that it is now an era with traditional and non-traditional security threats being interweaved. A regional issue can be transformed into a global one, and vice versa. Therefore, no country can stay alone and be immune to the threats. Instead, all countries are inter-connected and share a common destiny.

"Strengthening global governance and international coordination is urgent right now. We need to get rid of the division of the East and the West and go beyond the difference between the South and the North, in a bid to build a community with a shared future for mankind," added Wang.
