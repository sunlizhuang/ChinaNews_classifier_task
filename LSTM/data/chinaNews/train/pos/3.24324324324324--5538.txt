A group of Chinese investors met Cambodian minister Agriculture Veng Sakhon in Phnom Penh to discuss and explore the opportunity in coconut farming

As reported in the Khmer Times, the director of Hainan State Farms Investment Holding Group Wang Yeqiao discussed the possibilities to export Cambodian coconut to China, as neighbouring Thailand is already exporting the product to China.

Wang explained that the Cambodian Coconuts, like rice, mango, banana and cassava, can be exported to China as they have great potential.

Welcoming the companyâ€™s intention to invest in Cambodian coconut sector, Sakhon said that the government is working to expand the types of products exported to the Chinese market.

According to a study, the coconut sector in Cambodia remains largely underdeveloped and untapped. However, the sector has huge possibilities to generate large-scale profits, added the source.
