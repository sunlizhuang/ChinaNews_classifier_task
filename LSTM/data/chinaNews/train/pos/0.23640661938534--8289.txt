Last year, Trump withdrew a preferential trade status for certain Indian goods in a sign of U.S. displeasure, and India retaliated with tariff hikes of its own. Since then, the two countries have engaged in talks to bridge their trade differences but have yet to resolve them.

After Trump appeared with Modi before cheering crowds at a stadium in Houston, Trump likened the Indian leader to rock star Elvis Presley.
