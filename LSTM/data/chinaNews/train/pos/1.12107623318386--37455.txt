The Government of China has expedited steps for Sri Lanka to land a special flight in Wuhan Province in China, stated the Foreign Secretary.

This is to evacuate the Sri Lankan students and families currently residing in the province.

Meanwhile, the Chinese Embassy has advised Chinese companies employees from Hubei province to halt their plans back to Sri Lanka and those from other provinces and cities to quarantine themselves for at least 14 days after arriving in Sri Lanka.

The Department of Government Information, informing the clarifications provided by the Chinese Embassy on the outbreak of the Coronavirus, stated that Chinese authorities have established an all-dimensional and multi-level epidemic containing network where CPC Central leads governments at all levels and has been putting great efforts in Wuhan and other much infected Hubei cities.

Chinese authorities state they have confidence and the capacity to contain the epidemic and win the fight against it.
