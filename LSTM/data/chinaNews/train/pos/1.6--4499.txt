Elsewhere, WangShui’s video From Its Mouth Came a River of High-End Residential Appliances (2017–18) relates to feng shui—the ancient Chinese practice of achieving harmonious balance between built structures and their surroundings—as a symbol of ideological resistance (feng-shui practitioners in China were persecuted during the Cultural Revolution). The cool-toned drone’s-eye-view recording through Hong Kong’s “dragon gates” (feng shui-inspired, architecturally useless holes in luxury high-rises) is coupled with the artist’s voiceover linking feng shui’s emphasis on emptiness and absence with limitations of the body, of gender, and of ethnicity, creating a mesmerizing sensation of being pulled into the voids. The narrator laments a disassociation with the term “male,” outlining their true desires: “What I do want to know . . . is how to push beyond flawed accountabilities, beyond suspiciously stable identities.” Refusing definition amid current mainstream LGBTQ+ pride, WangShui proposes boundless forms instead of fixed monikers.

In keeping with the film’s call to configure bodies beyond gender, Pixy Liao’s Experimental Relationship (2007– ), a series of photographic self-portraits with her male partner, Moro, casually reverses the cliché of woman as muse. Liao instead invites Moro to wear her clothes, pose nude for her, and, in one photo, act as a human table from which Liao eats a papaya. Shot in warm daylight in domestic spaces, her images deftly pair a declaration of her agency with the lightness and ease of two lovers sharing an inside joke.
