Vinamilk has become the second Vietnamese dairy company eligible to export milk products to China after TH Milk Joint Stock Company.

TH Milk exported its first batch of pure sterilized fresh milk and sterilized fresh milk added with natural flavours to China in October 2019.

The China’s General Administration of Customs said that it will continue to review and evaluate records of other Vietnamese dairy companies.

This is good news for the Vietnam’s dairy industry in early 2020, reflecting the efforts of management agencies in accompanying enterprises over the past years.

However, experts have said that sweetened condensed milk and other condensed milk are not the main products of Vinamilk, the largest milk producer in Vietnam. Thus, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development still has much work to do to help the Vietnamese dairy company to export more products to the Chinese market to take advantage of the preferential import tax rates that Vietnam negotiated with China over 10 years ago.
