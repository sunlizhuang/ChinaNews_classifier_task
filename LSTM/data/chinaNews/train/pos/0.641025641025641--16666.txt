AN expected happy holiday on Boracay island turned into a nightmare for Chinese tourists when the motorbanca they were riding capsized on Tuesday, killing a 45-year-old Chinese woman, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) reported.

The PCG identified the fatality as Hongfang Kuai, who died after a rescue team failed to revive her.

Twenty-three other Chinese, accompanied by two Filipino tourist guides, and three crew were safe.





A report reaching PCG headquarters in Manila said motorbanca Jocelyn 1 overturned then capsized around 11 a.m. off Barangay Balabag.

Rough seas and strong winds caused the motorbanca to overturn.

“Three female passengers who passed out and needed immediate medical assistance were brought to the nearest hospital. They have regained consciousness and are declared safe and in good condition,” the report said.

Those rescued, including the crew, were also declared safe and in good physical condition, the PCG said.
