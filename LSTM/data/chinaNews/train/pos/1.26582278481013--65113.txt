China’s Tianhong Asset Management has appointed HSBC Securities Services as global custodian for its newly launched qualified domestic institutional investor (QDII) mutual fund, the first in the Mainland focusing on Vietnamese securities.

QDII refers to a scheme that allows retail investors in China to invest in foreign markets through qualified financial institutions, including banks, insurers and asset managers, which are each given a quota.

Tianhong, which is controlled by e-commerce giant Alibaba’s subsidiary Ant Financial Services Group, launched the fund last month with an initial fundraising of 200 million RMB (US$28.5 million).

The fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in stocks benchmarked against Vietnam’s VN30 Index and depositary receipts issued by Vietnamese companies, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation says in a statement on February 7.

The bank, the first foreign lender to be granted a custodian licence in the Southeast Asian country, had $2.7 trillion of total assets globally as of September 2019.

Patrick Wong, head of China business development and client management at HSBC Securities Services, describes Vietnam as a “booming market with great investment potential”.

He says in the statement that the Tianhong fund has paved the way for Chinese investors to access Vietnam’s equity funds “and we are very delighted to be part of this development”.

Tianjin-based Tianhong Asset Management had 1.2 trillion RMB of assets under management as of September 2019.
