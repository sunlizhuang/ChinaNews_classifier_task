Pupils experienced the art of Chinese dancing as part of new year celebrations, writes Tomiris Mansurova.

A red and gold dragon was the at the heart of the event where pupils at the All Saints Anglican Methodist Primary School, Elston, were given traditional fans to accompany their dance.

Dan Du, from the Nottingham-based Dans Chinese Dance and Performing Arts Academy, visited the children to take them through the steps and share a taste of Chinese culture.

Year one and two students had the chance to get involved in the workshop for just one day in honour of the Chinese New Year.

The movements of the dance involved flicking colourful fans from left to right, changing rhythms and body positions.

Dan Du said a part of the dance was for children to sing a traditional Chinese New Year song called gong xi, which translates to congratulations.

Rachel Smith-Adams, year one and two teacher, said all the children enjoyed the day and learned a type of dance they had never experienced before.

“It opened their eyes to a different culture that they are unfamiliar with and gave them a deeper understanding about the Chinese New Year celebration,” she said.
