(Bloomberg) --

A money manager founded by one of China’s most famous traders closed orders for a new fund three days earlier than planned, with investors clamoring to get into the offering.

Shanghai-based Foresight Fund attracted about 20 times more interest from investors for its second equity mutual fund than it’s permitted to handle, people familiar with the matter said. The firm, founded by veteran investor Chen Guangming in late 2018, received at least 120 billion yuan ($17 billion) of orders for the fund on Tuesday alone, versus a target of 6 billion yuan, the people said.

The interest meant Foresight Fund closed orders on the first day of subscription, according to a statement Wednesday. The amount of orders makes it China’s most popular mutual-fund launch on record, according to Z-Ben Advisors analyst Liu Shichen.

Only about 5% of orders would have been successful because the firm allocates the fund units proportionally, according to Bloomberg calculations. The allocation ratio would have been around 4.9%, some of the people said. Last year, the firm’s first fund attracted more than 70 billion yuan of orders within just 10 hours. It returned 37% since inception in March through Feb. 18.

The robust orders came amid a fundraising blitz on the mainland. At least 13 new fund products have had to close their subscriptions earlier than scheduled just this month, China Fund News reported Monday.
