Shenzhen-based smartphone manufacturer OnePlus has sent out invites to a press event scheduled to take place in a few days time, a Weibo user reports. It is believed that the Chinese company will unveil exciting new screen technology at the event. Allegedly, smartphones featuring screens with 120 Hz refresh rate might make an appearance.

The information provided on the invitation itself is very minimal, stating only that the recipient is invited to join OnePlus at a 2020 screen technology press event (translated from Chinese) on January 13, 2020, at 2:00 PM local time in Shenzhen, China. So far, no other information has been officially disclosed regarding the upcoming press event.

OnePlus has kicked off this year with a bang, unveiling its Concept One phone at CES 2020 which features an innovative new 'disappearing camera' that uses electrochromic glass technology to become invisible when not in use. Unfortunately, since the OnePlus Concept One is a concept phone, it will not be available for purchase any time soon. Therefore we are unlikely to see a similar model sporting an invisible camera launch at the Shenzhen event next week.

However, considering the leap that the company has made in the field of mobile phone displays with its innovative color-shifting glass, it is probable that OnePlus might unveil interesting new technology on January 13. Hopefully, further information about the event will be revealed in the days to come.
