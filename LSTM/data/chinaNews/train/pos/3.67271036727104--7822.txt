Tullio Crali, Tricolour Wings, 1932 (Ali tricolori). Oil on plywood, 72 x 56 cm.



LONDON .- For Tullio Crali (1910-2000) Futurism was not just a school of painting, but an attitude to life itself. Reflecting the movements enthusiasm for the modern world, his powerful imagery embraced technology and the machine as key sources of creative inspiration. Cralis work focused on the immense visual and sensory drama of flight, and is most closely associated with the genre of aeropainting, which dominated Futurist research during the inter-war years. A new exhibition of works by this towering figure of Italian modernism explores his entire career, and features over 60 rarely seen pieces from the artists family collection, dating from the 1920s to the 1980s.

LONDON .- David Zwirner is presenting an exhibition of work by American artist Ruth Asawa at the gallerys London location. This is the first major presentation of her work outside the United States and includes a number of key forms spanning more than five decades of the artists career, focusing in particular on the relationship between Asawas wire sculptures and her wide-ranging body of works on paper. An influential artist, devoted activist, and tireless advocate for arts education, Asawa is best known for her extensive body of hanging wire sculptures.
