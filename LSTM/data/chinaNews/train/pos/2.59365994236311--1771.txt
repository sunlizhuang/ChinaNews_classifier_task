China Classification Society (CCS) has approved technology firm Wartsila’s Exhaust Gas Cleaning (EGC) system.

Dalian Shipbuilding Industry has placed the order for installation of the system onboard the New Treasure vessel, which is a new very large crude carrier (VLCC).

The vessel is being constructed for Associated Maritime of Hong Kong, a part of the China Merchants Energy Shipping group. It is the largest VLCC owner in China and a leading crude oil tanker operator.

Wartsila said that CCS approval represents a ‘breakthrough’ for its system in the Chinese market.

Full-scale testing was conducted following its installation onboard the ship. Then, as an independent third party, Dalian Maritime University analysed and reported the relevant data.



The analysis involved a design review and the scrubber tower fabrication to check if it is in accordance with the CCS class and quality requirements.

Wartsila Marine director for exhaust treatment Jan Othman said: “This is a success story that clearly endorses the efficiency and quality of our EGC systems. Having CCS Type Approval now means that this product can be installed on any CCS class ship without the need for further emissions testing.”
