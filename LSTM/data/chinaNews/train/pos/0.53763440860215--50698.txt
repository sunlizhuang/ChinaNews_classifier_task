Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, February 4) — President Rodrigo Duterte has approved allocating ₱2.25 billion to protect health workers who will care for patients infected with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Tuesday.

During the Senate inquiry on the government's preparations in addressing the outbreak, he said the budget will be for the procurement of protective equipment for health workers. This will include a set of protective equipment: head gear, goggles, n95 masks, gloves, aprons, and gowns, which costs ₱1,500 per set. He said they will purchase this for 5,000 healthcare workers, adding there will be three shifts per day.

Duque said Duterte approved the funds "in principle" during their emergency meeting on Monday. He said the budget set is for the assumption that the threat of coronavirus spread will last for three months.

The Health Department is monitoring 80 patients under investigation. The Philippines has two confirmed cases — a couple who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus that has killed over 470 people and infected 20,000 globally.
