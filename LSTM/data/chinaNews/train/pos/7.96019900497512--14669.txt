Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s message to his Afghan counterpart Idrees Zaman on occasion of 65th anniversary of establishment of Sino-Afghan diplomatic relations

“His Excellency Mr. Idrees Zaman

Acting Foreign Minister of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan

Your Excellency,

As the People’s Republic of China and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan mark the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties, I would like to extend my warm congratulations and best wishes to Your Excellency.

China and Afghanistan are traditional friendly neighbors linked by mountains and rivers. Over the past 65 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties, China-Afghanistan bilateral relations have developed healthily and steadily under the joint efforts of both sides. In recent years, China and Afghanistan have joined hands to build the “Belt and Road Initiative”, deepen practical cooperation in various fields, constantly enrich the strategic partnership, and actively devote themselves to peace, security and development between the two countries and the region at large.

I am willing to work with you to follow through the important consensus reached by our leaders, keep moving China-Afghanistan relations forward, and bring more benefits to the two peoples.”

Wang Yi

State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People’s Republic of China
