"Take Care," a project on golden monkeys shot by Chinese photographer Zhang Qiang, has won the Lumix Award of the 2019 Nature's Best Photography Asia Awards in Tokyo, Japan.

Zhang was the only Chinese photographer to bag this prestigious award. As a young promising photographer Zhang hopes to show the beauty of Chinese landscapes and animals to the world through his lens. He wants to convey the importance of nature and raise people's awareness of environmental protection.

Qinling Mountains are the most important geographical dividing line between northern and southern China. Not only is it considered to be the biobank of China but it is also seen as one of the biobanks of the world.

Golden monkeys, a unique animal species found in the Qinling Mountains of Shaanxi Province, generally dwelling in an area with a low altitude of 2,000 meters during winters and early spring time. These creatures reside in a remote habitat, thus making it difficult for photographers to take pictures of them.

Zhang Qiang's award-winning photographs will be exhibited in the "Wonders of Wildlife Museum" for a year. Thereafter, his works will also tour Asia so that people can get a chance to see his excellent photographs.
