Xiaomi recently crowdfunded its first smart calendar. The product is called the ‘Youpin & Seconds Smart Health Calendar’. The Xiaomi smart calendar has the functions of displaying weather information, quotes, local air quality and of course, a calendar. The product is priced at CNY 199 (about Rs 2,000).

The Youpin & Seconds Smart Health Calendar is part of a new generation of smart products. The smart calendar negates the need of having a separate paper calendar every year. Further, the Youpin & Seconds Smart Health Calendar is made of ABS + PC material, and has a ceramic fire design. The eco-friendly material used in the smart calendar makes it a much better option to paper calendars, which have to be disposed each year, Gizmochina reports.
