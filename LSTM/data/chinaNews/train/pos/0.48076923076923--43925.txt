AMMONNEWS - An aircraft carrying 71 Jordanian and Arab students arrived at the Queen Alia International Airport Saturday dawn.



Acting Health Minister Saleh al-Kharabsheh said the Jordanian students will be transferred to al-Bashir Hospital for examination to ensure that they are free from infection. The passengers will not enter the airport building as a precaution, he added.



Transport Minister Khalid Saif pointed out that there were 55 Jordanian students and 15 Arab nationals on board the Royal Jordanian aircraft, which is the first official carrier of a country to enter the Wuhan airport for evacuation.

They will be received by equipped medical cadres in a hospital, where procedures to ensure their safety were taken, he added.



He said the examination will start on Sunday after the arrival of the necessary equipment, noting that the aircraft will be sterilized over the course of five days.
