Chinese smartphone brand Vivo has opened an experiential flagship store in Thane, Maharashtra as Vivo India eyes 250 new stores this year.

The 1800sqft outlet is the second of 20 stores planned for the territory, according to the India News Service. Vivo India currently operates an experiential retail store in Bengaluru as well.

“The offline channel has been an essential part of our go-to-market strategy and we would continue to invest in this channel,” said Vivo India director of brand strategy Nipun Marya.

“We intend to launch more than 250 exclusive stores in 2020, taking the total number to 600.”





Showcasing Vivo’s entire range of devices and accessories, the store will also feature an interactive touch-enabled LED screen allowing customers to explore products in more detail, as well as gaming, VR and customer interaction zones.
