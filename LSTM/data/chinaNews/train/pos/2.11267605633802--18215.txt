AKP Phnom Penh, January 22, 2020 --

The direct flight between Henan and Cambodia will be launched soon, Cambodian Tourism Minister H.E. Thong Khon said after meeting with leaders of Zhengzhou city and Henan province of China on Jan. 20-21.

The inaugural flight is scheduled for the end of 2019 Cambodia-China Culture and Tourism Year, i.e. at the beginning of April, he pointed out.

This new direct route will attract Chinese tourists from Henan to visit Cambodia, particularly the temples of Angkor in the province of Siem Reap, he added.

With the support of the Chinese side, the Ministry of Tourism will request the Royal Government of Cambodia to establish a tourism representative office in this Chinese province in order to strengthen tourism cooperation and promotion as well as to attract more Chinese tourists and investors in Cambodia.
