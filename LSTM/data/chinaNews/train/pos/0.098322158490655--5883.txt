The tall Dane, Viktor Axelsen, and the Spanish star, Carolina Marin, were the only Europeans left in the semifinals at this year’s Malaysia Masters.





The first European to go on court was the reigning Olympic champion Caroline Marin. She was facing the second seeded Chen Yu Fei from China. Last time the two players met, was in the semifinals at the Indonesia Masters in 2019, where Marin came out as winner after a 23-21 win in the third game.





But that was not how it ended today. Marin and Chen were close most of the first game, but at 15-15, Chen made 6 points in a row and took the first game 21-15. In the second game Marin was always 4 to 5 points behind and did not manage to make contact to the strong Chinese. Chen Yu Fei secured her spot in the final by winning 21-14 in the second game.





The last hope

Viktor Axelsen was facing Ng Ka Long Angus from Hong Kong China in today’s semifinal.





Much like Marin’s semifinal, Axelsen and Ng were close during the first part of the first game.

Then after the break, Axelsen did not look back and won 21-14. In the second game the Hong Kong Chinese player got a good start and was leading until 9-5, where Axelsen made 7 points in a row and all of a sudden was in charge of the match again. The rest of the match was close, but in the end the Dane came out on top with 21-18.





Tomorrow Axelsen will be facing Japan’s Kento Momota.
