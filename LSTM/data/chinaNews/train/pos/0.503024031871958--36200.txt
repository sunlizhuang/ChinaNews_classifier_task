1 – ‘Fine fibre’ first: Kao to release first cosmetic products based on skin hydration technology​

Japanese cosmetics maker Kao Corporation will launch the first products based on its new ‘fine-fibre’ technology​ in its domestic market from December 4, with an international roll-out following in early 2020.

Kao Corporation first announced the development of its fine fibre technology in 2018. This technology creates a very thin and invisible layer of film on the skin and acts as a moisture barrier to keep skin hydrated.

Kao claimed that this membrane allows for quick and even application of cosmetic products. Additionally, it is able to retain products and moisture while allowing skin to breathe.

The company worked with technology company Panasonic to develop a handheld diffuser device which consumers can use in the comfort of home. This dispenser uses electrospinning technology to create the film.

The company will first launch fine-fibre technology products under its brands, est and Sensai, as a nighttime skin care treatment.

2 – Scent of a nation: Symrise sees Chinese millennials as the future of fine fragrance

Symrise has sought to decode China’s fragrance identity and connect with the all-important Chinese millennial demographic.​

The firm held its Scent Fiction event alongside Cosmoprof Asia 2019 and explored China’s identity and youth culture through eight specially crafted scents.

The exhibition was a multidisciplinary cross-collaboration between the fragrance supplier, NEZ magazine, artist Alan Chan and design agency Somexing.

Julie Deschamps, creative director of Symrise Asia Pacific told CosmeticsDesign-Asia​ that the company’s aim was to conduct an “olfactive exploration of Asian youth culture”.​

“It's super important to understand the millennials in Asia, and especially in China because we realised that the China market is growing for fine fragrances, but they don't understand a lot about perfume.”​

The firm believes the young Chinese consumer is growing more curious about fine fragrances because of their exposure to Western influences and love of luxury goods.

3 – Black Chicken Remedies aiming to expand into Asian market as ‘clean’ trend grows

The CEO of Aussie beauty and wellness brand Black Chicken Remedies believes the brand has growth potential in Asia’s budding clean beauty space.​

Black Chicken Remedies was born over a decade ago when founder and CEO Chey Birch blended a body oil to treat her own skin condition.

Since then, the brand has expanded to an entire range of beauty, health and wellness products spanning over 50 SKUs. The brand’s best-selling product is its all-natural deodorant, which has won several accolades in Australia.

“When we first brought out the deodorant, everyone said: are you kidding? You want me to touch my armpit? Today, we are under one million armpits and growing,” ​said Birch.

Today, the brand’s oil cleansers, tongue scrapers, and deodorants are available across Australia, the US, Dubai and parts of the pacific.

The company is currently looking to expand into Asia to further drive the growth of the business.

4 – An ‘e-commerce’ firm no longer: Lazada Singapore CEO says the future is in ‘new retail’ space

South East Asian retailer says Lazada says the lines are continuing to blur between online and offline​, with the e-commerce giant unveiling a new physical store with Amorepacific in Singapore.

With the opening of the AMORE Store X Lazada, Lazada Singapore CEO James Chang has boldly declared that Lazada is no longer an e-commerce company.

“We’re dropping the ‘e’ – we’re now a commerce company, not just e-commerce any more,”​ he said.

AMORE Store X Lazada is just the beginning of the firm’s venture into the world of new retail, which will be a point of focus for the company in the new year.

Chang told CosmeticsDesign-Asia​ that this move was essential given the shifting shopping behaviours of shoppers.

“When we launched Lazada in 2012, the consumer was shopping for structure products – things that are easy to compare and have specifications that can be easily communicated through pictures or text. ​

5 – Microbiome in China: Cosmetic trend will ‘heat up’ by the end of 2020, says expert

China is on the verge of a skin microbiome boom​ as consumers continue on their relentless quest for an “antidote to modern lifestyles”.​

Chinese consumers are aware that the reality of long working hours, environmental pollution and excessive screen time is negatively affecting the condition of skin, especially in fast-paced Chinese cities.

“There is a strong understanding of wanting to balance skin along with a real desire to see products rooted in scientific claims, which makes the microbiome a compelling topic over the coming years,”​ said Nicole Fall of Asian Consumer Intelligence.

However, Fall said the level of skin microbiome understanding among consumers was still very low. She observed that not many Chinese Key Opinion Leaders (KOL) were talking about skin microbiome or probiotic beauty.

“When we monitor KOLs, which are usually the first touchpoint for consumers to gain beauty knowledge in China, very few if any are talking about the microbiome. Some discuss probiotic skincare but even these influencers tend to be somewhat niche rather than the bigger names with lots of followers,” ​she said.
