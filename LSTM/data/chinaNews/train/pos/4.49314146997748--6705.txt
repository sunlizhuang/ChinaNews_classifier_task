HINGHAM — Children danced a Vietnamese folk tale set to original music Saturday morning at the Hingham Public Library, the first of many activities the library has planned for its new artist-in-residence program, created to honor the late Jane Murphy Gaughan.

The children worked with Nikki Hu, a choreographer, and Guy Van Duser, a musician, to learn a dance based on a Vietnamese folk tale called "The Raven and the Starfruit Tree." Through the program, the students bring storybook subjects to life and form a dance troupe: the Fly by Night Dancers.

"The kids are the story, that's always the formula," said Hu, 70, who has been doing similar programs for nearly four decades.

The "Fly by Night" program is the first project Hu worked on with Gaughan, who taught in Quincy but went on to develop a lasting relationship with Hingham schools, where she served as a librarian and worked on many creative projects with students. Gaughan and Hu met in the early 1980s, when Gaughan was the curator of education at the China Trade Museum in Milton - now the Forbes House Museum. Gaughan died in 2018.

With red-glittered lips and bright tinsel in her pink hair, Hu led the group slowly through the tale. Each part has a corresponding dance move, which will become more advanced as the sessions progress.

"It’s about empowering them to believe that they have a beautiful gift to deliver — their presence," Hu said. "It's a way for them to discover themselves and their potential."

The set is one of more than a dozen programs Hu and Van Duser teach to different age groups across many states and continents.

The children dance to music composed by Van Duser, who previously worked for Disney and teaches at Berklee College of Music. He also plays a wooden drum during part of the set.

Hu and Duser use large, laminated drawings, illustrated by children, to bring the story to life and connect it to each dance movement.

“It offers a multicultural experience; it's a new kind of programming for the library," Totsie McGonagle, the children’s librarian, said. “Watching the concentration on the children's’ faces was the best part. It was so much fun."

At future artists-in-residence programs, participants will also learn another Asian folk tale: "How Rat Became Number One."

The program will be held on two Saturdays each month through March from 9 to 10:30 a.m., culminating in a final performance on March 21. It's free for children ages 5 through 10, though caregivers are encouraged to participate.

"Opportunities like this are so rare and special,” Avis Goldstein, who provided the grant for the artists-in-residence program from a trust with her late husband, Harold Goldstein, said. “The library is the most important place.”
