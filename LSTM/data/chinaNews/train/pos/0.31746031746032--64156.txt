Netflix may not win for The Irishman at the 2020 Oscars, but the streaming service just took home the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature for American Factory. The Netflix documentary, which was produced by Barack and Michelle Obama, follows a former GM plant in Dayton, Ohio that shut down, only to re-open in 2016, now as a new branch of a Chinese glass company called Fuyao.

Though not overtly political, directors Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar told a story that speaks directly to the American worker. As the American workers featured in the documentary grow frustrated with their dangerous working conditions, pay, hours, and more, tensions boil over with their Chinese bosses, who are used to completely different standards of labor practices. This all eventually leads to a unionization effort, which becomes the driving narrative of the film. In the midst of the 2020 election, that story almost feels more political than ever.

Donald Trump is never mentioned by name in the film, though directors Reichert and Bognar told Decider in a previous interview that they had filmed many sequences of the 2016 election—only to cut those parts out. “We decided that the film is not about the political scene,” Reichert said.

Still, it’s impossible not to think of the 2016 election, Trump’s promise to bring back manufacturing jobs to Ohio, and his ongoing trade war with China while watching the film. It’s no wonder the Obamas chose American Factory for their first project for their production company, Higher Ground. A good choice, too—the Obamas are now officially Oscar winners!

As for Netflix, American Factory’s Oscar was the second win of the night for the streaming service, following Laura Dern winning Best Supporting Actress for Marriage Story. Not as many as the streaming service had hoped for, but not bad!
