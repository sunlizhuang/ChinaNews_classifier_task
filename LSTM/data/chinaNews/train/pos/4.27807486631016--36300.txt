Panoramic Resources awards underground mining contract for Savannah Nickel Mine

Panoramic Resources Ltd (ASX:PAN) has awarded the underground mining contract at its Savannah Nickel Mine in the Kimberley to Barminco and has updated production guidance for 2020.

The company is working with Barminco to finalise contract terms and develop a detailed mobilisation and implementation plan.

A newer mining fleet to be supplied by Barminco is expected to deliver enhanced equipment reliability, increase operational efficiencies and drive production volumes in the medium and longer term.



Transition to contract mining

Panoramic managing director and chief executive officer Victor Rajasooriar said: "The appointment of leading underground mining services provider Barminco as preferred contractor at Savannah is the result of a rapid but comprehensive external engagement and tender process.

"We look forward to working intensively with Barminco in transitioning Savannah to contract operations and progressively lifting underground production rates in a safe and sustainable manner."

The transition to contract mining at Savannah is expected by the end of the March quarter.
