President Tsai was re-elected with a record 57 per cent of the vote

China has criticised the United States for congratulating the President of Taiwan, claiming that “dark forces” were behind her landslide election victory, which has been regarded as a stunning rebuke to Beijing’s campaign to isolate the island.

Tsai Ing-wen was returned as president on Saturday with 57 per cent of the vote, a record since presidential elections began in 1996. Her party also held on to a majority in parliament, although it was reduced.

Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, and British and Japanese diplomats, congratulated President Tsai and the island’s democratic vote. Mr Pompeo said the US hailed her strength “in the face of unrelating pressure”.

Beijing, which considers Taiwan to be its territory, denounced their actions as violating the One China principle.
