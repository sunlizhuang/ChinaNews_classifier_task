What’s the single most talked-about achievement in cinematography this year? You can take your pick of Robert Richardson’s sun-dazed nostalgia porn in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood; Lawrence Sher’s seethingly grotty, wastebin vision of Gotham in Joker; Jarin Blaschke’s salt-flecked monochrome hellscapes for The Lighthouse; or Roger Deakins’ stitched, virtuosic tracking shots through the trenches in 1917 – all of them likely Oscar nominees.

The big one will be missing. It involves an hour-long, unbroken 3D shot – more jaw-dropping than anything in 1917, or Birdman, for that matter – which comprises the entire, hallucinatory second half of Bi Gan’s Chinese drama Long Day’s Journey into Night. This genuinely unbroken take required two months' preparation and seven attempts to get right; every critic who has seen the film has been staggered by it as a logistical achievement. It’s about as high-wire and technically astounding as filmmaking got in 2019.

So why aren’t Oscar voters allowed to pick it? Because the film, despite a worldwide gross of a not inconsiderable $42.1 million, has not been officially submitted by its distributor for Oscar consideration. When you consider that last year’s Best Cinematography category included no fewer than three non-English-language nominees – Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma, which won, beating Paweł Pawlikowski’s Cold War and the German biopic Never Look Away – this feels like an especially tough break.
