The Australian Government has restricted travel from mainland China into Australia to prevent further spread of the novel coronavirus. While there have been cases in mainland Australia, there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Tasmania and the risk of the coronavirus spreading to Tasmania is very low.

As always, the health and wellbeing of our students, staff and the broader community are our biggest concern. We have processes in place which deal with the unlikely spread of illness and we are working closely with the Public Health Office to ensure our approach aligns with current advice.

We ask everyone in our University community to follow health and government advisories closely and to do those things known to reduce the risk of getting coronavirus and similar illnesses.

Our values are to be an inclusive, respectful and supportive community, and we should be conscious of being supportive to all Chinese members of our community, in Tasmania and abroad.
