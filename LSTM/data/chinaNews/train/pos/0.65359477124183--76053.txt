Personal travel records to be accessible to all medical units

Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA) All hospitals, clinics and pharmacies in Taiwan will have access to patients' travel histories from Wednesday, a function currently limited to National Health Insurance (NHI)- appointed medical units, to better prevent the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus.

NHI Administration Chief Lee Po-chang (李伯璋) told CNA Tuesday that such access will provide some 1,500 medical units that operate independently of the NHI system with the information they need to provide the proper medical treatment.

Those units will be able to track patients' travel records via their national identification cards or in the case of foreign nationals, their alien resident certificates, Lee said.

The system, which shows travel records to China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore and Thailand over the past 30 days, is currently used by some 26,000 NHI-appointed medical units.
