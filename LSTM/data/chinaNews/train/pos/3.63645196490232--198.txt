WPP's Geometry, which bills itself as a creative commerce agency, has appointed Jesse Lin as APAC CEO.

Lin was most recently APAC CEO at Edelman, a role that he took up in late 2017 following the departure of David Brain. Lin resigned from Edelman in June last year. He replaces Diana Cawley, who has been Geometry's APAC CEO since 2016 when she joined from BBDO Shanghai. She has left to seek other opportunities, according to Geometry.

Prior to Edelman Lin was Greater China CEO with McCann. He has also held roles at DDB Shanghai, Wieden + Kennedy Shanghai, and Leo Burnett Hong Kong. Based in Shanghai, he will lead the company's more than 1100 employees in 17 cities, reporting to global CEO Beth Ann Kaminkow.

"With a proven track record of driving transformation for other world-class organizations in the APAC region, [Lin is] perfectly suited to deliver growth locally and globally for those clients navigating the new retail opportunities that the region presents," Kaminkow said in a release. She added that Lin's passion for commerce and his Shanghai residency place him "in our priority China market, which is leading in retail innovation".

Kaminkow also thanked Cawley for her "genuine commitment", calling her "a master operator of a complex regional landscape" who leaves Geometry "a strong and connected network focused on nurturing creativity to drive commercial growth for clients".

Lin said Geometry has a demonstrated willingness to innovate through its vision of commerce as a "ripe canvas for creativity" and he is looking forward to leading its "entrepreneurial" team.
