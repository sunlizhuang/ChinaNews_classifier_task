The mama dog which was found along a dirt road dragging a crate full of her puppies last week, has been rescued.

A father and son found the mama dog, which was tied to the crate with a blue belt, in Townsend, said Fox News.

They then bought the dogs to a shelter in Dairen.

Crammed inside the crate were four of her puppies.

“There was barely any room for them to turn around,” Mariana Hagan told WTOC 11.

Hagan, who serves as Director of McIntosh County Animal Services, also told the outlet that the mama dog, along with her pups, “smelled really, really bad” and that they were covered with fleas, ticks and feces when they were turned over.

They only recovered when volunteers took care of them.

“Everyone has since been fed, watered (they were very thirsty), vaccinated, dewormed, bathed and deflead,” according to Fox News, citing a Facebook post by the McIntosh County Animal Services.

The post also thanked and praised the father and son who rescued the canines.

The animals were flown to Fancy Cats and Dogs Rescue in Virginia where they will undergo further treatment and will be up for adoption in the future, added Fox News.

Hagan meanwhile said that whoever was responsible for such inhumane treatment could face several charges. Along this line, the Friends of McIntosh County Animal Services is offering a $250 reward for any information.
