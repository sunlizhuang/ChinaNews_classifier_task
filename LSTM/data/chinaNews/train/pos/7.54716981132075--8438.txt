The announcement came following Jaishankar's meeting with Vladimir Norov, the secretary-general of SCO, a transnational group comprising China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and India.

"Appreciated the SCO's efforts towards promoting tourism among member states. The eight wonders of SCO, which includes the State of Unity, will surely serve as an inspiration," reads the tweet.

The tallest statue in the world, the Statue of Unity was made a tribute to India's first home minister and deputy prime minister, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.

It was inaugurated in October 2018 on Patel's 143rd birth anniversary by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
