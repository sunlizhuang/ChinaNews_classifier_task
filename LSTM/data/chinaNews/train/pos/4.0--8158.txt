Porcelain designer Wu Anran checks the products designed by her which features the Chinese Year of the Rat in Jingdezhen, east China's Jiangxi Province, Jan. 8, 2020. Jingdezhen, also known as the "Capital of Porcelain", is famous for its elaborate ceramic craftsmanship which requires an extremely complicated production process. In the past, many young, competent and ambitious porcelain designers could create good designs but had difficulty in independently completing production and sales. On the other hand, traditional enterprises that could do production and sales lacked new designs. Jingdezhen explored effective ways of bringing together young designers with local large state-owned enterprises to benefit both sides. Young designers provide new designs and the companies provide loans and modernized production line. All products are tagged with the brands of both the manufacturer and the designer. At present, more than 200 porcelain designer brands are achieving mutual benefits with enterprises in this way. (Xinhua/Zhou Mi)
