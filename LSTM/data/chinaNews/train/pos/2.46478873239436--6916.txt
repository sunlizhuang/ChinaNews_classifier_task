KOTA SAMARAHAN: Sarawak will not allow divisive racial sentiments to enter and disrupt the state's multicultural harmony, says Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg (pic).

"We don't stir up racial sentiments here. There is nothing like this in Sarawak.

"Don't let it come to Sarawak," the Chief Minister said when launching the Sarawakku Sayang programme here on Monday (Jan 13).

Abang Johari said one reason why Sarawak's multiracial population got on well with one another was the many mixed marriages in the state.

"We have Ibans marrying Malays, Malays marrying Chinese and so on. The children of mixed marriages will not stir up racial issues because if they attack one race or another, they would be attacking their own father or mother.

"So there are no racial tensions in Sarawak," he said.

Abang Johari reiterated that he would be fair to all races in developing the state, adding that Sarawak was the first and only state to set up a Unit for Other Religions (Unifor).

"We provide assistance for non-Muslim places of worship. We believe that all religions teach their adherents to do good and be morally upright citizens," he said.

He also called on Sarawakians to remain united and work together to fulfil the late chief minister Tan Sri Adenan Satem's advice to look after Sarawak well.

"Before Tok Nan passed away, among his final words to us was 'jaga Sarawak baik baik' (take good care of Sarawak).

"Only Sarawakians can look after Sarawak because we understand our multiracial culture and society," he said.

Adenan died while in office on Jan 11, 2017, and Abang Johari was sworn in to succeed him two days later.
