YAOUNDE, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- Cameroon's Minister of Secondary Education, Pauline Nalova Lyonga, on Friday hailed as "excellent" the cooperation with China in high school education.

Lyonga made the remarks during a visit to the China-aided Technical and Professional Agricultural High School in Yabassi in the country's Littoral region.

"This institution is extremely important to the state of Cameroon and to the Ministry of Secondary Education," Lyonga told reporters."It is a clear representation of the excellent bilateral friendship between our two countries."

Created in 2016 as a fruit of Sino-Cameroon cooperation, the school disposes of modern infrastructure and logistics second to none in the country, the minister said.

"The Chinese are coming here with technical equipment to restore the standard of education. This is the training institution where we have agriculture and science and all of that put together," Lyonga said.

"We have to change the mentality of young people. They don't have to wait until they get to the university to get into the production. They can start producing as from now," she added.
