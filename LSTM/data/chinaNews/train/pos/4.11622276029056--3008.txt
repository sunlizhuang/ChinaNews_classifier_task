CANTON Stark County commissioners on Wednesday approved funding for several Stark County Job & Family Services initiatives.

The board unanimously approved a new affiliation agreement between DJFS and Aultman College of Nursing and Health Sciences. The yearlong agreement, which ends Nov. 20,�will allow an Aultman student to gain practical experience as an intern.

Robert Myers, deputy director of children services for DJFS, told the board an intern is expected to start in May. The student will accompany and observe caseworkers.

“They get their feet wet,” Myers said, adding that the intern could potentially be a future employee.

Commissioners also approved two contracts, effective through the 2020 calendar year, for the Right Path for Fathers Partnership program. One is a $30,000 contract with the Early Childhood Resource Center for fatherhood classes and peer support group meetings and the other a $50,000 contract with Goodwill Industries of Greater Cleveland and East Central Ohio for services related to job skills and employability.

Both contracts are for the 2020 calendar year.

Right Path for Fathers, which is in its seventh year, is operated by the DJFS’ Child Support Enforcement Division and several community partners. The program assists noncustodial parents, who have not worked for six months or more, with employment barriers and the child support system.

Other action:

– Approved three other resolutions related to DJFS: A $25,000 grant for the Ohio Accelerated Safety Analysis Protocol that prioritizes “high risk” Child Protective Services cases; a $230,000 subgrant to the Workforce Initiative Association for reimbursement of Comprehensive Case Management and Employment Program services; and authorization to participate in Kinnect’s 30 Days to Family program.

The latter involved no monetary commitment, said Stark County Administrator Brant Luther. Kinnect aims to place foster children with relatives and ensure they receive community support.

“Their role is to try to turn over every stone to try to find some relative that is available for placement,” he said.

– Agreed to seek a building, heating and electrical inspector to replace a retiree. The Building Department currently has three electrical inspectors, three building and heating inspector positions, and one inspector who does all three, according to a department chart. If another building, heating and electrical inspector is found, the vacant building and heating inspector position will not be filled, Luther said.

– Selected Commissioner Richard Regula as president and Commissioner Bill Smith as vice president of the board at an organizational meeting Tuesday.
