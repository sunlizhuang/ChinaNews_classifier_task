SHANGHAI, Feb 5 (SMM) – Copper prices extended their rally in early morning trade on Wednesday, as supportive measures from China’s central bank calmed investors’ concerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak.

Base metals prices on the LME cruised broadly higher on Tuesday, while most of their SHFE counterparts recovered partially from Monday’s plunge. The recovery in metals was in line with the stock markets.

China’s central bank has pumped in hundreds of billions of dollars into the financial system this week. It also trimmed some key lending rates and said it is determined to stabilise markets along with restoring confidence.

The SHFE has suspended night time trading until further notice.

Copper: Three-month LME copper rallied to its highest in about a week at $5,691/mt on Tuesday, before it gave back some gains to end the trading day 1.32% higher at $5,634.5/mt. Gains in copper prices were limited by a stronger US dollar, as US Treasury yields jumped. LME copper is expected to move between $5,630-5,680/mt today, with SHFE copper at 45,000-45,500 yuan/mt. Spot prices are seen at a discount of up to 30 yuan/mt to a premium of a maximum of 30 yuan/mt, as demand has yet to recover.

Aluminium: Three-month LME aluminium boomeranged on Tuesday, creeping up to an intraday high of $1,721/mt before sinking to a multi-year low of 1,685/mt. It finished the trading day 0.15% higher at $1,699/mt. It is expected to hover at $1, 680-1,730/mt today. The most traded SHFE 2003 contract is likely to move at 13,400-13,800 yuan/mt today.

Zinc: Three-month LME zinc climbed to a one-week high of $2,238/mt on Tuesday, before it eased to close the trading day 0.81% stronger at $2,182.5/mt. LME zinc was supported by the lower Bollinger band, but under pressure from the five-day moving average. Zinc inventories across LME warehouses continued to trend lower, declining 0.3% on the day to 49,625 mt. LME zinc is expected to trade between $2,160-2,210/mt today, with SHFE zinc at 17,000-17,500 yuan/mt. Spot premiums for domestic 0# Shuangyan are seen at 50-60 yuan/mt over the SHFE 2003 contract.

Nickel: Three-month LME nickel on Tuesday rose to its highest in more than a week at $13,365/mt, near the 20-day moving average, before it erased some gains to end the trading day 1.81% higher at $12,950/mt. Resistance at the 10-day moving average will come under scrutiny today.

Lead: Three-month LME lead rose to an intraday high of $1,878/mt on Tuesday, before it eased to close the trading day 0.52% stronger at $1,840/mt.

Tin: Three-month LME tin fluctuated to close the trading day 0.59% firmer at $16,275/mt. LME tin now resides around the five-day moving average. Support is seen at $16,000/mt, while resistance lies at the 10-day moving average at $16,500/mt.
