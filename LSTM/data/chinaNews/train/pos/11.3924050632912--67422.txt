MINSK, 11 February (BelTA) – China highly values the support and help that Chinese students receive in Belarus, BelTA learned from Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of China to Belarus Cui Qiming on 11 February.

“We are grateful to Belarus for the support and help Chinese students receive in Belarus in this difficult time. It is the feeling of friendship and care. I would also like to thank the leadership of your country for assistance and support in fighting the coronavirus,” Cui Qiming said.

In his words, Belarus was one of the first countries to send humanitarian aid to China. “The Belarusian government has twice sent aircraft to deliver humanitarian aid to China. I express gratitude on behalf of the Chinese embassy in Belarus,” he remarked.

The ambassador stressed that China stands united and makes every effort to fight the epidemic while maintaining an extremely responsible stance towards the world community. “We've taken the most rigorous measures to prevent and fight the epidemic. Results are being gradually achieved. The number of cured patients clearly exceeds the number of fatal cases while the spread of the disease is slowing down. The Chinese nation has never bowed down to any trials. We are completely confident we will beat the epidemic,” he added.

About 5,000 students from China are taught in Belarus nowadays. As many as 920 students left the country for the winter break.
