The judge approved the amount in an order filed Friday for Roxanne Conlin and her team who won former Iowa Workers' Compensation Commissioner Chris Godfrey a $1.5 million verdict.

Branstad, now U.S. ambassador to China, was found to have discriminated and retaliated against Godfrey in 2011 because he's gay.

Taxpayers have paid $2.9 million for Branstad's attorneys and will pay Conlin's fees if the state loses a pending Iowa Supreme Court appeal.
