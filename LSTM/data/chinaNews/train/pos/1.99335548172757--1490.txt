The "One Country, Two Systems" is the biggest advantage for Hong Kong and the motherland is Hong Kong's biggest support, Luo Huining, the new chief of the liaison office of the central government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region said at a brief and highly anticipated press conference on Monday, his first day in office.

"It is a new mission and a new challenge for me to work for the liaison office of the central government in Hong Kong," Luo said, noting that he is not unfamiliar with Hong Kong.

He stressed that Hong Kong people have made great contributions to the country's reform and opening-up and modernization construction.

"The past half year in Hong Kong has been distressing and we all sincerely hope that the city will get back on the right track," Luo said.

"One country, two systems" is Hong Kong's biggest advantage, he stressed.

Luo, 65, was announced as the new chief of the liaison office on Saturday.

He was also appointed vice-chairman of the Financial and Economic Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress on December 28, 2019. He previously served as Party chief of Northwest China's Qinghai Province and North China's Shanxi Province.

Luo visited Hong Kong in 2017 as provincial Party chief of Shanxi and met with Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam to discuss cooperation between Shanxi and Hong Kong, according to a statement issued by Lam on Saturday.

Lam said that under Luo's leadership the liaison office will continue to work with the Hong Kong government to fully implement the Basic Law and "one country, two systems" in the interest of Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
