Chinese gov't does not require Huawei to collect foreign data: ambassador to Germany

Chinese Ambassador to Germany Wu Ken said on Thursday night that the Chinese government does not require companies to collect foreign data, including the telecom giant Huawei.

"There are no laws in China requiring companies to collect foreign data and information, and Chinese companies are never required to use 'back doors' or other methods to collect or store data abroad for Chinese intelligence services," said Wu at an event in Berlin.

Wu added that Huawei is a completely private company in which the Chinese government does not invest a single cent. Its relationship with the Chinese government is no different from that between private companies and governments in other countries.

"The claim that Huawei has close ties to the Chinese government has no basis," said Wu.

"I just hope that the German side can create a fair, just, open and transparent market environment for Chinese companies in Germany," said Wu.
