SIR – New 5G networks are not just about communications. They will form the basis of the so-called “internet of things”, to which a vast range of consumer goods and commercial products, as well as military hardware, will be connected.

The provider of the network will specify the way these items are connected, which will in turn have a profound effect on their actual design.

Since China is already the largest source of electrically powered consumer goods in the UK, its manufacturing firms will, if allowed, form numerous partnerships with Huawei to achieve a virtual monopoly of the UK and other Western electrical goods markets.

The way for Britain to work with Huawei on 5G is through a formal joint venture with a wholly British-owned company set up for the purpose by the Government. Huawei would provide the technology in return for access to the UK market. The exploitation of any technology generated by the joint venture would be shared too. This would protect British security from the inside, vastly enhance British industrial capability, and be a real test of Huawei’s sincerity.

SIR – Charles Moore is quite right to highlight the risks of China’s involvement in our core infrastructure.

All attention may currently be on Huawei, but meanwhile China General Nuclear, also blacklisted by the United States, is EDF’s partner in building Hinkley Point nuclear power station, is a potential partner in the proposed plant at Sizewell C in Suffolk, and wants to build its own reactor at Bradwell in Essex.
