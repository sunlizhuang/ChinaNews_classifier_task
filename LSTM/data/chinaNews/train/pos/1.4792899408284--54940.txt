Vegetables, melons, herbs, and berries: Winter vegetables are in various stages of growth. Certified producers are planting winter vegetables. Blueberries are being pruned and prepared for the winter. Young pea plants continue to grow with some flowering. Strawberries continue to progress well.

Livestock and poultry: Rangeland grasses have germinated and are growing well. Irrigated pastures are in good to excellent condition. Non-irrigated pastures are in better condition from the recent rains which have been a great benefit for the rangeland forage. Local cattle ranchers are welcoming the new growth of winter grass in the foothills that will help feed their range cattle this spring. Fed-cattle price is at $120 per cwt.

Cut flowers are being imported from Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Colombia to flower shops in Tulare County. Ground water storage basins in parts of Tulare County are beginning to fill with runoff.
