Weber Shandwick has announced the appointment of Tyler Kim to vice-chair, Asia Pacific. He will continue with his current roles of managing director, North Asia (excluding China) and head of crisis communications, Asia Pacific.

In the expanded role, Kim will be tasked with driving the outbound business strategy helping Asia-based clients build their businesses abroad while continuing to oversee operations in Korea and Japan. He will work closely with Darren Burns, vice-chair, Asia Pacific, who currently leads the firm’s corporate innovation, marketing and new business development strategy. Both Kim and Burns continue to report to Baxter Jolly, CEO, Asia Pacific.

“Tyler has been a key driver of Weber Shandwick’s Asia business success this past decade. He has built our Korean business – now one of our most successful markets – from the ground up. He’s bolstered our Japan business on the back of his North Asia appointment, and has partnered with some of the world’s most recognized Korea- and Japan-based brands on their global expansion,” said Jolly.

“Tyler’s deep roots and success building our regional network, combined with his global outlook and expertise, will be invaluable to Asia-based clients looking for strategic and sustained business solutions in the global marketplace.”
