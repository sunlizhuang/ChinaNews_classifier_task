The Allen County Health Department today joined U.S. and international authorities in warning against the new strain of coronavirus.

The federal Department of State Thursday banned travel to China by U.S residents, and the World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern because of the the rapidly spreading outbreak.

Dr. Deborah McMahan, health commissioner, today in a statement said those travelling anywhere internationally should consult their physician or the health department for recommendations.

"We are very aware of the international travel that begins in Fort Wayne," she said.

Although no vaccine exists for the new strain of coronavirus, the health department has sent a letter to local businesses alerting them to its travel immunization clinic.

The clinic provides recommended vaccines at cost plus an administrative fee.

There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Allen County. But the virus, identified in Wuhan, China, has spread to thousands of people there and has been detected in several other countries, including the United States. More than 100 cases have proved fatal.

A sixth U.S. case, in Chicago, became the first documented U.S. case of person-to-person transmission, health officials announced Thursday.
