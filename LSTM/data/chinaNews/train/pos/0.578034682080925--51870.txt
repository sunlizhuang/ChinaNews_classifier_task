BELLEVILLE, NJ â€” The Belleville Historical Society's latest effort to share the township's Chinese-American heritage is now on display at the Belleville Public Library, 221 Washington Avenue.

Through Feb. 10, a full-size rickshaw will be on exhibit, part of the society's effort to commemorate the Chinese New Year.

Last week, the Qing Dynasty Imperial flag was raised at a ceremony at Belleville Town Hall. The yellow, three-sided dragon flag flew in Belleville during Chinese New Year throughout the 1870's and 1880's.

2020, the Year of the Rat, also marks the 150th anniversary of the establishment of the first Chinese community on the east coast of the U.S., according to Belleville Historical Society President Michael Perrone.

"Belleville, not New York, was home to the first Chinese community established in September of 1870," Perrone told Patch.

Perrone will give a talk on Belleville's unique place in Chinese-American history on Monday, Feb. 10 at noon, the last day the rickshaw will be on display. (Learn more about this local event)
