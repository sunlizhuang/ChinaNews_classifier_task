These four Individual Awards videos were posted on the social media platforms in China and with nearly 5.3 million views, the entry “Kungfu Kangaroo” won the Most Popular in China Award. As Michael was unable to participate in the ceremony in Brisbane, his father Rami Moryosef received the award, given by Dr. Xu Jie, Consul-General of the People’s Republic of China in Brisbane and the Honourable Chief Justice Catherine Holmes, Acting Governor of Queensland.

Michael is currently almost graduated from a double Law and International Studies Degree from the University of New South Wales in Australia. He has been learning Mandarin for 18 months in Beijing. During this time, he has developed a fascination with the way in which China represents both an ancient culture and cutting-edge modernity. “The Chinese WeChat application epitomizes this combination”, he said. That is why he made this video sharing his experience with WeChat.

Michael will be invited to China for a one-week cultural experience trip. “I am absolutely thrilled to have been awarded this year's Most Popular Video. I cannot wait to return to China and continue to explore the land, eat the food, and make new friends along the way.”
