Venezuelan foreign minister thanks China for its permanent support

Beijing, Jan 16 (Prensa Latina) Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza on Thursday thanked China for its permanent support in defending sovereignty and sponsoring the political dialogue process to solve the situation in Venezuela.

During a meeting with Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan, the Venezuelan diplomat noted that Beijing has always sought joint formulas to move forward with bilateral cooperation despite the constant US aggressions.



Arreaza indicated that his official visit to China is part of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two nations, whose ties have greatly developed since 2001 with more than 500 joint projects, binational funds, energy production and collaboration in several economic areas.



Arreaza will meet this Thursday with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and Communist Party authorities.



The Venezuelan foreign minister arrived in China on Wednesday evening and will be here until Sunday, to review issues of the bilateral and international agenda.
