VACAVILLE — The Chinese American Association of Solano County will celebrate “The Year of the Rat” at its 24th Annual Chinese New Year Celebration on Saturday. This event is always a sellout with an attendance of more than 400 annually.

The festivities include an authentic Chinese dinner, traditional Chinese Lion Dance, cultural performances, prize drawings, awarding of scholarships and recognition of outstanding contributors and leaders in our community. This is an opportunity for you to contribute and in turn be recognized.

The celebration will take place from 5 to 8 p.m. at Yin Ranch, 6319 Pleasants Valley Road.

The goal is to offer scholarships to graduating high school and current community college students from all ethnic backgrounds in Solano County, as our collective future is directly dependent upon the education of our youth. Proceeds from this event directly benefit the association’s scholarship program.

The Chinese New Year Celebration is the group’s largest annual fundraising effort.
