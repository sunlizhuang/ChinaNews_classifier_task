Since Jan. 25, the ChangHeber Company located in Changchun city has been producing the famous Cuban antiviral, which is one of 30 medicines chosen by the National Health Commission for its potential to cure respiratory diseases.

ChangHeber, Biotech, and Changchun Heber Biological Technology are three companies that have joined forces within the framework of Chinese-Cuban cooperation in the biotechnology sector, which has wide prospects for future economic growth.​​​​​​
