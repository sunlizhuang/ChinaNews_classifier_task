Last year, Marvel Comics and Wacom, a Japanese-based company popular with artists for their graphic tablets, joined forces to conduct a nationwide talent search throughout China. Now Marvel is beginning to show off the work of artists they discovered during the search in a series of "Chinese New Year" variant covers.

“It was a thrill for me to visit art schools and conventions around China last year as part of this massive talent search!” says Editor-in-Chief C.B. Cebulski in a press release. “We reviewed hundreds of submissions and these covers are by the artists whose unique visual styles we felt best captured the Marvel characters. We hope fans love them as much as we do as Marvel continues our global approach to discovering diverse artistic voices!”

The first artist to get the spotlight, Jie Yuan, has illustrated three Spider-Man title covers that interconnect - Symbiote Spider-Man: Alien Reality #3, Amazing Spider-Man #39 and Gwen Stacy #1. All go on sale February 12.

Check out all the covers and the connected version in our gallery.
