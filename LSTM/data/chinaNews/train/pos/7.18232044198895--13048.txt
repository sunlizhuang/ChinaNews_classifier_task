It never hurts to listen in on a bit of Feng Shui especially when it comes to joining in the many Chinese New Year celebrations across the country.

For the Year of the Yang Golden Rat which unfolds on January 25, The Manila Times Look Book sought the expertise of geomancer Patrick Lim Fernandez — brother of the late and beloved Princesse Lim Fernandez of the noted Yin & Yang Shop of Harmony at New World Hotel Manila — on what he suggests as lucky looks for everyone to wear on the eve of Chinese New Year.





“Red is still the go-to color in welcoming the Lunar New Year as always and no matter what the lucky colors of the year are, this one is a staple,” he related. “But specifically for the coming year of the Golden Rat, you could also mix the red with a bit of green for added luck!”

A principal at the Yin & Yang Shop of Harmony, Patrick combines his business, finance, and real estate background with classical Feng Shui traditions to create fundamentally sound and analytically driven recommendations. His readings guide clients in achieving success in money and business luck.

He is all set to lead the annual celebration of Chinese New Year’s Eve on January 24 at the Grand Ballroom of the New World Makati Hotel. The event entitled “The Year of the Dashing Golden Rat” will be presented by ODV Creative Media Inc. and The Yin & Yang Shop of Harmony. Event tickets are available at the Yin & Yang Shop of Harmony.
