ROME, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- Italy's head of state Sergio Mattarella hosted an extraordinary concert on Thursday, showing solidarity with the Chinese people dealing with the coronavirus emergency.

Held at the Quirinale Palace, the special event, within the framework of Italy-China year of culture and tourism 2020, was performed by Chinese-born Italian pianist Jin Ju before a mixed audience of Italian and Chinese officials, cultural representatives and students.

Chinese Ambassador to Italy Li Junhua attended the performance, which was broadcast live by state-run RAI radio and TV channels.

"This concert highlights the relevance our country attaches to the Italy-China year of culture and tourism 2020, and it represents a sign of friendship from the Italian people to the Chinese people," Mattarella told media before the concert.

He highlighted that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between Rome and Beijing, a relationship "shaped on the base of mutual friendship and common interest."

"Italy conveys to China its faith and support in this emergency against the epidemic, and in the (Chinese) efforts to ensure health safety," said the president, adding that the ongoing epidemic is a common enemy.

Jin Ju performed seven pieces overall at the concert, including the Chinese folk music "Honghu Waters, Wave upon Wave," which comes from Hubei province -- the place hit hardest by the current epidemic.

The China-Italy year of culture and tourism kicked off here on Jan. 21. It would see a wide range of cross-cultural events in both countries.
