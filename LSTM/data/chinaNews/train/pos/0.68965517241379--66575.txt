These retailers have promised to guarantee the supply of grain, edible oil, vegetables and other daily necessities, and refrain from forestalling goods and jacking up prices. Their chain stores cover most of cities at prefectural level and above in China.

A woman surnamed Chen in Beijing ordered fresh vegetables, chine and cherries imported from Chile from Hema, Alibaba's fresh food supermarket, through its app on the morning of Feb. 8. At 4:10 p.m., a deliveryman delivered the fresh food to her at the scheduled time. “The platform has resumed normal operation with a variety of goods,” Chen said.

A staff from Alibaba said supply of products in Hema remains stable, and it also directly deliver fresh vegetables and fruits to residents together with its vegetable and fruit bases.

To provide a safe environment for customers amid the epidemic, the chain stores have carried out disinfection operations and enhance protection of their staff. In general, they disinfect the ground, shopping carts and baskets and handrails twice a day or more.

Stable price of daily necessities help reassure people staying home for quarantine, said Zhao Ping, director of the international trade research department under the Academy of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade.

Noting that China has established sound reserve mechanism of important materials, including grain and pork, Zhao said it’s necessary for the country to establish a stable guarantee mechanism of anti-epidemic supplies.
