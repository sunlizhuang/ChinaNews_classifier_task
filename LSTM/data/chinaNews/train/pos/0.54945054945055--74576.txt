CWN Editor's Note: “More and more, the Church is under persecution” in China, Cardinal Joseph Zen told the Catholic News Agency. The retired Bishop of Hong Kong reported that young people are not allowed in churches, crucifixes have been removed from sanctuaries and flags moved in, the national anthem is sung as Mass, Christmas celebrations are banned. The “underground” Church is doomed, Cardinal Zen says. “Even in the ‘official’ Church, the faithful are more and more controlled.”
