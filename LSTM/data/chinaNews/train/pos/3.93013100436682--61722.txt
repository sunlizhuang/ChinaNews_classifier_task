CANTON-Spoon River College wants your gently used shoes to help fund scholarships for dual credit students.

Eve Zimmerman, dual credit coordinator, is working with the for-profit social enterprise company Funds2Orgs on the shoe drive.

“They pay us based on the number of shoes collected, and then they donate the shoes to ‘micro-entrepreneurs’ throughout the world who can sell the shoes in their communities for a sustainable income,” said Zimmerman.

“It helps our students, others, and the environment by keeping unwanted shoes out of the landfills.”

Collection boxes are located at all SRC locations as well as the following participating high schools: Cuba, Canton, Lewistown, Macomb, Rushville, Spoon River Valley, and VIT.

“We want to thank everyone who has donated so far. In just the first week we collected more than 100 pairs of shoes, and we hope folks will continue to clean out their closets and bring us more,” Zimmerman said.

The dual credit program at Spoon River College provides the opportunity for eligible high school students to get a head start on their college education by taking college courses before they graduate. Information about that program can be viewed at www.src.edu.

The drive continues until March 27. For more information contact eve.zimmerman@src.edu or at 309-649-6221. For more information about Funds2Orgs, visit https://funds2orgs.com/why-shoes/.
