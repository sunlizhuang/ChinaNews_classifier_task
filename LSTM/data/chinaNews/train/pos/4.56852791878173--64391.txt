The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) said today it is ready to support China through public health infrastructure loans to meet the country's immediate and longer-term public health needs.

It has been in discussions with Chinese authorities to strengthen the emergency public health infrastructure, the bank said in a statement on its website.

"With the full impacts of the novel coronavirus epidemic still unknown, we want to do our part as residents of China to help stop its spread," said AIIB President Jin Liqun.

The bank will work with the Chinese government to identify effective investments in public health infrastructure.

AIIB also looks forward to working with other multilateral development banks, private partners and others to join hands in bolstering China and other members' ability to respond to and deal with epidemics and other public health emergencies, he said.

These types of investments will not only improve the health of Chinese citizens but can have a global impact in terms of prevention and education, according to Jin.

AIIB is a multilateral development bank that aims to support the building of infrastructure in the Asia-Pacific region.
