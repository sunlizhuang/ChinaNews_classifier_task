DAB lawmakers say the Financial Secretary Paul Chan has not responded to their proposal for a HK$10,000 cash handout immediately for Hong Kong permanent residents.

The pro-Beijing DAB Party is calling on the government to and out HK$10,000 to every Hong Kong permanent resident immediately, instead of waiting for the budget that will be presented in two weeks, RTHK reports.

The party said the cash should be seen as a special subsidy to residents in the face of the coronavirus which is spreading and the economic downturn.

Lawmakers from the party said they have made a proposal to the Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po in a meeting in the morning today.

They said the money can be used to help people buy protective masks or daily necessities and assist those who have lost their jobs.

The lawmakers said the secretary did not give a direct response to them. DABâ€™s vice-chairman Holden Chow said the government should make the move as soon as possible.

"In the light of the current coronavirus crisis, I think the government should provide every permanent Hong Kong residents HK$10,000 cash handout as soon as possible," he said.

Chow said people are suffering from loss of income due to business downturn and government should alleviate their pain.

Another pro-government ally, the Federation of Trade Union (FTU) said on Tuesday also had raised demand for a HK$10,000 to all Hongkongers, but they wanted it to be announced in the budget on February 26.
