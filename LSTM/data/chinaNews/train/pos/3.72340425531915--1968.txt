2019 was Bentley's 100th anniversary and the UK automaker ended the year with a sales increase. The company sold 11,006 cars in 2019, marking a five percent increase over 2018 as greater availability for models like the Bentley Continental GT W12 and Bentley Bentayga V8 attracted new customers in foreign markets. This is the seventh consecutive year Bentley has sold over 10,000 vehicles, spurred by growth in the company's biggest markets.

The Americas was Bentley's largest market yet again with 2,913 units sold while Europe and the UK also posted gains. "It's remarkable that this achievement was largely without any sales of the Flying Spur which historically has contributed 20 percent of our annual sales," said Adrian Hallmark, Chairman, and CEO of Bentley Motors. The Flying Spur recently entered production but did not go on sale in 2019. China was one of Bentley's only markets to post a decline in 2019, which can likely be attributed to the unavailable Flying Spur with its large back seat.
