Hayward Tyler has been awarded a £2 million contract to supply a glandless pump package to Chinese EPC Shanghai Electric (Group) Corporation, for installation at Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park Phase IV, a 950MW concentrating solar power (CSP) and photovoltaic hybrid IPP in Dubai.

The project will use three different technologies to generate clean energy: 600MW from a parabolic basin complex; 100MW from a solar tower; and 250MW from PV panels.

Hayward Tyler’s glandless pump packages will be a critical part of the SGS (Solar Tower Steam Generator System) and consist of six forced-circulating pumps and four start-circulating pumps. The pumps will serve the 100MW CSP Tower.

“This contract represents a major opportunity for Hayward Tyler, and the largest ever for our China facility,” said Alvin Sim, managing director for Hayward Tyler Asia Pacific.

“We are elated that our proprietary glandless pumps will contribute to this ambitious project,” said Mike Turmelle, managing director of the Engineered Pumps and Motors Division of Avingtrans plc, the parent company of Hayward Tyler. “We’re proud to be part of the clean energy market.”

Hayward Tyler has supplied more than 300 glandless pump units to Shanghai Electrical Group over the past three decades.
