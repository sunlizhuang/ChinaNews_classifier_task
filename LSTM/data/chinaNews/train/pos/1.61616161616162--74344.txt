GM: to wind down operations in Australia and New Zealand

(CercleFinance.com) - GM is winding down sales, design and engineering operations in Australia and New Zealand, and also plans to stop its local Holden brand by 2021, the US carmaker said on Monday.





The Detroit-based company said it will henceforth focus on the GM specialty vehicle business, finding itself unable to earn an adequate return on these markets.



The company also announced that it has signed a binding agreement with China's Great Wall Motors to sell its Rayong vehicle manufacturing facility in Thailand.



GM also plans to withdraw its Chevrolet brand from the domestic market in Thailand by the end of 2020.



As a result of these measures, the auto giant expects to incur net cash charges of approximately 300 million dollars, which will increase to 1.1 billion dollars including non-cash charges.



In markets where GM lacks critical mass, such as Japan, Russia and Europe, the carmaker is now pursuing a "niche" presence by selling profitable, high-end imported vehicles - supported by a lean structure, it said.
