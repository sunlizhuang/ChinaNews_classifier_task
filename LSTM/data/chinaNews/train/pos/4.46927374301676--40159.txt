Chinese laundry detergent company, ADA Manufacturing Limited is looking to increase its portfolio of third-party manufactured products.

It has begun a new campaign, including posts on Facebook and emails, inviting detergent retailers and manufacturers to have their products manufactured and packaged at its St Catherine-based facilities.

The offer to laundry market participants says, “Let ADA manufacture your detergent for you with your own label right here in Jamaica.”

ADA Manufacturing was formed by Steven Chin in 2010. Its operational facility is located on Trade Way in the Portmore Town Centre.

The company also manufactures and distributes its own brand of laundry detergent, namely Classic Sud, Nice and Clean, ADA Gold, ADA Ultra-clean powder detergent with softener, ADA Super-clean fragrant softener and ADA Floral Fresh.

ADA Manufacturing has over time, expanded product lines to include baby products, baby diaper, baby wipes, dishwashing liquid, laundry bar, bath soap, scented and regular candles, foil paper and Air Condition units.

It is also exporting to other Caribbean countries including Trinidad and Tobago.
