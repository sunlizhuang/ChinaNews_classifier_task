MAN Cryo has signed a contract to supply the LNG fuel gas supply systems to Wallenius SOL, in connection with the construction of two RoRo newbuildings in China at the Yantai Raffles shipyard.

MAN Cryo is MAN Energy Solutions’ marine LNG fuel-gas-system manufacturer, whilst Wallenius SOL is a Swedish shipping line. MAN Energy Solutions has also been selected to supply two 9L28/32DF dual-fuel auxiliary engines to each vessel. Wallenius SOL claims these vessels will run on LNG, making them among the most environmentally efficient vessels in that part of the world. Once complete, the vessels will be the largest to ever meet Finnish/Swedish ice class 1A Super standard, ensuring year-round service in the frozen Gulf of Bothnia.

Each of the 242 m newbuildings will have a sailing speed of 20 knots and a capacity of 5800 lane metres. According to the statement, delivery of the vessels is scheduled for 2021, and the order includes an option for two further vessels.

Louise Andersson, Head of MAN Cryo, said: “These RoRos will operate in a sensitive, sulfur-emission-control area in harsh winter conditions where a reliable LNG fuel-gas supply system is of the utmost importance. We are very pleased that both shipyard and shipowner trust us to deliver the fuel-gas supply system for such unique vessels.”

MAN Cryo’s scope of supply for the vessels covers the following:

Two 685 m3 vacuum tanks including tank connection spaces (TCSs) with LNG fuel pumps.

Bunker stations with a capacity of 500 m 3 /hr.

/hr. Automation, emergency shutdown and gas-detection systems.

MAN Cryo claims that tanks mounted under-deck with air locks will allow the amount of fresh air sucked into the tank rooms to be reduced to a minimum. This is an important consideration in the tough winter conditions the ships are set to operate in, where the amount of cold air in the vessels needs to be kept to a minimum.
