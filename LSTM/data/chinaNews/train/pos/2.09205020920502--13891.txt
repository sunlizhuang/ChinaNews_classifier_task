Migrant workers boarded a special train decorated with paper-cuttings and lanterns from Shanghai to Guiyang, Southwest China's Guizhou Province, on Jan 14.

Along with the festive environment on the train, activities such as cultural performance, health checkups and legal consulting were also offered.

The custom, proposed by the province's local Federation of Trade Unions, has been practiced for four years during the Spring Festival travel rush.

This year, the activities will be held through Jan 22 on eight high-speed trains and 13 normal trains arriving in Guizhou, officials said.

Data shows nearly 4 million people from Guizhou work in cities across China.
