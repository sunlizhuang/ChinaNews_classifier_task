A Cambodian passenger (left) has had a bag containing valuable items which were left on a Vietnam Airlines flight returned.

The cabin crew of flight VN522 from Ho Chi Minh City to Shanghai on January 4 found a bag left at a business class seat of a female Cambodian woman after all the passengers had left. Checking the bag they found some valuable jewellery including diamond rings and a watch.

The cabin crew reported the findings but it took time for Vietnam Airlines staff to contact the passenger as she had left to another city and did not have a mobile phone number.

Vietnam Airlines finally contacted the passenger and returned her the bag when she came to check in for a Shanghai-Ho Chi Minh City flight on January 11.

The passenger was happy to receive her lost bag and sent her sincere thanks to Vietnam Airlines staff.



This is not the first case in which passengers have had valuables returned. In 2018, the chief attendant of a Vietnam Airlines flight returned USD13,000 to a passenger, and a male attendant also returned a wallet containing VND30 million and some personal papers to another passenger. Dtinews
