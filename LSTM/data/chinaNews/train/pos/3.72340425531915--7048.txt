TUNIS, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese embassy in Tunisia held a cultural show on Sunday evening to celebrate the Chinese New Year at the City of Culture in Tunis, capital of Tunisia.

This show, including singing and dancing performances retracing a large part of Chinese culture and civilization, was broadcast live on Tunisian state television the Nationale 1.

Over 900 spectators attended the show, which has provided the audience with a visual feast of traditional Chinese operas, instrument solos, magic shows and acrobatics.

This festival coincided with the 56th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between Tunisia and China.

In recent years, Chinese culture has become more and more influential in Tunisia, Fatima, a student studying Chinese at the Confucius Institute in Tunisia, told Xinhua, while hoping to watch more Chinese cultural performances.
