CANTON, Mo. -- Plans are in place for Culver-Stockton College to have a fourth sorority for women on campus in the coming months.

Christian Thompson, coordinator of fraternity and sorority life at C-SC, says the groundwork to add the Zeta Zeta chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc., began during the fall semester of 2018. The chapter at C-SC will be partnering with a chapter at Truman State University in Kirksville.

A meeting for women interested in membership was held with national Delta Sigma Theta representatives on Jan. 25 at Truman State.

"We welcome Delta Sigma Theta as an organization that promotes academic excellence and its commitment to community service initiatives," Thompson said. "To have a fourth sorority is pretty big. It's a really good deal for our campus."

Delta Sigma Theta will be joining three sororities on campus -- Chi Omega (founded at C-SC in 1867), Sigma Kappa (founded at C-SC in 1947) and Sigma Sigma Sigma (founded at C-SC in 2005). Figures through Oct. 31, 2019, show about 175 female students are members of one of the three C-SC sororities.

Thompson said a timeline for when and how the sorority will be created has not been determined, but it will welcome new members this spring.

C-SC also has six fraternities, of which about 190 male students are members.
