Anne Li, 64, from South Africa, has lived in Tongxiang for 10 years and is now a foreign teacher at a local middle school.

Asked why she decided to volunteer, Li said that "this is what I have to do. I have been in Tongxiang for a long time. This is my second hometown, and the people here need my help."

"I'm not afraid. I believe I can protect myself. I believe my school and the Tongxiang government can protect us," Li said, adding that she is touched that her community has often called to enquire about her health condition.

Another volunteer, Jade, is also a teacher from South Africa. She is currently teaching at an experimental primary school.

"It is very necessary to do volunteer work, and I hope that through our practical actions, more people will know how to do a good job of safety protection,” said Jade, adding that she will take part in more volunteer activities in her school and her community.

"Are you volunteers? You are so awesome!" Wu Jianyu, a citizen who had just come to buy food, said excitedly when he saw foreign friends volunteering.

"You are so wonderful! We want to learn from you!" Wu couldn't stop giving them the thumbs up, and asked to take photos with the volunteers.

Volunteers from all walks of life, regardless of national boundaries, are coming together at this moment to take part in epidemic prevention and control work, and have become an important force supporting the local communities in China.
