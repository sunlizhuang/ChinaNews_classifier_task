DFNI has partnered with Chinese marketing consultancy Emerging Communications for a series of qualitative interviews with Chinese influencers on their preferences and opinions on duty-free shopping.

For our next interview, we hear from Miny, a fashion and lifestyle KOL, who boasts 1.64 million followers on Weibo and is a regular traveller to Europe, Australia and America.

The interview is followed by a commentary on the key takeaways from Miny’s responses by Marie Tulloch, Senior Client Services Manager at Emerging Communications.

DFNI: Which is your favourite airport to shop duty free, and why?

Miny: European duty free stores such as Paris Charles de Gaulle, as they have good discounts and coupons, and also you get a 5 percent discount for use of the Union Pay credit card.

Why do you shop in duty free? Feel free to discuss more than one critieria: price/exclusives/range/time to shop/authenticity/gifting/unique products?

Because I am usually travelling for work, I don’t have a lot of time to shop. Not only are duty-free products more reliable, but I also only need to go early to the airport and I can buy airport exclusives as gifts.

What are you most likely to buy in duty free, and why?

Handbags, shoes, clothes, jewellery and watches.

Are you on the lookout for particular brands in duty free, and if so, which ones?

Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Gucci and Bulgari.

Do you compare prices? If yes, online in advance of travel or at the store?

As I go abroad a lot, I am quite knowledgeable about prices, I know buying in duty free is definitely cheaper than buying domestically in China, and if I feel I can get good value I will just buy it.

Where are you most likely to shop if not in duty free – downtown / online?

Downtown shopping centres such as Printemps in Paris.

How important to you is service / staff interaction in duty free stores?

Very important, as this allows me to find the products I like, and recommendations I like in the shortest amount of time, which is critical.

Allow discounts on card payment – as well as product discounts – as these are a great way to draw in Chinese customers.

What is your biggest criticism of duty free retail?

For some, their styles are outdated / not the newest season.

What should duty free retailers do to improve the retail experience for Chinese travellers?

Allow discounts on card payment as well as product discounts as these are a great way to draw in Chinese customers.

How relevant have you found travel retail exclusive products for Chinese New Year – did they hit the mark?

Not really.

Key takeaways

by Marie Tulloch, senior client services manager, Emerging Communications

Value and exclusive products

Miny reveals she is a discriminating shopper with a keen focus on luxury buying, service, exclusive offers and discounts. This reflects the expectations and desires of most Chinese international travellers, the majority of which are wealthy Millennials who are used to being highly pampered by brands and retailers at home in China.

Finding good value is central to Miny’s shopping, and discount promotions are sought along with the benefit she sees in using her Union Pay credit card. Although Alipay mobile payment is the preferred pay format for most Chinese tourists because it gives the best exchange rate, and the platform provides destination based guides to retailers and unique user offers, Union Pay is still popular, particularly for high-value purchases. This highlights the need for duty-free retailers to enable use of the three commonly used Chinese payment methods, the third being WeChat Pay.

The standard of service is clearly important to Miny, and is a reflection of the high level of instore experience Chinese shoppers have come to expect. However, where Miny differs from most travellers is in being aware of the pricing in duty free outlets. The overwhelming majority of tourists use social media to research products and prices weeks, or even months before departure date. Retailers that digitally flag product lines, pricing and offers, and allow travellers to purchase in advance for pick up at the airport generate significant sales.

Luxury savings and the importance of marketing

Unlike most of the other KOLs questioned in this research series, Miny does not mention the appeal of being able to buy local premium brands, or localised variants of international products. These are benefits of overseas travel keenly sought by Chinese millennials, but may not be a factor for Miny because she is a frequent traveller, and therefore they are common to her. But she does seek exclusives, which is another key buying motivation for most Chinese tourists. Being able to obtain the unobtainable at home, whether a localised product or limited edition has major appeal to the millennial buyer.

Miny has a definite eye for making price savings, for big name luxury brands, and she also emphasises the fact that duty free outlets are reliable in the sense that they do not sell fake products.

Chinese New Year marketing clearly does not impress, and it is reasonable to assume other seasonal promotions such as those for Moon Festival and Golden Week will also fail to hit the mark. Most retailers in the West need to learn how to utilise the sales potential of Chinese holidays more effectively. But Miny’s biggest criticism is for outdated stock. Clearly the ability to buy the latest products and fashion are important, and again this is crucial for Chinese travellers who want the latest thing, particularly if it is not on sale back home.

The recommendation to flag big name bag brands and skincare products are the final points made. This should apply as much to online marketing as instore. As previously mentioned, Chinese travellers religiously research shopping itineraries well ahead of leaving home, and the easier it is for them to identify what is available and on offer, the greater the amount they will spend.
