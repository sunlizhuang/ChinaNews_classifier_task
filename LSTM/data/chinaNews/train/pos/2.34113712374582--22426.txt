If you wanted to purchase any official wedding souvenirs from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s 2018 royal wedding, you are out of luck on the Royal Collections website as they have now been sold out.

The website no longer features any souvenirs or memorabilia for the Sussexes and searching “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex” or “Sussexes” brings up no results. Items used to feature china plates, mugs and other things like pillboxes.

As recently as a few days ago, some items were available for purchase on the site. At that time, the royal wedding pillbox was on the site at a reduced price from £35 to £10 while a miniature mug went from £19.95 to £10.

A Royal Collections spokesperson said that china items like the ones sold for royal weddings are only sold for a limited time, “Many of Royal Collection Trust’s china ranges are produced to celebrate a specific occasion and are sold for a limited time.

“The china range to celebrate the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex has sold out.”

The souvenirs selling out and leaving the website comes after the Duke and Duchess announced their desire to step back from their senior royal roles. After discussions with the Royal Family, Harry and Meghan will no longer be working royals, use their HRH styles, or taking public funding as of spring 2020.

Most items celebrating Princess Eugenie’s 2018 wedding to Jack Brooksbank are also sold out; however, they still feature on the site with a ‘sold out’ marker.

There is still plenty of royal merchandise to choose from on the site as china celebrating The Queen becoming the longest-reigning monarch is still available.
