Washington, Jan 22 (IANS) China and the United States should strengthen strategic communication and look at each other rationally, Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, said.

Speaking at a Spring Festival reception hosted by the Chinese embassy, Tiankai said on Tuesday that China-US relations have achieved historic development since the establishment of their diplomatic ties, which has not only brought about great benefits to the two peoples but also helped promote world stability and prosperity.

The Chinese ambassador also dismissed claims of “decoupling” or “New Cold War” between China and the United States, saying that they are against the trend of history and unpopular.

“There is no difficulty that cannot be overcome as long as the two sides respect each other’s dignity, sovereignty, and core interests,” he said.

Talking about the phase-one economic and trade agreement that China and the United States have recently inked, Tiankai said the deal, which was aimed at addressing concerns of both sides, showed a spirit of mutual respect and came to fruition through consultation on an equal footing.

Signing the deal “serves the interests of China, the United States, and the world as a whole,” the ambassador stressed.

China and the United States, he suggested, should take it as an opportunity to earnestly implement the strategic consensus reached by their leaders, reduce misunderstandings and miscalculations and properly manage their differences so as to build a relationship based on coordination, cooperation and stability.

The reception was attended by some 700 guests, according to the Washington DC-based Chinese embassy.
