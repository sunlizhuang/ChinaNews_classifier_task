The 201 American evacuees from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus, landed in Riverside, California, and will be put in a three-day quarantine before being allowed back into public.

Video shows the passengers filing off an airplane Wednesday morning and being met by officials in hazmat suits. They have had four screenings for the virus so far, which they passed.

The plane was originally supposed to go to Ontario, California, but was diverted and landed in Riverside. No explanation was given for the change.

"The best possible outcome," Adam Crum, Alaska state health commissioner, said about the screenings so far. "We wish these passengers the best of luck as they complete their journeys home, and I am deeply grateful to everyone who came together to assist us in helping with this repatriation effort."

So far, there have been 6,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and more than 100 deaths.
