Reuters is out with the confirmation from the Chinese Commerce Ministry, as it officially announces on Thursday that the countryâ€™s Vice Premier Liu He will go to Washington to sign Phase One trade deal on January 13th-15th.

Both sides remain in close communication on particular arrangements on signing, the Ministry said.

With the risk-on sentiment extending into Europe, gold prices extend losses below $1550 while USD/JPY holds the higher ground near 109.25 region. The Aussie consolidates its recovery below 0.6880. The trade-positive comments will only add to the upbeat market mood.
