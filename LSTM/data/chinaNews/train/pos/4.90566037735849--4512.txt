On January 6th, H.E. Mr. Huang Qinguo, the Chinese Ambassador to the Bahamas paid a courtesy call on the Prime Minister of the Bahamas Dr. Hubert Minnis.

Ambassador Huang stated that China has always attached great importance to the friendly relations and pragmatic cooperation with the Bahamas. Last year, the high-level exchanges between China and the Bahamas had shown good momentum, Mr. Cai Dafeng, Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress of China, successfully visited the Bahamas. The two sides signed three important cooperation documents such as the Protocol on Quarantine and Health Requirements for Live Lobster to be Imported from the Bahamas into China, the Direct Flight Agreement between China and the Bahamas. Bilateral pragmatic cooperation in economy and trade has developed steadily, and people to people exchanges have continued to deepen.

Prime Minister Dr. Minnis thanked China for its continuous help and support, and for its emergency relief assistance soon after Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas. He said, the Nassau Airport Expressway, the National Stadium, and the Baha Mar Resort which were constructed by Chinese companies had improved the infrastructure in Nassau and promoted the economic development of the Bahamas. He said that the Bahamian Government will continue to adhere to the One-China Principle and deepen bilateral friendly relations and pragmatic cooperation in various fields.

Ambassador Huang and Prime Minister Dr. Minnis also exchanged views on strengthening the Belt and Road cooperation and the post-hurricane-disaster reconstruction cooperation between both sides.
