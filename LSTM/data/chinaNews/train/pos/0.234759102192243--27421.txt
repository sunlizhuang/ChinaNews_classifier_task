On the economic front, weâ€™ll get a look at mortgage approvals by major British banks and the Nationwide House Price Index, both of which are expected to accelerate.

Manufacturing PMI Points to Contraction

The week wrapped up with the release of initial PMIs for January. The manufacturing PMI improved to 49.8, compared to 47.5 in the final December PMI. Still, this points to contraction in the manufacturing sector, which continues to struggle. The services PMI indicated expansion, with a reading of 52.9 points. This was up nicely from the final PMI in December of 50.0 points. As well, this figure beat the forecast of 51.1 points.

The Bank of England will be carefully monitoring these key releases. Bank policymakers have been hinting at a rate cut when they meet to set the benchmark rate Thursday and the weak state of the manufacturing sector remains a concern.
