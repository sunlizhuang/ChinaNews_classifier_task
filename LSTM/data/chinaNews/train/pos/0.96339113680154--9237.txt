The Pixel 3a is a superb device that Express.co.uk certainly recommends if you’re looking for a new phone for less than £400. Google shook up the budget smartphone market with the Pixel 3a – instead of offering Android fans the fastest processors and sacrificing in other areas, the American firm fitted the handset with a lower end Snapdragon chipset but ensured the device still kept the Pixel series’ north star of delivering an incredible photography experience.

The Pixel 3a did so much right that it earned a full five out of five stars in our full review. But before you rush out and buy the Google handset, there’s another budget smartphone you need to know about that could be coming very soon.

Xiaomi is a Chinese manufacturer renowned for its budget smartphone offerings, but back in 2018 it did something different. In August of that year, Xiaomi released the Pocophone F1, a new handset engineered from the ground-up to provide astonishing smartphone value.

The Pocophone F1 comes with a large 1080p display, a dual camera system and what was then Qualcomm’s latest and greatest processor available – the Snapdragon 845. That meant for a mere £329 Android fans could get a device capable of blitzing through apps and multitasking with ease.

Since its debut, Xiaomi fans have been hotly anticipating the Pocophone’s successor and it seems such a device could be on the horizon.
