The closure of Northern Pulp is a massive blow to Nova Scotia’s economy. I believe that we can quickly recover from this blow if we follow the lead of British Columbia.

B.C., arguably the “greenest” province in Canada, is about to build a 650-km pipeline to bring B.C.’s own natural gas to the West Coast for export to China and India. The pipeline has the approval of the 20 First Nations along its proposed route. This project will grow the B.C. economy and help save the environment by enabling China and India to lower their GHG emissions as they switch electricity production from coal to natural gas.

Nova Scotia could do the same. We could harvest our natural gas in Cumberland and Colchester counties and pipeline it to Guysborough and/or Bear Head for export to China, India and Europe. We could also pipeline it to the four coal-fired power plants still operating in Nova Scotia, thereby reducing our CO2 emissions by over three million tons per year, more than the CO2 emitted every year by all the cars and light trucks on Nova Scotia’s roads.

The harvesting of our natural gas, the construction of new pipelines and the building of the LNG exporting facilities would create hundreds, if not thousands, of private-sector jobs in the short term and hundreds of jobs in the long term.

Is there any reason that we should not immediately use our natural gas resources to replace the lost jobs at Northern Pulp, while at the same time moving us toward a cleaner environment and a growing economy?
