BEIJING, January 3(Guangming Online) —The live show “A taste of Beijing” jointly founded by the Information Office of Beijing Municipality and Guangming Online was shot at Beibingyang Yili Park in Beijing, capital of China, Jan. 3, 2020. Quinn, a Chinese journalist from Guangming Online and Bolabola Joelle Zita, an African host from Star Times, co-hosted this show. With the help of the staff there, they got to learn something about Century Yili, a bakery that’s long been famous for its delicious pastries and breads, and Beibingyang soda.

Yili was founded in Shanghai by a Scottish named James Neil in 1906 and moved to Beijing 44 years later. At present, Century Yili has more than 100 chain stores in Beijing, and Beijing Yiqing Group plans to launch a total of 300 Yili chain stores during the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020).

In addition to giving a general introduction to the history of Century Yili, the female worker also showed us the scientific process through which Yili pastries and breads are made, and Bolabola made her own breads with the help of the worker.

The live show “A taste of Beijing” will explore more legendary products of other enterprises titled “China Time-honored Brand” in Beijing. Those who are interested in the show can follow us or “Beijingfabu” on weibo to get the latest information.
