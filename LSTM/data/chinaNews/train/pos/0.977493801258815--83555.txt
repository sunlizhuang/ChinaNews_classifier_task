CAIRO, Feb. 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to Egypt Liao Liqiang has hailed the growing Egyptian "voices of support" for China's fight against the coronavirus epidemic.

Speaking at a press conference in Cairo on Feb. 20, the ambassador said China has attached great importance to international health cooperation since the virus outbreak.

"In accordance with the principle of openness and transparency, China has timely informed all parties of the outbreak, shared the gene sequence of the virus, and worked closely with the World Health Organization (WHO)," he told reporters.

During a press conference in Cairo on Feb. 19, officials of the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean highly appreciated China's efforts to fight the epidemic, Liao added.

Currently, according to the WHO, the number of confirmed cases outside China is less than 1 percent of the total number of confirmed cases. China has effectively prevented the spread of the epidemic worldwide, and made great efforts for global public health security, the ambassador said, adding that "China is not fighting alone."

In a meeting with Liao earlier this month, Egyptian Minister of Health Hala Zayed said that China has adopted timely and effective prevention and control measures since the outbreak of the virus.

China has actively carried out international cooperation in a scientific, rigorous and highly responsible manner, and Egypt highly appreciates this, the minister said.

"Egypt firmly supports the Chinese government and people's efforts to fight the epidemic and firmly believes that China will win the fight," Zayed stressed.

The Egyptian minister also told the Chinese diplomat that a meeting held by the cabinet decided that Cairo gives priority to sending medical supplies to China on the basis of satisfying the domestic demand in Egypt. Enditem
