Huawei unwrapped the Mate 30 Pro back in September and has slowly released the phone across the globe ever since. The standard Mate 30 Pro is now available in Spain, Italy, France and Portugal to name a few, and of course the firm’s home territory of China. But until now, the 5G version of the Mate 30 Pro – that famously climbed to the top of DxOMark’s camera rankings earlier last month – had remained exclusive to China.

That all changed last week though when Huawei debuted the Mate 30 Pro 5G in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). According to Huawei Central, the Shenzhen tech firm made the announcement at a glitzy event in Dubai and was eager to discuss the phone’s blisteringly fast speeds.

Pre-orders for the Mate 30 Pro 5G will start in the UAE on January 15 before a release on January 23. The device will cost 3,899 United Arab Emirates Dirham which translates to roughly £812.

In an attempt to make the jump to a Google-less Android phone more appealing, Huawei is giving away a swathe of free gifts that tally up to 1,829 United Arab Emirates Dirham in value (£381). The free items in store include a SuperCharge wireless car charger, a DJI Osmo Mobile 3 stabiliser and Huawei’s VIP services that include an extended phone warranty.

That’s not all though, it seems the Shenzhen tech company is also gearing up to release the Mate 30 Pro 5G in Malaysia. As noted by Huawei Central, the device recently picked up product certification in the Asian nation.
