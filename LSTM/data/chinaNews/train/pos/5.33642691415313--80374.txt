The world’s most widely drunk spirit is not whisky, gin, vodka or rum. It’s baijiu, the strong white spirit consumed by millions of people every day in China.

Baijiu (pronounced “bye-j’yoh”) has been made in China for more than 500 years. It is distilled from grains – mostly sorghum – that have been fermented with a starter culture of yeast and bacteria called qū (“chew”).

The traditional production process can give the spirit funky, savoury flavours that Western palates find unfamiliar. Because most brands are bottled above 50 per cent alcohol, it has also developed a “firewater” reputation among non-Chinese drinkers.

This perhaps explains why so few distillers outside China have tried to emulate the style – despite what you’d think would be huge sales potential. Now that looks set to change.

In the past year, I have come across two producers of Australian-made baijiu, East Coast and Artemis, selling their products – albeit in very small quantities – both locally and into China.

New start-up producer Good Spirits Co. is due to launch its Australian baijiu in April, and another local company, Blue Harbour Spirits, has a baijiu coming out later in the year.

Young Australian distiller James Mylne is the founder of East Coast Baijiu, in Brisbane. He learnt how to make the spirit working in a distillery in Taiwan. When he discovered the sorghum used there was from Australia, he was inspired to return to Brisbane in 2017 and set up his own brand.

His debut product, the Classic Kaoliang, became the first and only baijiu made outside China or Taiwan to win a medal at the prestigious International Wine & Spirit Competition in England in 2019.
