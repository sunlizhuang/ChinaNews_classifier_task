While a select few major carmakers have announced that they will not be taking part in the 2020 Geneva Motor Show, for startups like Aiways, these events are prime time as they offer them the opportunity steal some of the limelight from established companies and spread the word around.

The Chinese carmaker announced that it will host the world premiere of the U6ion concept at the Swiss event, without revealing anything else about the car at this time.

Joining it on stage will be the European version of the U5. The electric SUV is planned to launch in the Old Continent in the second quarter of the year and is expected to start at around €25,000 ($27,700). This would make it much more affordable than other zero-emission high riders and would place it in the same zone as some small hatchbacks, such as the Renault Zoe, which can be had from €22,000 ($24,400) in Germany.

“Geneva Motor Show is an important milestone for Aiways as we will announce some very exciting news about our plans for Europe”, said executive vice president of overseas operation, Alexander Klose. “We are set to compete with the best, by creating a revolutionary new user experience thanks to unprecedented collaboration with partners.”

The two products will be presented on March 13, at 13:15 (7:15 a.m. EST) during the Aiways press conference in Hall 2, at stand #2121. As always, the CarScoops team will be reporting live from the Swiss event. In the meantime, you can check out our dedicated Geneva Motor Show hub for all the latest news.
