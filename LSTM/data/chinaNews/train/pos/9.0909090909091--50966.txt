The Communist Party of China Central Committee sent a message to the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee on Monday, congratulating it on the 90th anniversary of the CPV's founding.

Over the past 90 years, the CPV has united and led the Vietnamese people to win victory in realizing national unity and liberation and has continued to achieve new accomplishments in socialist construction, it said in the congratulatory message.

"We believe that under the strong leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, the CPV and the Vietnamese people will continue to consolidate and improve the party's leadership and the socialist system, and push forward the cause of 'Doi Moi' (renewal) reforms in a comprehensive and synchronized manner, so as to pave the way for the convocation of the 13th National Congress of the CPV with outstanding achievements," the message said.

The CPC always highly values developing friendly and cooperative relations with the CPV, and stands ready to work with the CPV to strengthen strategic communication, enhance political mutual trust and deepen exchanges of theoretical and practical experience in terms of Party and national governance, it said.

The CPC is willing to learn from and support the CPV in exploring socialist paths with their individual characteristics, and join hands to lead the healthy and stable development of China-Vietnam relations, contributing to the progress of mankind, the message added.
