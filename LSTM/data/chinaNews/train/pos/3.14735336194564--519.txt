Foreign imports

Chilean cherries, Spanish wine, North American lobsterâ€¦ The world's largest market is open and welcoming exotic products from faraway lands during a Spring Festival shopping spree that will boost not only domestic economic growth but also that of the wider world.With the development of e-commerce and cross-border logistics, a more diverse range of products from across the globe are being enjoyed by Chinese consumers during the festival season, also known as the Spring Festival or the Chinese New Year.Ahead of the annual family reunion, Chinese people are accustomed to buying daily necessities, food and drink in local markets with fewer choices."I'm considering buying Spanish wine on online shopping platforms like Tmall for the holidays, which will cost about 200 yuan ($29.2) a bottle," said a Beijing-based white-collar worker surnamed Zhang."It's not expensive but very convenient," Zhang told the Global Times on Sunday.On Thursday, a train from Toshkent, capital of Uzbekistan, arrived in Xi'an, capital of Northwest China's Shaanxi Province, bringing flour, cooking oil, fresh seafood and healthcare products to tickle the holiday shopping fancy of city residents.Other Chinese cities have experienced a rapid growth in imported goods in recent years and as Europe-China train services surge ahead of the festival.In 2019, 42,286 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) containers were shipped by train from Madrid to Yiwu, a major wholesale market in East China's Zhejiang Province, a 68.7 percent year-on-year increase, the operator said in a document sent to the Global Times on Sunday.As the festival season approaches, more trains have been shipping products like Spanish wine and Russian cooking oil from Europe to China, the operator said.In December 2019, 7,978 TEUs were shipped, up 304 percent year-on-year, the document showed.The holiday shopping spree can be interpreted as a test of the country's economic resilience and potential, Chinese experts noted on Sunday.China has vowed to expand imports by lowering tariffs, they noted, making imported products more familiar and accessible to Chinese consumers.China has "vast room for market growth with strengthened growth momentum," Sheng Laiyun, deputy head of the National Bureau of Statistics, was quoted as saying in media reports.With an expanding middle class and per capita GDP hitting $10,000, China's domestic consumption will upgrade, unleashing more potential and driving up demand for imports, the reports said."This year's Spring Festival consumption will be positive, featuring more new consumption trends," Liu Jianying, an associate research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday."Without going abroad, Chinese consumers now can enjoy better access to foreign products, and consumption potential is expected to further unleashed," she said.
