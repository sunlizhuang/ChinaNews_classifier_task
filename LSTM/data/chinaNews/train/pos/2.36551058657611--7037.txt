The Redmi K20 series of phones are some of the best phones Xiaomi makes and despite the Redmi K30 expected to launch in India over the next few months, Xiaomi is upbeat on selling these phones in high numbers. The Redmi K20 Pro is still one of the most affordable phones using the Snapdragon 855 chipset whereas the Redmi K20 is one of the few phones under Rs 20,000 to come with a notch-less display. Xiaomi is now offering some price cuts on these phones to make these sweeter deals than ever.

The Redmi K20 and Redmi K20 Pro are now getting massive price cuts across all digital platforms. Buyers will be able to avail a flat discount of Rs 2,000 but there's a catch to this- buyers will have to make the purchase via an SBI credit card. The offer will also be valid if the customer chooses EMI payment method. Without the SBI offer, the prices of these two phones remain unchanged.

With the offer applied, you can effectively get the Redmi K20 for as low as Rs 17,999. For the price, you are getting 6GB RAM and 64GB storage. The phone comes standard with a Snapdragon 730 chipset powering the phone. It gets a 6.3-inch Full HD+ AMOLED display with an in-display fingerprint sensor. The phone does away with a notch- thanks to the pop-up selfie camera. The Redmi K20 also gets a versatile triple camera setup comprising of a 48-megapixel main camera from Sony.

The Redmi K20 Pro also becomes a greater deal with the new price applied. The base variant of the Redmi K20 Pro with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage can be had for Rs 22,999. This makes it an incredible deal for those looking to buy a flagship-grade phone without spending much money. The K20 Pro is similar to the K20 Pro in many aspects but gets a massive upgrade in terms of performance with the Snapdragon 855 chipset and the Sony IMX586 48-megapixel main camera with 4K video recording at 60fps.

Although Xiaomi hasn't stated any reason behind the offers, it seems that the company wants to clear the stock of the Redmi K20 series phones. The Redmi K30 has already launched in China at prices similar to the Redmi K20 and it's only a matter of time before Xiaomi brings the K30 to India. The Redmi K30 gets an upgraded 120Hz refresh rate display and a quad-camera system.
