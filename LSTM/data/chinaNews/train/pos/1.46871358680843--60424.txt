The United States stands ready to spend up to $100 million to assist China and other countries impacted by coronavirus, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Friday.

"This commitment - along with the hundreds of millions generously donated by the American private sector - demonstrates strong US leadership in response to the outbreak," Pompeo said in a statement.

He said the US government's commitment would be met through existing funds "both directly and through multilateral organisations."
