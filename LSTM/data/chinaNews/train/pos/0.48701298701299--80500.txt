Kindness: “Reasons to Stay Alive,” Matt Haig’s memoir of depression, has been given away by the hundreds by an English bookstore after the suicide of TV figure Caroline Flack. Flack, host of “Love Island,” had praised the book in 2015. After her death, a reader told the Big Green Bookshop that she’d buy a couple copies for people. The effort snowballed — to more than 600 copies — and readers supported it with more than 6,000 pounds, or about $7,750 U.S., so far. Readers have also been giving through another shop, Blackwell’s in Oxford. (The Guardian)
