MIAMI â€” A decade after introducing the Landsail brand to the U.S. market, Sentury Tire USA Inc. is rebranding it as part of its strategy to communicate a clearer message to end-users and trade customers.

Sentury said it will revamp the brand to emphasize the "unique" quality of the tires and concentrate on brand strategy to address customers.

Maxwell Wee, executive vice president of Sentury Tire USA, said the message "communicates the uniqueness" of Landsail tires.

"We hope to leave the impression that tires of this caliber do not come around every day," Mr. Wee said. "It is a simple but bold statement: There are no other tire brands within our tier that have the quality and commitment to staying the course that Landsail has, and we stand behind our brand."

Mr. Wee said that Sentury's brand development research discovered that the Landsail customer is "savvy" and dedicates a lot of time to researching products.

"They don't make a major purchase without doing their homework, and they know how to make an educated purchase that fits their budget," he said. "This knowledge has informed our decision to thoroughly explain the key features and benefits of our Landsail products, specifically on our new website."

The Sentury marketing team has developed a new "look and feel" that enhances the Landsail color palette, Sentury said, which includes new typography, incorporates new social influencer photography communicates a new brand message: Landsail Equipped.

Sentury said that "Landsail Equipped" means that with each Landsail product, customers can expect high quality, research and performance, which leads to a high level of consumer confidence.

As an example of Sentury's commitment to quality, Mr. Wee pointed out that parent Qingdao Sentury Tire Co. Ltd. developed the main landing gear tire for the Boeing 737-700/800/900 aircraft, a process that required the highest and strictest quality standards.
