The Tax Free World Association (TFWA) has opened an office in Shanghai as it seeks to promote its events in Greater China.

The Shanghai base will be led by TFWA’s chief representative in China, Hannah Gao. The office will enable the duty free and travel retail association to “further develop its relations with key stakeholders”.

Gao has more than 10 years of experience in the travel retail industry, and has assisted a number of firms in expanding into the Chinese duty free market.

She is fluent in both English and Chinese, and holds a Master’s degree in integrated marketing communications from Peking University in Beijing, China.

TFWA president Alain Maingreaud said: “It goes without saying that China is a vital market for us at TFWA, as it is for other organisations in the duty free and travel retail business.

“Hannah has excellent contacts among brands, retailers and airports, and she is well placed to help us to foster even closer relationships with our partners and clients in this all-important region.

“This new office will build on the excellent work done until now by Pierre Lequeux and his team at GLI. Pierre and GLI will continue to represent TFWA in Korea and South East Asia and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership.”

The next TFWA Asia Pacific Exhibition & Conference will be held on 10-14 May 2020 in Singapore.

This year’s TFWA World Exhibition & Conference will return to Palais des Festivals in Cannes on 27 September to 2 October.
