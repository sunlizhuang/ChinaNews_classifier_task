A Malaysian man who works for Melco’s City of Dreams Macau has been diagnosed with the Coronavirus in Malaysia.

The 31-year-old patient had visited Zhuhai several times when he was in Macau, the Health Bureau revealed on Tuesday, before returning home to Malaysia on 1 February. He was diagnosed two days later on 3 February.

According to Health Bureau officials, the man showed symptoms after he left Macau, stating, “We believe the chances that he infected other people in Macau is very low.”

According to local media reports, the worker first reported symptoms on 5 February before visiting a doctor four days later and being subsequently referred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital.
