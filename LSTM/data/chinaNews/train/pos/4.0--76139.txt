A 51-year-old domestic worker has won the chance to spend 10,000 euros in 10 hours. María José Guerrero held the lucky ticket in the draw organised by the Torremolinos local traders' association, ACET.

On Thursday she had the task of touring local shops and businesses that belong to the association to spend her winnings. She could buy anything she liked, with a limit of 500 euros in any one establishment, with one item allowed of up to 1,000 euros.

She also had to spread her purchases among the town's four main commercial areas: El Bajondillo, Playamar and Los Álamos; El Calvario; the town centre; La Carihuela, Montemar and El Pinillo.

María José planned her shopping spree ahead to make the most of her ten hours. She said her first stop would be the local travel agency to buy a ticket to Beijing; her son is about to move there to work.

The lucky shopper lives in Malaga city but often goes shopping in Torremolinos where her husband works. She filled in the winning ticket in the restaurant Casa Juan - Los Mellizos during her great-nephew's birthday party.
