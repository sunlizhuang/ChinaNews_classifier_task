Kaley Greenbank is at the helm of Whitsunday Anglican School’s inaugural Chinese language program.

WHITSUNDAY Anglican School will be the first school in the region to offer Chinese language to students as early as Prep all the way through to Year 12.

Kaley Greenbank will be looking after the Chinese language program at the school.

Miss Greenbank, a graduate of the University of Adelaide, arrived in Mackay at the start of the 2020 school year and said she was looking forward to teaching Chinese to students from a young age.

“It allows repetition and early exposure, allowing students to experience success,” she said.

“The lessons will incorporate cultural exposure with an academic focus, as well as some fun activities.”

Whitsunday Anglican School principal Andrew Wheaton said the program was first being introduced to the junior school and would eventually transition to the senior school.

“Students from Prep to Year 6 are taught by a Chinese teacher specialist. This complements the current language offerings of Japanese and French,” he said.

“Our students are loving the opportunity to immerse themselves in the study of Chinese and the benefits of studying a language are significant.

“We know that our students live in an ever-shrinking global world, where they will need to compete on the international stage and the study of languages empowers students to develop international mindedness and appreciation of cultures.”

Miss Greenbank graduated from the University of Adelaide with a Bachelor of Arts and Teaching, majoring in Chinese and French.

She said she was looking forward to experiencing the many activities on offer in the beautiful region.
