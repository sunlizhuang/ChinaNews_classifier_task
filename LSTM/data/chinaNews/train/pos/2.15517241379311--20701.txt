The Michelin-starred chef Josh Emett curated and re-created 300 classic recipes around the world for his new cookbook, "The Recipe."

Speaking with Insider, the New Zealand-based chef shared nine essential dishes that he believed every home cook should know how to make.

The list includes some classic staples like eggs and chicken pot pie.

But it also includes international recipes like Ireland's colcannon dish, China's wonton soup, and England's banoffee pie.

When the Michelin-starred chef Josh Emett began working on his new cookbook, "The Recipe," he first made a list of hundreds of dishes that he considered to be classic.

"They had to be a thing," Emett told Insider. "They had to be something that was completely embedded in people's culture or way of life."

It's safe to say Emett knows a thing or two when it comes to essential recipes, having compiled more than 300 recipes from 150 chefs from around the world for his book, which is why Insider asked the New Zealand-based chef to share the dishes he believed every home cook should learn to make.

While some are beloved staples like eggs and chicken pot pie, there are also dishes from around the world that Emett believes are easy enough for anyone to add to their repertoire.
