Yesterday I mentioned that "in the long run time will only add to the flame of your sense of loss" to the islanders who reluctantly accommodate themselves to the trend of final reunification. But how has the sense of loss been taking form in Taiwan, Hong Kong as well, and then transformed into a mindset of anti-China? Attached below is a little bit long but highly readable article to tell you the reason why, though it is not the one with holistic approach to the the root cause.

PS I remember I have told you a story of mine before in my previous writing. Some time during early 90s, my ancle and my aunt of my mother side came to Taiwan to visit us after we had departed to one another over forty years. At Taoyuan Airport when they returned to Mainland, my elder brother and I chipped in to give them an "hongbao" of $1,000 apiece. I will never forget the mixed expressions were etched on their faces: surprise, appreciation, and pleasure combined. You know, in that time the conversion between USD and RMB was 1:8; that meant we gave each of them RMB8,000, 2,000 shy to the benchmark of a "household of ten thousand Yuan".

Three years ago, when I joined a tour to Henan I met my aunt in Chengzhou again (My uncle had passed away.), I was astonished to find the living condition of her and her families had been very satisfactory, comparing mine in Taipei. Last year in springtime four brothers of us were jointly visiting her again, I found my two cousins were all driving streamlined SUVs. All my goodness, still I am driving a 15-years-old Ford sedan now in Taipei!

Do I inspire in you anything?
