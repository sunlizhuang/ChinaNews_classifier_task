Irie underlines potential as home Olympic star with second gold at FINA Champions Swim Series

Japan's Ryosuke Irie underlined his status as a Japanese hope for home gold at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics by racing to his second title at the International Swimming Federation Champions Swim Series leg in Beijing.

The 29-year-old today captured the men's 200 metres backstroke gold in China's capital, adding to the 100m backstroke title he shared with home swimmer Xi Jaiyu on day one.

Irie clocked 1min 55.55sec at the Ying Dong Swimming Natatorium to make amends for not appearing at the opening Champions Swim Series stop in Shenzhen.

"As the host swimmers, we do have pressure facing the Olympic Games in Tokyo," said Irie.

"But I am excited to compete in the Olympics and will try my best to win both the 100 metre and 200 metre back.

"I know my rivals are very strong but I will try.

"I hope I can swim under 1:54 in the 200m."

Controversial home swimmer Sun Yang also bagged his second title by winning the men's 400m freestyle in 3:44.98.

The three-time Olympic champion is still awaiting the result from a doping case which could cost him his career.

He is facing up to an eight-year ban after one of his entourage smashed his blood vial with a hammer during an attempted drugs test through the night of September 4 to 5 last year.

He denies wrongdoing and blamed a lack of credentials possessed by doping control officers for the row which led to a security guard destroying the vial.

"A comfortable 400m free win for me today," said Sun.

"I try to improve some details in my technique.

"I am happy that I can swim good in the early afternoon.

"The Olympic Games will have morning finals, so we will try to get used to it.

"There are many great swimmers in the world and that is why more and more people are attracted in swimming."
