Not all minorities should get independence, especially ones that are less than 3 generations old -- We have to be practical here. But if they're a large minority, one capable of being an independent state, and a population that has been there for more than a few generations, then I think they are a candidate for independence. Things like this have to be taken on a case by case basis, and we're trying to apply universal rules here; Not a good combination. If there's been a large minority in Ossetia for 300 years, and a majority for 50, then I don't really see why it shouldn't be independent (beyond practicality, if i'm being honest, I don't really know what the region's economy is like) I also don't know what Ossetia's demographics are like, Does it have a massive Georgia minority? If so, then that within itself could cause problems. I guess, at this point, all I'm saying that historical right is a relative, nebulous, and mostly useless term.
