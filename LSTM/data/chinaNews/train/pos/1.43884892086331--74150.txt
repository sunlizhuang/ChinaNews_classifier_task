Emirates SkyCargo is seeing good demand for the import and export of cargo into the Chinese market, despite the extended closure of factories due to the coronavirus.

The air cargo carrier operates freighter services to Guangzhou and Shanghai, having resumed these scheduled services after a planned hiatus over the traditionally low-traffic New Year holidays period.

Many factories are now getting operations back underway while bellyhold cargo capacity is curtailed due to the cancellation of a raft of passenger services.

This will likely result in a spike in demand for those airlines able to offer freighter capacity.

Hiran Perera, Emirates senior vice president, cargo planning and freighters said: “Emirates SkyCargo continues to support trade and movement of goods into the Chinese market and is committed to supporting China’s diverse distribution needs and supply chains through our freighter operations to Shanghai and Guangzhou.

“We are a market-oriented carrier and are ready to fulfil the growing needs of our customers. We will constantly review our operations to ensure that we are able to support the Chinese market by deploying adequate capacity through our freighters. We also continue to carry bellyhold cargo on our double daily flights between Beijing and Dubai,” he added.

The flights to China are operated on Emirates’ Boeing 777 freighter aircraft offering a cargo capacity of around 100 tonnes for exports and imports on each flight.

Commodities being currently transported on the freighter flights include perishable food items, pharma, medical supplies and other general cargo.

Emirates SkyCargo has been continually operating freighter services to Hong Kong and in addition to scheduled services, the carrier also recently operated a charter flight to carry relief materials.
