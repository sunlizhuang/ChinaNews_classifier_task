The New Year has come and gone, but there’s still another massive celebration to be had this January, as Chinese New Year is fast approaching.



To celebrate the Year of the Rat, a massive event by Meraas' Hala China will be featuring a huge list of acts and performances over the course of the month from all over China.



To kick it all off before the New Year, which falls on Saturday January 25, Hala China will have a traditional Lion Dance competition that’s sure to impress, starring pros from China.



Taking place on Saturday January 18 from 2pm until 7pm at Dubai Parks and Resorts, the competition will see more than 30 teams from China compete for the title of the Best Lion Dance 2020, Dubai.



Teams of two performers will become the body of a decorated lion, with the one in front is the head and front limbs, while the one behind is the back and hind legs.



Hala China’s 2019 Chinese New Year celebrations lasted for a whole month, with its grand parade having an attendance of over 22,000 people. However, this year’s is looking to be bigger than ever before.
