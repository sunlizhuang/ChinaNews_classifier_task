PUTRAJAYA: Dong Jiao Zong is not against the teaching of Jawi in schools, says Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Seri Mujahid Yusof Rawa.

"We agreed that the issue of Dong Jiao Zong (the umbrella body comprising educationist groups Dong Zong and Jiao Zong) opposing the teaching of Jawi did not occur," he said after a meeting on Wednesday (Jan 15).

The meeting was attended by Mujahid, Dong Zong chairman Tan Tai Kim and his deputy Datuk Tan Yew Sing as well as Jiao Zong chairman Datuk Ong Chiow Chuen and secretary Tan Cheng Suan.

Representatives from several other Chinese and Tamil non-government organisations also attended the meeting.

Speaking of the meeting, Mujahid said that those who attended also agreed that the teaching of Jawi was not an attempt to bring non-Muslim students under the influence of Islam.

Mujahid said what the groups highlighted in the meeting was the method to implement the teaching of Jawi, which they said needed to be discussed further.

"We share the opinion that we must all stand together against any racist agenda that can potentially destroy national harmony," he said.

Mujahid added it was agreed that Jawi is part of Malaysia's cultural heritage that needs to be respected by all â€“ just like Chinese calligraphy, Tamil and other ethnic writing.

Meanwhile, Tai Kim said that aside from Jawi, the meeting allowed all parties to exchange views on issues relating to race and religion that have emerged of late.

He said Dong Zong expressed that all must work together to find ways to tackle this issue.

"Dong Zong respects differences, we participate in dialogues and discussions to resolve any misunderstandings for the sake of protecting harmony and national unity," said Tai Kim.
