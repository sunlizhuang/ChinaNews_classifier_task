The annual flower markets kick off the Chinese New Year celebrations one week before the first day of the lunar year, filling the parks with colourful and aromatic display of flowers.

The flower markets held at Victoria Park in Causeway Bay and Fa Hui Park in Mong Kok are the best places to soak up the festivities, as you will find stalls selling auspicious flowers and plants, festive rat-themed gifts and souvenirs, traditional snacks and lucky decors. Traditionally, the market would be open for extended hours on New Year’s Eve through to 6am on New Year’s Day.
