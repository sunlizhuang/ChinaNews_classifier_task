UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- UN Security Council and the international community should respect the leadership of the Sudanese government on the Darfur issue, a Chinese envoy said on Tuesday.

The situation in Darfur remains generally stable and is in a critical period of transition, Wu Haitao, China's deputy permanent representative to the UN, said at a Security Council meeting.

China appreciates the efforts made by the Sudanese government to maintain peace and stability in Darfur and promote the political process, he said.

He added the Security Council and the international community should fully recognize the efforts made by the Sudanese government, respect its leadership on the Darfur issue, strengthen communication and coordination, and earnestly listen to its views and suggestions.

The envoy called on the council to review the sanctions against Sudan in a timely manner and set up a roadmap for lifting the measures. The council should send a positive signal to Sudan and provide greater assistance to its government in maintaining regional peace and stability.

The western Sudanese region of Darfur has been plagued by a war between Sudanese government forces and the indigenous population since 2003.
