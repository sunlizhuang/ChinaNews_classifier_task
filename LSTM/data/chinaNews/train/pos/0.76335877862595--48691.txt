Australian exporter Antico International has finished with its Tasmanian cherry export and is now preparing for the plum and table grape exports.

“Most of the cherries were exported in time for the Chinese New Year celebrations,” according to Oliver Wang from the company. “Our cherries, grown on mainland Australia and Tasmania are sent to China and Vietnam and other countries.”

The sales and demand were good according to Mr. Wang and there was little competition from South American cherry imports and none from New Zealand who were late on the market this year.

“We have been pretty lucky and didn’t suffer from the terrible bushfires in Australia.”

Next week the harvest of plums will start in New South Wales. Oliver said that sizes are a little small due to the hot, dry weather.

Most of the wholesale markets in China are very quiet due to the restrictions on movement in China because of the Coronavirus.

“People are also still on holiday as it was extended so we don’t know when people will start shopping again. We are waiting for the customers to come back to us before arranging any exports. There is nothing we can do here until we start to get orders in, so we are pretty much on standby. If no one is shopping there is no point sending fruit and we will have to find different markets in Australia and other Asian countries. Everyone is just really waiting to see what will happen.”
