India is open to greater market access for several American farm and dairy products as it seeks to conclude a trade deal with the US in time for president Trumpâ€™s scheduled visit next week.

New Delhi is willing to allow market access for US-produced cranberries, blueberries, pecan nuts and avocados at lower duties. Also on the cards is allowing some imports of dried distilled grains soluble, a by-product of ethanol production used in animal feed and alfalfa hay, a plant used for fodder, said the people, asking not to be identified citing rules.

Even as talks are on between the two nations to have some sort of a deal on the table ahead of Trump's state visit on Feb. 24-25, there is no clarity yet on when a final agreement will be ready, the people said, adding that work was still underway on the finer details, which aims to resolve long-pending issues on both sides.

Trade talks between Washington and New Delhi have been stalled since before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit in September. A trade deal, even a small one, with New Delhi comprising greater market access for the US is likely to help Trump further consolidate his position in an election year. He's fresh off the success of having signed a 'phase one' agreement with China last month as well as the United States Mexico Canada Agreement or USMCA deal.
