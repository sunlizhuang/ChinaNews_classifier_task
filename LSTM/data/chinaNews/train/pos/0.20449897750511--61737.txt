London: Tory MPs pressuring Boris Johnson over Huawei involvement want all NATO and Five Eyes countries to sign up to an Australian-style Huawei ban.

The British Prime Minister is facing a serious rebellion among his own MPs over his decision to approve Huawei involvement in the 5G rollout, a decision that has angered allies including Australia and the US.

The six MPs, including former cabinet ministers Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis, Damian Green, Owen Paterson and Tobias Ellwood, as well as backbencher Bob Seely, have been dubbed by British media as "The Wolverines" - the same name used by a group of Australian MPs who take a hawkish line on China.

Their intervention follows The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age's revelation that a veteran member of the Australian Parliament's intelligence committee privately confronted British foreign secretary Dominic Raab over the British decision last month to approve Huawei to supply the 5G rollout, against the urging of Australia and the US.
