NEW DELHI: A deal for additional supplies of gas to India and joint formulation to maintain balance in the Indo-Pacific region including steps for capacity building will be among key outcomes from US President Donald Trumps February 24-25 visit.An Agreement will signed for strengthening collaboration among India Oil Cooperation Ltd. Exxon and Chart Industries to improve access to gas, government sources told ET. This agreement will promote access in India to gas in areas where the current gas pipeline infrastructure is not as developed. Till the time that gas pipeline network is developed in the country transportation of gas through container is an efficient alternative.In the US companies like Exxon and Chart Energy have expertise in transporting gas through containers. This agreement will allow us to tap into that expertise and facilities clean and efficient access to gas to areas which are yet not connected to the pipeline infrastructure network.The U.S. has emerged as a key partner for India in the field of energy. India is an important market for U.S. exports,But the sensitive issue that will be keenly watched during President Trump ’s two-day visit to India is the joint formulation of the Indo-Pacific vision, especially since it has the potential to prompt a sharp reaction from China, said people aware of the matter.India will continue to emphasise on an inclusive Indo-Pacific region that includes China, even as the United States has embarked on a strategy to contain China globally, they said.As part of their collaboration, India and the US could launch an Indian Ocean Cooperation and Training exercise, on the lines of the Southeast Asia Cooperation and Training exercise (SEACAT), said one of the persons, who did not wish to be identified.The focus would be on strengthening the capabilities of Indian Ocean states to combat regional issues such as piracy, trafficking and terrorism, said the person.The SEACAT, involving the US, began in 2002 under the name ‘Southeast Asia Cooperation Against Terrorism’ and was renamed in 2012 to expand the scope of training among regional navies and coast guards.Designed to promote multilateral cooperation and information-sharing among navies and coast guards in South and Southeast Asia, the exercise brings together liaison officers to execute maritime responses to scenarios to better tackle maritime security challenges such as smuggling and piracy. It usually comprises a series of workshops, information exercises as well as operations on the sea.“While differences exist on the US and Indian definitions of the Indo-Pacific, the foreign ministerial meeting of the Quad members in New York suggested that on political issues, there was some coordination,” Professor Srikanth Kondapalliof the JNU, a China expert, told ET. “China is now on the alert. As Asia-Pacific benefited from China's rise, Beijing is cautious or even opposing the Indo-Pacific for the possible loss of its position in the new scheme of things.”He said that in an attempt to create a division among the SEACAT members, China is approaching Japan by offering Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects and is likely to make overtures to India as well.“While Wuhan and Chennai meetings brought equilibrium between the two, there have been no tangible benefits to India so far. China tries to pre-empt any coalitions against it by intimidation or offering tactical measures,” said Kondapalli.The second edition of the so-called 2+2 dialogue, between the foreign and defence ministers of India and the US, in Washington in December last year, had created a framework for widening partnership in the Indo-Pacific region.Modi and Trump are expected to focus on building a free, open, inclusive, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific region. They will support ASEAN centrality, rule of law, freedom of navigation and overflight, peaceful resolution of disputes, and sustainable and transparent infrastructure investment, said a person quoted earlier.The two leaders are expected to reaffirm their shared vision for greater connectivity in South Asia and the Indo-Pacific and review the progress of ongoing initiatives being undertaken by India and by the United States for the development of infrastructure and connectivity in the region.Besides, Modi and Trump are likely to emphasise on strengthening diplomatic consultation and coordination between India and the US, bilaterally, with other partners and in regional and international fora to sustain and enrich the international rules-based order.India and the US will explore measures to build on the India-US Oceans Dialogue to advance shared oceanic priorities, including combating pollution, fisheries enforcement, scientific exploration and species documentation in the Indian Ocean, said the people cited earlier.
