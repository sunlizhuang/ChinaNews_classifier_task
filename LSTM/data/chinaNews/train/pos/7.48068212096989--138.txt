TASHKENT, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- Uzbekistan's capital hosted a Chinese art festival among Uzbek students studying Chinese language on the occasion of the 28th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Uzbekistan on Friday.

Chinese Ambassador to Uzbekistan Jiang Yan said in her opening remarks of the festival that over 28 years China-Uzbekistan relations have stood the test of time and have achieved fruitful results in all areas.

"These brilliant achievements would not have been possible without personal attention and stimulation of the leaders of the two countries," Jiang said.

She expressed her appreciation for people who are involved in strengthening bilateral friendship, including those who devote their lives to teaching and learning Chinese language in Uzbekistan.

"Learning Chinese opens a window into a completely different world and helps you become familiar with China," she noted.

Jiang said the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has received "immediate and active support" of Uzbekistan, adding that "promoting the joint building of the BRI will certainly provide you with a broader field for the realization of your dreams."

Gulchekhra Rikhsieva, a rector at the Tashkent State Institute of Oriental Studies, said "today's festival is a great opportunity for young Uzbeks to learn Chinese."
