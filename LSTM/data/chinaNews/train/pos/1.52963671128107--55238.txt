Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus epidemic, the Chinese government has been taking the most comprehensive and rigorous prevention and control measures with a high sense of responsibility for people's health.



Many of these measures go well beyond the requirements of the International Health Regulations.



These control measures are gradually showing their effectiveness. Though the 2019-nCoV has infected a lot of people, its 2.1% mortality rate in China is far below that of infectious diseases like Ebola, SARS and MERS.

The number of recovered cases is also rising. China's efforts have been applauded by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the international community.



We have full confidence and capability to win this fight against the epidemic as soon as possible.

At the same time, acting with openness, transparency and a responsible attitude, the Chinese side informed relevant sides and shared the genome sequence of the coronavirus in a timely manner. WHO and many countries have recognised and commended this.



China has been in close communication and cooperation with WHO. WHO experts recently conducted a field trip to Wuhan. Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also visited China and discussed containment and mitigation of the 2019-nCoV with the Chinese side.



He commends China's efforts and speaks highly of China's great contribution to the world by fighting against the novel coronavirus.



As the WHO Director-General noted, China is setting a new standard for outbreak response. In the same speech, he said specifically that declaring a public health emergency of international concern is not a vote of no confidence in China.



On the contrary, WHO continues to have confidence in China's capacity to control the outbreak.

There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel.



Most countries appreciate and support China's efforts to fight against the novel coronavirus, and we understand and respect them when they adopt or enhance quarantine measures at border entry. But in the meantime, we hope countries will make reasonable, calm and science-based judgments and responses.



The virus is boundless.



In a globalised world, the destinies of all countries are closely linked. In the face of a public health crisis, countries should work together to overcome the difficulties.



China will continue working with WHO and other countries to safeguard regional and global public health security. A friend in need is a friend indeed.



The sympathy, understanding, trust and support of Samoa and other countries also means a lot for Chinese People to overcome the coronavirus epidemic. The merciless virus has brought out great warmth from our fellow human beings. Since the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak, some countries, including Samoa, have expressed understanding and support to China through various means.



As of noon February 2, epidemic prevention and control supplies donated by the ROK, Japan, the UK, France, Turkey, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Hungary, Iran, Belarus, Indonesia and the UNICEF have arrived in China.



In addition, friends in many countries have also offered us support.



We would like to thank them all.
