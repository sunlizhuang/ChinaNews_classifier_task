Champagne discusses coronavirus response, evacuation with China counterpart Jan 31, 2020

OTTAWA — Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne has spoken to his Chinese counterpart about the coronavirus outbreak, a day after the World Health Organization called it a global health emergency.

A statement from Champagne’s office today says he and China’s Wang Yi also discussed the situation of the two Canadians imprisoned in China without access to lawyers or family members for more than a year.

Canada is seeking Chinese approval to send a plane to the Chinese city of Wuhan to collect the 196 Canadians who have asked for help to leave.

Champagne says Wang responded positively to that request.
