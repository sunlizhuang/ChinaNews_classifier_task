We entering the Year of the Rat. The rat is the first animal in the 12-year Chinese zodiac. According to Chinese mythology, the Jade Emperor held a competition to decide the zodiac animals to include in the calendar, saying their placement would be determined by the order in which they reached his palace.

The quick-witted rat asked the ox for a ride across a river to the palace. Upon reaching the shore, the rat jumped down and reached the palace just before the ox, becoming the first of the zodiac animals.
