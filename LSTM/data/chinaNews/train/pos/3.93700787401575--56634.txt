BEIJING, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- China released policies and measures Thursday to encourage workers to participate in vocational skills training online to strengthen the containment of the novel coronavirus.

Key online courses will be free for workers while the scope of free courses will be expanded for the areas hit hard by the virus, according to a circular issued by the National Development and Reform Commission.

The circular also encouraged enterprises to implement online recruitment in cooperation with the online vocational skills training platforms.

Workers will also be given the priority to participate in on-site training after the epidemic outbreak based on the hours and credits they accumulate through online training, said the circular.
