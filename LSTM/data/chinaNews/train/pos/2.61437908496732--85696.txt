AUCKLAND, New Zealand, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Consulate General in Auckland Ruan Ping joined Auckland girls in singing for Wuhan on Monday.

The song, titled "Together with You" is aimed to lift the spirits of those in Wuhan and the rest of China in the fight against the novel coronavirus, sending a message of love and hope, and solidarity between the people of Auckland and Wuhan.

Appreciating the girls' performance of the song in central Auckland on Monday, Ruan joined in the choir and sang together with the girls.

Founder of the Auckland Girls' Choir, Leonie Lawson has just celebrated her 89th birthday. She wrote the music and lyrics as a message of hope and encouragement, a song for the people of Wuhan from the city of Auckland, New Zealand.

"I know the Chinese people have very good fighting spirit when they face something difficult. So the song I wrote is a very forward, uplifting and positive piece. Saying we must stand up and fight this together, we are with you Wuhan," said Lawson when introducing the song.

It took Lawson three days to write the song and the girls gave up afterschool activities to practice it.

"I was touched by both the girls' spirit and the beautiful song. This song is a call across the South Pacific from New Zealand. It encourages the Chinese people and shows New Zealand people's support for us", said Ruan.

"Our Chinese people are resilient and determined to defeat the Coronavirus. The song performed by Ms. Lawson and the Auckland Girls' Choir echoes Chinese people's endeavor," he added.

A banner full of best wishes written by the girls and local community members was also presented to Ruan on Monday. "Wuhan stay strong, together with you", reads one line in the banner.
