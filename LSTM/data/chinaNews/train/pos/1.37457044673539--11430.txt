Oppo has had an impressive year in 2019, coming up with some of the best looking phones across all price ranges. The company seems to continue on that trend in 2020 with the recently launched F15. The F15 is part of Oppo's F series of smartphones that focuses primarily on the front camera performance as well as design. This year's model is a successor to the quite popular F11 from last year and so far, there's no Pro version coming out yet.

Unlike the previous year's models, Oppo has decided to go ahead with only a single variant of the phone at one price. Yes, the F15 only comes with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage as standard, with Oppo not revealing any plans to come up with other variants soon. This is also the reason Oppo has put a rather premium price tag on the F15- it can be yours at Rs 19,990. That puts the F15 against some of our favourite phones from this segment, including the Realme X2, Redmi Note 8 Pro and Samsung Galaxy A50S.

Hence, if you are willing to buy the Oppo F15, here are a couple of things you should know about it.

Oppo F15 specifications

Chipset: The F15 relies on a MediaTek Helio P70 chipset.

RAM & Storage: Oppo will sell the F15 only with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage for now.

Front Camera: The F15 relies on a 16-megapixel camera for taking selfies.

Oppo F15 features

-Although Oppo may not agree, the F15 is spec-by-spec identical to the Oppo A91 launched in China a few months ago. It carries the same chipset, cameras, design and even the pricing. It even comes in the same colours as the A91, except for the red gradient shade.

-The F15 is the first F series phone to ditch the micro USB port in favour of a USB-C port. It also gets rid of the LCD display and goes all up for a 6.4-inch AMOLED display with an in-display fingerprint sensor.

-The Oppo F15 gets an upgrade to a quad-camera setup at the back. The primary camera still uses a 48-megapixel camera that's paired with an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 2-megapixel macro camera and a 2-megapixel depth camera. This camera setup is quite similar to the ones found on the Realme 5S and Realme 5 Pro.

-Despite some modern upgrades, the Oppo F15 still uses the older MediaTek Helio P70 chipset. This is chipset is quite underpowered on paper when compared to the chipsets that phones at this price range offer. The Realme X2 has a more powerful Snapdragon 730G chip while the Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro offers an even more capable MediaTek Helio G90T chipset.
