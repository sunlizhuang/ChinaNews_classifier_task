Sam Roth spoke with CBS 58 moments after he learned his family safely landed in the United States.

“I’m quite relieved,” Roth said. “They’re doing well. She [his wife] said the flight was more comfortable than she expected and I guess there was a good deal of chips and chocolate on the plane and my daughter gorged herself.”

Roth sent CBS 58 the following photos his wife took throughout the evacuation process.











Roth said his wife and two daughters were self-quarantined in his in-law’s apartment in Wuhan following the coronavirus outbreak.

Roth plans on traveling to Travis Air Force Base to see his family as soon as possible. His wife and children are expected to be in quarantine for 14 days.
