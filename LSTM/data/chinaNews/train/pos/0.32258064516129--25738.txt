Just recently, both the Xiaomi Redmi 8 and Redmi 8A received a new January security update, but the devices didnâ€™t get the latest Android 10 OS. The update was based on the older Android 9 Pie OS. Now, the Redmi 8A has made an appearance on GeekBench with the latest Android 10 OS. The listing suggests that the device will soon get the Android 10 update.

While a lot of Redmi or Mi users have been eagerly waiting for the Android 10 update, it seems that Xiaomi is gradually releasing the update for its phones. A few weeks back, the smartphone maker rolled out Android 10 update for Mi A2, which is the second Android One device from the Chinese company. Just recently, Xiaomi confirmed that it will roll out the Android 10 update for Mi A3 in February 2020. The confirmation came in the form of a reply to a user query.
