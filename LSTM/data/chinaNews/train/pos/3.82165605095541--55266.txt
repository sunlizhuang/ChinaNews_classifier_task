S. Mahinda Thera lived until his death at Sri Sudharmaramaya and the temple is said to hold the remains of the prelate and home to many of his belongings which are treasured in a museum.

One of the most active members of the Sri Lankan independence movement. The effort made by S. Mahinda Thera to give Lankans their freedom song was immense.
