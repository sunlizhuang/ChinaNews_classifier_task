Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will travel to Washington, D.C., next week to sign the first phase of trade talks between China and the United States.

Liu, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s top Chinese trade negotiator, will be in the U.S. between Jan. 13 and 15, China announced on Thursday.

President Trump has indicated he is willing to go to Beijing to negotiate a trade deal and has said he is confident the two countries will find a way to put the three-year trade war to an end. The Trump administration last year slapped China with 25% tariffs.

"Had a very good talk with President Xi of China concerning our giant Trade Deal. China has already started large scale purchases of agricultural product & more," Trump said late last year. "Formal signing being arranged. Also talked about North Korea, where we are working with China, & Hong Kong (progress!)."

Under the deal, the president agreed to suspend plans for new tariffs on Chinese imports and to reduce some of the existing tariffs. In exchange, China agreed to increase agricultural purchases. The details of the plan, however, have not been released to the public.
