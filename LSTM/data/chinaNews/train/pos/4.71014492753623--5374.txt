KUALA LUMPUR:In conjunction with Chinese New Year celebration, Suria KLCC shopping mall has lined up an array of activities featuring century-old Chinese traditions with a modern twist.

Its chairman Datuk Hashim Wahir said the celebration this year was in line with the ‘Visit Malaysia 2020’ tourism campaign to promote the uniqueness of Malaysia’s cultural diversity.

‘The rat year is significant as it is the first sign from the 12 animals’ cycle of the Chinese Astrology and 2020 is a year of new inception and renewals.’

Hashim said the grand decorations at the centre court of the shopping mall will depict the ancient Chinese pagoda.

‘One of our main attractions at the mall is Malaysia’s tallest pagoda structure, which has been recognised in the Malaysia Book of Records 2020.

‘At 70ft tall and decorated with Chinese lanterns and peonies, shoppers will be bedazzled by its height and beauty,’ he said at the ‘Great Lunar New Year’ launching ceremony at Suria KLCC here.

Present was Tourism Malaysia director-general Datuk Musa Yusof. He said Suria KLCC had pledged to donate to the Children’s Wish Society of Malaysia to raise public awareness of the plight of less fortunate children.

‘The donation is a continuation of efforts by Suria KLCC. Last year, we collected about RM20,000 during the Christmas campaign.

‘This year, we will be donating RM40,000 to the same society,’ he added.

At the launching ceremony, shoppers and visitors were presented with a lion dance performance, a 24-drum launch gambit and they also took part in the tossing of ‘Lou Sang’.

The Chinese New Year celebration, which started on Thursday, will end on Feb 2.
