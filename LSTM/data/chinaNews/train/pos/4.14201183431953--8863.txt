(Reuters) - Australian Vanadium Ltd (AVL) (AVL.AX) said on Wednesday it penned a non-binding agreement with a unit of steelmaker HBIS Group Chengsteel that could see the Chinese firm buy vanadium and invest in the Perth-based firmâ€™s flagship project.

AVL signed a letter of intent with Hebei Yanshan Vanadium and Titanium Industry Technology Research Co Ltd that will allow both companies to negotiate a binding agreement for the sale of vanadium products.
