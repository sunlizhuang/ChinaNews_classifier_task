Patrick Stewart enthusiastically gets dirty at his Hollywood hand and footprint ceremony Stewart's prints were cemented at the TCL Chinese Theatre IMAX in Hollywood.

On Monday, Sir Patrick Stewart boldly went where Hollywood's elite have gone before, to the TCL Chinese Theatre IMAX in Hollywood, California, for his very own hand and footprint ceremony.

The "Star Trek" actor happily revealed his latest accomplishment with a one-word Twitter update: "Cemented."

He also enclosed a photo of his freshly placed hand, footprints and elegant signature in the still-wet cement.

ABC News caught up with Stewart at the event, where he emotionally told reporters, "It is an extraordinary, exciting honor to be here," before mischievously joking, "even though it does require me to get my hands and feet a little dirty."

The 79-year-old, who was wearing a striking cranberry jacket, was all smiles as he pressed his hands into the cement and even obliged reporters when they begged him to "show us your hands" after his print was cast.

The actor decided to not dirty up a good pair of dress shoes for the event and opted instead to wear a simple pair of gray sneakers. Video shows Stewart grinning broadly and shrugging a bit while he stood on the cement and waited for the mold to set in.

The ceremony kicks off the official countdown to Stewart's highly anticipated new series, "Star Trek: Picard," which premieres on the streaming service CBS All Access on Jan. 23. The latest series serves as a continuation of "Star Trek: The Next Generation," which ran from 1987 to 1994 but picks up after the tragic events from the 2002 movie "Star Trek: Nemesis."
