MUNICH, Germany, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- China's State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said here on Friday that China appreciates Germany's objective and calm attitude toward the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic.

Wang made the remarks during his meeting with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on the sidelines of the 56th Munich Security Conference (MSC).

During their talks, Steinmeier asked Wang to convey his best wishes to Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Steinmeier said that on behalf of the German people, he would like to convey sincere solicitude at the critical moment when the Chinese people are fighting against the epidemic.

The German people admired China's strength, rapidness and effectiveness to contain the epidemic and are willing to offer support and help, he said, wishing all the patients quick recovery.

Noting that the newly confirmed cases of the virus outside China's Hubei Province is in constant decline, Steinmeier said the trend is crucial and comforting.

He said people should not let panic infect them like virus, adding Germany will stay calm and sensible and continue to carry out normal exchanges and cooperation.

For his part, Wang conveyed Xi's cordial greetings to Steinmeier.

Wang said under Xi's leadership the Chinese people stay united and are going all out to combat the epidemic.

Positive progress has been made in prevention and control and the spread of the epidemic to other countries has been effectively prevented, Wang said.

Wang noted that China is highly responsible for maintaining global public health security, to which China has made contributions as well as sacrifices.

Wang said he was invited to attend the MSC to brief the international community on the achievements of the Chinese people in the fight against the epidemic.

China is not only capable of overcoming the epidemic, but also has confidence to minimize the impact of the epidemic and achieve the development goal set for this year, Wang said.

Wang said China appreciates Germany's support and help, as well as its objective and calm attitude, saying panic is more fearful than the virus.

Wang also noted that nowadays the world is full of risks and challenges, saying it is necessary for China and Germany, as responsible major countries, to strengthen strategic cooperation and jointly safeguard world peace and stability.

With a series of important political agendas between China and the European Union (EU) this year, China is willing to strengthen coordination with Germany and work with all parties to ensure the success of these events and lift the China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership to a new level.

Steinmeier said that Germany attaches great importance to Sino-German ties and is willing to maintain close high-level exchanges with China, enhance bilateral and multilateral cooperation, promote the development of China-EU relations and jointly safeguard multilateralism, free trade and international order.
