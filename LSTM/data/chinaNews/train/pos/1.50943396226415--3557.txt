MEXICO: The state of Nuevo León has awarded CRRC Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Co a contract to supply 26 articulated light metro trainsets to Monterrey.

The contract was finalised in December and deliveries are scheduled for 2021. The trainsets will be used on Metrorrey lines 1 and 2 as well as on the future Line 3 which is scheduled to open in February 2021. There are options for a further five units.

CRRC said the 80 km/h trainsets would meet European standards for body strength and crashworthiness, and will have its own design of articulation able to accommodate curves down to 25 m radius. There will be a dedicated a wheelchair area on board.

Environmental measures will include the use of low-energy LED lighting, low-noise wheelsets and air-conditioning systems which automatically adjust to match the number of passengers. Up to four vehicles will be able to operate in multiple, enabling train lengths to be varied to suit demand.

Bids to finance the order were submitted by eight financial institutions, with three shortlisted. Banorte and Banobras have been selected to provide 20-year loans of 1·4bn pesos and 0·92bn pesos respectively.

Last year Metrorrey bought 24 Düwag U3 LRVs from Frankfurt operator VGF, which will be refurbished by Talbot Services, Prose and Schaltbau Refurbishment under a €40m contract for delivery by September 2021.

State Governor Jaime Rodríguez Calderón said the expansion of the fleet through the acquisition of the German and Chinese cars would encourage people to use the metro rather than cars, helping to reduce pollution.
