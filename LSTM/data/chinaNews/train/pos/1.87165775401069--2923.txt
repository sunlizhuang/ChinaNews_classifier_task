As costs bite, Citic sells chunk of its McDonald's stake

Citic Ltd, the mainboard-listed arm of Chinese state-backed conglomerate Citic Group, is planning to sell a 22 percent stake in McDonald's mainland and Hong Kong operations, more than two years after it bought into the fast-food chain.

Rising costs are pinching the franchise's profits, it said.

The sale will bring Citic Ltd's share in McDonald's China down to 10 percent.

The bottom price for the stake is set at 2.17 billion yuan (HK$2.43 billion) and the bidding process is ongoing, said a disclosure document filed by Citic Ltd to the Beijing Equity Exchange.

Separately, Citic Capital, the group's flagship alternative investment arm that manages over US$26 billion (HK$202.8 billion) in assets, said it is "actively participating in the bidding process."

It currently owns 20 percent in McDonald's China.

McDonald's sold an 80 percent stake in its China and Hong Kong operations to a group of investors led by Citic for about US$1.7 billion (HK$13.26 billion) in 2017.

Citic Ltd and Citic Capital jointly hold a 52 percent stake, while US private-equity firm Carlyle owns 28 percent. McDonald's controls a 20 percent stake in the China business.

In late 2017, the Chicago-based fast-food giant changed its registered business name to "Golden Arches (China)" in the mainland and planned to nearly double the number of its outlets in the country to 4,500 by 2022.

Citic Ltd said the transaction was "purely a business decision."

Citic and its partners have added more than 1,000 new restaurants in the mainland and Hong Kong since they took over and will continue to benefit from the development of McDonald's China, it said.

McDonald's said the transaction would not affect its business strategy and daily operations in the mainland and Hong Kong.

The stake sale comes as the fast-food chain saw revenue and profit growth stall amid fierce competition in China's dining scene.

Citic's disclosure document showed that revenue for the McDonald's China master franchiser, called Fast Food Holdings, was HK$24.8 billion in 2018.

For the first 11 months of last year, it was HK$24.4 billion. Net profit for the first 11 months last year was HK$856.2 million, while net profit for 2018 reached HK$1.15 billion.

Shares of Citic Ltd fell 1.31 percent to HK$9.82 yesterday.
