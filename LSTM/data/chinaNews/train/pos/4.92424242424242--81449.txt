In the runup to St. Patrick's Day next month, Dunkin' is putting a decidedly green cast on its beverage offerings with the introduction of matcha lattes, beginning next Wednesday, Feb. 26, at the brand's outlets nationally, a news release said.

The green tea powder concoction is blended with what Dunkin' said is the consumer's "milk of choice," in a hot, iced or frozen drink. And to go along with that, the brand is also debuting a protein muffin with blueberries, cranberries, sunflower seeds and pepitas or pumpkin seeds.

Matcha tends to be a bit sweeter than traditionally steeped or brewed green tea since it is made by grinding young green tea leaf buds into a powder to make the bright green beverage. Dunkin' said the drink was very successful in initial runs in Springfield, Massachusetts and Phoenix, so it opted to spread the green nationwide.

"Whether you're an avid matcha latte drinker or are trying it for the first time, guests can expect an authentic, quality experience with Dunkin's matcha lattes," Paul Racicot, Dunkin's global culinary innovation director, said in the release. "We're excited to offer millions of Americans a delicious new way to run on Dunkin' that perfectly matches the iconic brightness and energy that they know and love from our brand."

The Canton, Massachusetts-based brand has more than 13,000 restaurants in 41 countries worldwide.
