The upbeat sentiments were â€œdriven primarily by a more positive assessment of the current job market and increased optimism about future job prospects," Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said in a statement. "Optimism about the labor market should continue to support confidence in the short-term and, as a result, consumers will continue driving growth and prevent the economy from slowing in early 2020."

The percentage of respondents who said jobs were "plentiful" jumped to 49 percent from 46.5 percent while those who said jobs were "hard to get" fell to 11.6 percent from 13 percent.

Meanwhile, those who reported business conditions were "good" rose to 40.8 percent from 39 percent while those who said they were "bad" fell to 10.4 percent from 11 percent.

President Trump took note of the improved confidence.
