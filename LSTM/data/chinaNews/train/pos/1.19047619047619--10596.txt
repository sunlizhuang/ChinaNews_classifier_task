Chinese varsity team urges KU students to apply for exchange programme

An eight-member delegation of the Sichuan Normal University (SNU) of China and the Confucius Institute of Karachi University (CIUK) visited the Karachi University Business School (KUBS) on Wednesday.

The delegation had a discussion with KUBS students and faculty about an exchange programme. According to a press release, the delegation expressed that the SNU was committed to provide scholarships to 20 students of the varsity every year.

The SNU officials expressed that they would like to extend collaboration in other fields, including faculty exchange programs, supervising MPhil/PhD students of the Karachi University, becoming a part of the varsityâ€™s research journals of various departments, online video conferences and webinars.

The visitors expressed interest in becoming a part of the KUBS upcoming journal, while the SNU officials said they would soon nominate one of their faculty members as the international advisory board member for the KUBS journal.

KU acting VC Professor Dr Khalid Iraqi suggested that the departments should select the potential students in the second year so they could learn Chinese at the CIUK in the third year.

He said the selected students should be sent to the SNU to complete their fourth year of studies. This way, he added, students would have a good command over the language. The Chinese delegation also interacted with students and faculty members, and encouraged them to study in the SNU to get higher degrees.
