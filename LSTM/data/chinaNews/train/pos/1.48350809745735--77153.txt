2020 Chevrolet Captiva in Thailand is now priced at just over PhP 800,000 Kelvin Christian Go February 19, 2020 11:27

With General Motors officially closing down operations in Thailand (not to mention selling off the Rayong plant to Great Wall), Chevrolet Thailand has about 10 months before ceasing vehicle sales in South East Asia.

What do you do when you still have plenty of cars in inventory and you're about to close shop? Have a fire sale.

Recently, the automaker announced that it is having a clearance sale of the 2020 Captiva. From its original price of THB 999,000 (about PhP 1.622 million), the company slashed THB 500,000 off its sticker price. This means the 2020 Captiva is now only selling for THB 499,000 (about PhP 810,351) until stock runs out.

But what about the rest of Chevrolet's lineup? The bow-tie brand has yet to announce whether their other models in Thailand will also get a massive discount. But given the fact that they just removed THB 500,000 off the Captiva's original price, we won't be surprised if the other nameplates will get a huge discount as well in the future.

Meant to be a last-ditch effort to prime sales, the Wuling Almaz-based Captiva was first launched in Thailand during the 2019 Bangkok International Motor Show. No longer a GM-Daewoo product, the new Chinese-based compact crossover goes up against the likes of the Mazda CX-5, Honda CR-V, Subaru Forester, and the Toyota RAV4.

The Captiva is powered by a 1.5-liter turbocharged engine that generates 150 PS along with 230 Nm of torque. It is then mated to a six-speed dual-clutch transmission that drives the front wheels.

The all-new Captiva was supposedly planned to be offered in the Philippines. But with Chevrolet shuttering operations in South East Asia, that might no longer be the case. However, The Covenant Car Company Inc (TCCCI), the official distributor of Chevrolet in the Philippines, could source some of their from China instead.
