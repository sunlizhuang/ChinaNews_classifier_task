BANGKOK (Feb 6): ASEAN member countries should share information and strengthen cooperation to stop the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in the region, Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan o-cha said today.

Prayuth who had a telephone conversation with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, said he agreed with the latter that information exchange and close cooperation through existing channels between ASEAN member countries were essential to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

“Thailand is ready to assist and support Indonesia and other ASEAN members in any way we can,” he wrote in his official Twitter account today.

Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said Thailand is ready to share its experience in treating severe cases of coronavirus.

“We never conceal information. We believe sharing information will lead to effectiveness to control outbreak and improve treatment,” he said at a daily briefing here today.

Earlier this week, two doctors from Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok said they discovered a new approach — a combination of medications for flu and HIV led to improvement 48 hours after treatment. They said the treatment improved the condition of several patients under their care.

As of today, Thailand has confirmed 25 coronavirus cases where nine had been cured and discharged from hospitals.

On calls to ban Chinese tourists to the kingdom, Anutin said infection prevention and control measures are more effective than a travel ban which it does not reduce the number of cases.

“However, I must reiterate that the people’s lives and health are our top priorities,” he said.

Anutin said the Chinese government has expressed its gratitude to the Thai government for taking good care and treated its citizens diagnosed with coronavirus in the kingdom.
