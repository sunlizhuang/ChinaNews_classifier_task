Publications Portfolio

Designed for the busy foreign investor, Asia Briefing publications are regularly noted for their accessibility, easy to read, and straight to the point writing style. Working in conjunction with parent company Dezan Shira & Associates - a specialty foreign investment firm with offices in China, HongKong , India, Vietnam and Singapore - Asia Briefing is one of the few publishers in Asia with the ability to provide on-the-ground insights across the Asian business world.

In addition to China Briefing, our flagship magazine with the latest technical business insights to foreign corporations doing business in China, the Asia Briefing brand also includes India, Vietnam, Russia and Mongolia Briefing magazines. Our technical and regional guides expand beyond magazine content to present a more detailed and comprehensive picture of business in the region.

Asia Briefing's current magazine selection is the result of over a decade of growth, beginning with the first issues of China Briefing in 1999. Today, we publish China Briefing magazines on a monthly basis, India Briefing and Vietnam Briefing on a quarterly basis, Russia Briefing biannually and Mongolia Briefing and 2point6billion.com as special publications.
