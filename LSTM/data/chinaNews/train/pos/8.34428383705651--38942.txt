At 91, Marie Woo has succeeded at pretty much everything an artist can do — except for walking away from her work.

"I'm trying to retire, but I'm having a show in October," says the icon of the ceramics community, laughing at her own predicament. "It doesn't end. It keeps going."

So does the acclaim for a woman who's earned a reputation as "the potter's potter" and as an educator, researcher and curator who's played a major role in spreading awareness of Chinese folk pottery.

Woo was announced Thursday as the 2020 Kresge Eminent Artist, a lifetime achievement award given annually to a metro Detroiter for distinguished contributions to the arts and the community.

The honor comes with a $50,000 prize.

Known both for her mastery of clay and her continuing commitment to experimentation and innovation, she joins 11 other past winners. It's a collection of Detroit luminaries that includes the late jazz trumpeter Marcus Belgrave, photographer and activist Leni Sinclair, painter and sculptor Charles McGee, and the late Michigan Opera Theatre's artistic director David DiChiera.

“Marie Woo has been a transformational force in the development and elevation of her art form, and in the enrichment of our cultural community – the bases for the Kresge Eminent Artist Award,” said Rip Rapson, the president and CEO of The Kresge Foundation, in a statement.

The honor is part of the Kresge Arts in Detroit program funded by the Kresge Foundation and administered by the College for Creative Studies. Kresge Arts in Detroit also has the Kresge Artist Fellowship and Gilda Award programs, which provide prizes of $25,000 and $5,000, respectively.

Woo becomes the first Kresge Eminent Artist to represent the art of ceramics.

"She is revered. Fundamentally, it's her work, the way she can take this inert clay and make something that's got energy and life and draws you to it," says James Adair, president of the Michigan Ceramic Arts Association, which gave Woo its lifetime artist achievement award in 2019.

Adair, who first learned about Woo's work as a college student, says she is recognized globally for her creations. But her spirit of continuing exploration and her generosity toward other ceramicists also defines who she is.

"The continuing theme is her personality and her gifts, her heart, her intelligence .... It's made her an icon. She's an elder stateswoman in the ceramics community here and she's internationally known."

Woo's vessels and sculptural wall pieces are part of the permanent collections of the Detroit Institute of Arts and museums in Japan, Greece, Latvia, Switzerland, China and more.

"Woo’s creations are noted by critics for intentionally and jarringly obliterating the line between form and function, often achieved by exposing clay to natural elements such as rain, snow and twigs," noted the announcement of her award. "Ceramicists strive to replicate 'Woo Yellow' and 'Woo Blue' – two of the most famous signature glazes that Woo has developed throughout her career."

Woo is being recognized at a time when the overall art world is addressing the systemic marginalization of women artists, who've consistently been under-represented in museums and art history studies.

The Baltimore Museum of Art is devoting 2020 to a commitment that every artwork it buys this year for its permanent collection will be one created by a woman.

In recent years, Wikipedia edit-a-thons (like the ones hosted in 2017 by the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit and the University of Michigan) have been held to increase representation of women artists in the online information source.

Woo doesn't have a Wikipedia page yet. But for her, art hasn't been about building a public profile. It's about the work.

"I never thought about it as a whole career," she said during a phone interview with the Free Press. "I just did it as I went along, and it turned out OK. I always had my hands in clay."

Massachusetts artist Mary Barringer, a former editor of the Studio Potter journal, describes Woo as an early role model for women in the ceramics community.

"Marie was also one of very few women visible and respected in the field when I was a young maker. That was an accomplishment hard to appreciate nowadays, when there are so many more opportunities for women," says Barringer. "She was, for me, an early example of grit and ambition, as well as supreme mastery of her medium."

Woo was born in Seattle in 1928 to parents who had immigrated to America from southern China. Spurred toward art by a grade school teacher, she majored in the subject at the University of Washington and went on to earn a master of fine arts degree from Cranbrook Academy of Art.

At Cranbrook, she studied under notable Finnish ceramicist Maija Grotell, who launched the school's ceramics program and was known as the “mother of American ceramics.’’

Since that era, clay has been her chosen material. "Clay is very challenging and inspiring and so, an artist works through ideas, and my medium is clay. Since Cranbrook, it's been clay all these years."

Although Woo says it's hard to verbalize why, she does so perfectly."It's part of earth and it becomes part of my meaning," she says.

While at Cranbrook, Woo also met her future husband, architect Harvey Levine. The couple, who live in West Bloomfield, married in 1959 and spent much of the 1960s traveling in southeast Asia, where Woo studied ancient clay techniques in Japan.

They returned to the United States in 1967 after the birth in Thailand of their son, Ian, who lives nearby in Birmingham and is a corporate pilot. They settled a year later in the Detroit region. They also have a daughter, Leslie Raymond, who is the director of the Ann Arbor Film Festival, a leading event of independent experimental cinema.

Raymond says her mother has always been modest about her accomplishments, even as she was being an inspiring example of combining work with family and staying vitally engaged at all phases of life.

Woo focused on being a studio potter and teaching as her children grew up. When they became old enough to leave the house and start their paths, she resumed traveling "without missing a beat," says Raymond.

Through a 1998 grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, Woo started researching and documenting the vanishing pottery traditions of China — the everyday objects grounded in centuries of folk art.

"In the West, we know so little about the folk pottery," says Woo. "In museums and in what's published, it's all the imperial court ceramics that we are familiar with," a reference to the elaborate porcelain works of the privileged classes.

Woo's decade-long quest resulted in "Chinese Folk Pottery: The Art of the Everyday" that opened in 2013 at the University of Michigan Museum of Art with a symposium and documentary film screenings. It went on to travel the country through 2019.

Although Woo says her goal is retiring, her upcoming fall 2020 show at Detroit’s Scarab Club Art Gallery is a prime example of how her fans and colleagues aren't ready for her to take it easy.

MaryAnn Wilkinson, executive director of the Scarab Club and one of six panelists who made this year’s Eminent Artist selection, said in a Kresge statement, “Her elegant and subtle ceramics question the traditional functional nature of pottery through her own constantly evolving artistic language. Not content to simply work in the studio, she has helped to preserve Asian folk traditions in ceramics that were in danger of dying out."

In addition to the $50,000 prize, Woo's award comes with the making of a short film about her (which will screen at an April event) and a monograph on her work.

Woo is still adjusting to the news of her eminence. "I was overwhelmed. I'm very surprised. It's a big honor. I'm trying to get over it," she says.

And don't count on that retirement just yet. "I just work continually. Ideas are formed and there's a lot of experimenting. I would pursue the ideas and it works and sometimes it doesn't work. It's a challenging continual search, actually."

Says Woo, "Work just keeps you going."
