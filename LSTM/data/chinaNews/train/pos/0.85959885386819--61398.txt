Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for Migrant Workers’ Affairs Sarah Arriola assured the public that their team is prepared in the repatriation of Filipinos in Wuhan.

“The DFA team is already experienced in repatriation operations, and has been briefed and prepared for this particular assignment. They will also undergo simulation exercise at Clark International Airport a day before the flight to ensure fast and efficient operation,” read the statement.

A send-off ceremony for the DFA team will be held at Mabuhay Lounge at the Philippine Air Force Base (Clark Air Base) this Saturday at 9 p.m.

The repatriated Filipinos are expected to arrive in Clark on Sunday (Feb. 9).

The team who assisted in the repatriation will also be placed under quarantine.
