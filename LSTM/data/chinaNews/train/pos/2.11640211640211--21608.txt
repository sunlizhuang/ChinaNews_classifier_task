PCJCCI organises session

LAHORE: There was a vast scope of joint ventures between Pakistan and China in the field of floriculture, an official said on Thursday.

Addressing a think-tank session at the Pakistan China Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry, PCJCCI President Zarak Khan said that in recent years, flower production had increased in Kasur, Sheikhupura, Chunian, Okara, Faisalabad, Sahiwal and Gujranwala and over 100 varieties of flowers were being produced in these cities.

The most prominent are carnations, jasmine, tulips, poppies and roses in dozens of colors. He observed that an investor in the floriculture sector of Pakistan could get maximum profit by making the product value-added for supplies to hotels as flower baskets, bouquets and bunches for direct export.

Northern aAreas have very rich flora and germ plasm, which still are not properly being utilised for export business, he said, and pointed out that value-added products such as essential oil of rose, tube rose, jasmine, etc, and plant extracts used in medicines and pharmaceutical industry should also be explored to win the export markets of China and other countries of the world.
