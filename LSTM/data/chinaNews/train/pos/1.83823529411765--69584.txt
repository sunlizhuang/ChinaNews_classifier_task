Following the outbreak of Coronavirus in Wuhan and its recent spread across some countries, the Federal Government of Nigeria has vowed to give N36million cash gift to any Nigerian scientist who can find a cure for the deadly disease.

This was announced by the Minister of Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu while speaking at the send forth party organised in honour of the former director of Chemical Technology in the ministry, who recently retired.

According to the minister, Nigerian scientists need to go into research to find a cure for coronavirus so the world can know that Nigeria has the best minds.

”I am confident that our scientists have what it takes to find solution to our problems and make Nigeria be self reliant. I have no doubt in my mind that they can do it. This is the only way we can reposition our nation to be self reliant: creating jobs, fight poverty and create wealth for our people in line with President Buhari’s agenda.

We are doing our best to encourage them in this regard. I challenge them to go into research and find solution to Coronavirus so that the world will know that we have the best minds we can be proud of.

I am challenging our scientists on behalf of the Ministry, I am pledging the sum of N36million for any Nigerian scientist that finds solution to Coronavirus. We will not go to bed or rest until solution is found to this disease,” he said
