Gremlins Director Joins Secrets of the Mogwai

Gremlins: Secrets of the Mogwai just added a huge star to its team — the director that helmed the original Gremlins films. Joe Dante has joined the HBO Max animated series as a consultant. In an interview with Daily Dead, Dante confirmed the news himself.

“I’m consulting on it…It’s good,” said Dante. “It’s going to be good, yeah. I’m very pleased with the way it’s going.”

Dante also provided a quick description of what the series will be about.

“It’s a prequel,” said Dante. “[The series] goes back to the character Mr. Wing when he was a boy, and when he first discovered the Mogwai. It’s set in China in the ’20s, and it’s animated and it’s very big in the sense that if you tried to shoot it as a theatrical film, it would be outrageously expensive. But in animation, you kind of get away with almost anything you can think of.”

Dante added that “it’s probably not going to be done until 2021 or maybe the end of 2020.”

Dante brought his vision to life with the 1984 classic Gremlins. He later followed with the more humor-based sequel Gremlins 2: The New Batch six years later. Both were big hits with fans, just as Secrets of the Mogwai should be when it debuts next year.

Amblin Television and Warner Bros. Animation are producing Gremlins: Secrets of the Mogwai with Tze Chun (Gotham) as writer. Also on board are executive producers Darryl Frank, Justin Falvey, Sam Register, and Brendan Hay.
