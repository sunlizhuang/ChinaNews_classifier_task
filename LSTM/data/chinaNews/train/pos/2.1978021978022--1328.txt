KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia-China bilateral trade will hit another record high in 2019, with figures from the first 11 months already eclipsing the previous year's total at US$111bil (RM455bil), says Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia Bai Tian.

In 2018, bilateral trade between the two countries came to US$108.66bil (RM443bil).

Bai Tian, who released the trade data at a press conference on Monday (Jan 6), projected that tourist arrivals from China would hit four million in 2020 with Kuala Lumpur now allowing visa exemptions of up to 15 days for tourists from China and India.

That would represent a 33% jump as Chinese tourist arrivals in Malaysia i 2019, which exceeded three million in 2019.

However, the envoy said there was “no indication from Beijing yet” on whether it would be reciprocating Malaysia’s gesture in relaxing visa requirements.

The Malaysian government had previously announced that it would be giving visa exemptions limited to 15 days to tourists from China and India from Jan 1 to Dec 31 this year.

Malaysia has set the target of achieving 30 million tourist arrivals this year for Visit Malaysia Year 2020.
