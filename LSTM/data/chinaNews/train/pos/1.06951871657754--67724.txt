Selena Gomez tells NPR that she was scared of thunder as a child. “When I was a kid, I was terrified of thunderstorms; it would freak me out. I was in Texas, so I would assume that thunder and lightning would mean “tornado.” And so my mom, she would give me these books — and they’re the little thin books for kids to know about “What’s rain?” and “What’s this?” and she just said “The more you learn about it and how it works, the less you’re going to be afraid of it.” I think that took so much work for me.”

Dear Fonseca:

I went on a second date last Saturday night. At the end of the meal, my date asked me to place one of my rings on my ring finger. He then stunned me when he told our server we were celebrating our engagement. I smiled nervously as the server congratulated me. Our waiter then brought us two free desserts. We ate them and then quickly left the restaurant. I was shocked and told my date what we did was wrong. He said there was nothing wrong with it because the restaurant overcharges for their wine, charged us for bread and added three percent to our bill because he paid with a credit card. I ended the night confused about what we did. Was my date wrong for lying about our engagement and getting free desserts?
