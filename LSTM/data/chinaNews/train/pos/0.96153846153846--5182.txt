TAIPEI, Taiwan — Can China extend its control over Taiwan as it has over Hong Kong? Beijing certainly wants to, judging by its many and varied efforts to influence the course of Taiwan’s politics, but the people of Taiwan won’t let it, apparently. Taiwan’s presidential election on Saturday, which essentially pits the incumbent Tsai Ing-wen (who has stood up to China) against Han Kuo-yu (who promotes close ties with the mainland), is also a proxy contest about Taiwan’s identity.

The recent assertion of the people of Taiwan’s sense of being Taiwanese has been spectacular. Liao Mei, an economist at National Sun Yat-sen University, and I analyzed unpublished data from surveys conducted in March and April 2019 by my colleagues at the China Impact Studies group at Academia Sinica, and according to those, more than 73 percent of respondents did not want Taiwan to “unify with the mainland China even if it arrives at the same level of economic and political development as Taiwan.” Among respondents ages 20 to 34, the figure exceeded 93 percent.

Beijing has long tried to win the hearts of the Taiwanese politically thanks to economic incentives. But in doing so it misread their priorities. When the Academia Sinica pollsters asked respondents whether economic interest or national security was, to them, the more important issue in relations across the Taiwan Strait, about 62 percent answered national security and only about 32 percent, economic interest. (The remainder chose both.)

Since the outbreak of the Sunflower Movement in 2014 — a series of student and civic protests against a proposed free trade deal between Taiwan and the mainland — Beijing has spent lavishly on Taiwan’s young people, offering them scholarships, preferential treatment and the lure of start-up incubators. But these measures have proved ineffective so far: Ms. Tsai appears to have garnered considerable support from young voters in the current presidential race.
