After struggling for the past few years, Tesla has finally gotten its act together. Tesla Model 3 sedans are being produced to meet demand, a new factory has just got online in Shanghai, China, and a second factory will soon be built near Berlin, Germany. There's also this all-important fact: Tesla is now worth more than GM and Ford combined. Not bad at all for an automaker founded in 2003.

In fact, some auto industry and financial analysts believe Tesla poses an existential threat to mainstream automakers. Whether this is true or not remains to be seen, but there is another automaker that's also currently on an electrified vehicle sales hot streak. That company is Toyota. Forbes recently did some number crunching and the results speak for themselves.
