“Everyone knows about China and Pakistan friendship. They always help each other during tough situation. Wuhan has given me a safe and good environment for my education.

These are really hard days and no one can see their home in trouble. Everyone is encouraging Wuhan. I thought to do something special to show my love for Wuhan,” Rehman told CEN. He said, “I am thankful from the core of my heart to the Chinese Government and especially to Wuhan Government as they are doing their best to keep us safe and providing us every facility in such a tough situation.”

He added, “I am also thankful to Silk Road Institute, CUG, Wuhan administration on behalf of all Pakistani Students for their efforts. Our prayers are with you.” He also expressed his confidence that China will win the battle against coronavirus.

“I am 100 percent sure that they(Chinese) will win. As they are able to construct a 1,000-bed makeshift hospital in only 10 days, to defeat this virus is also possible; but it definitely will take a little time,” said Rehman. Rehman’s confidence comes from his understanding of Wuhan, which has been regarded as his second home after living here for over two years.
