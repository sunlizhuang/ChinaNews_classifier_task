The Southern Nevada Health Districtâ€™s Office of Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance is monitoring a number of Clark County residents returning from mainland China. Consistent with CDC guidelines, these individuals did not have symptoms after receiving a medical screening and were allowed to return home and be monitored under a 14-day self-quarantine. The number of people being monitored under these guidelines is subject to change on a daily basis.

Additionally, the Southern Nevada Public Health Laboratory has received a CDC-developed test kit and will have the capacity to test for the 2019 novel coronavirus. This will allow the Health District to receive results in a more timely manner. Only patients who meet the CDC criteria and have been assessed by a medical provider and the Health District will be tested. Moving forward and in keeping with its standard disease reporting practices, if additional Clark County residents do meet the CDC criteria of a person under investigation for the 2019 novel coronavirus and require testing, the Health District will only announce confirmed cases of the virus.
