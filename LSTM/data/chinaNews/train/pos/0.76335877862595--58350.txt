Sabah Chief Minister Shafie Apdal said only eight out of 120 senior state government positions were held by individuals from Semporna, while the rest had been taken up by those from other districts.

He dismissed claims by BN that all the positions were being held by people from Semporna.

The senior positions include state secretary, district officers, permanent secretary to the Finance Ministry, and senior officers to permanent secretaries.

Mohd Shafie further said that since taking over the leadership of Sabah, he had improved the system of administration, ensuring that only qualified individuals were entrusted with such senior positions, and that the appointments would not be undertaken randomly.

He said this in a speech at a Chinese New Year celebration held here last night.
