CORONAVIRUS | Selayang Hospital has been designated as the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) medical operations centre for Thaipusam celebrations this Saturday (Feb 8).

It is the closest public hospital to the Sri Subramaniar Swamy Temple in Batu Caves, where many Hindu devotees will be for the religious festival. Some 1.6 million people attended last year over three days of festivities.

According to Google Maps, the road distance between the two is 12.5km.

Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad told a press conference today that the hospital was already on standby for any eventualities.

“The medical operations centre will be coordinated by Selayang Hospital and it will run a range of activities aimed at preventing, curbing and responding to any possible incidents [...]

“The hospital is prepared to respond to any incidents,” he said in Putrajaya.

Meanwhile, Dzulkelfy advised those who are unwell to refrain from celebrating Thaipusam outdoors.

“Please wear a facial mask for those who want to attend the celebration,” he said.

He also urged devotees and visitors who plan to head to Batu Caves to take preventive measures by regularly washing their hands with soap and water, or with hand sanitiser.

As of Feb 6, Malaysia has recorded 14 cases of 2019-nCoV - four Malaysians and 10 China nationals.

A 40-year-old woman was identified today as the first Malaysian to have contracted the virus locally following direct contact with her elder brother.
