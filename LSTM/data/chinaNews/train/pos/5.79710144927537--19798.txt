Exceptional Sanso in Bacolod

BY CHRYSEE G. SAMILLANO

A solo art exhibit of the works of Spanish-born painter, Juvenal Sanso, is ongoing at Charlie’s Art Gallery at Italia Restaurant, Paseo Verde in Brgy. Mandalagan, Bacolod City.

Titled “Exceptional Sanso”, the exhibit features a collection of extraordinary works by the Presidential Merit of Medal awardee in celebration of his 90th birthday.

Sanso is best known for his surreal landscapes. His graphic, textured works are painted in bright palette, culled from memories of his idyllic childhood in the Philippines, full of lush plant life, and tropical skies.

For Sanso, art is the extraordinary expression of humanity by an exceptional person.

The exhibit gives a glimpse of the person behind the art, who overcame the tragedies of war through finding tranquility and peace in painting.

A multi-faceted artist, Sanso has, through the years, painted oils, watercolor, acrylic, and his favored ink and dry brush medium. He has produced fine etchings in a very dynamic, strong-lined style.

He has also distinguished himself in textile design, print making and photography, as well as designed sets and costumes for several operas in France and in the Philippines.
