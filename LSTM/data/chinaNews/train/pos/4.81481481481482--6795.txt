Zimbabwe's Vice President Constantino Chiwenga met with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi here Sunday, vowing to enhance the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries.

Chiwenga said Zimbabwe highly values its friendly relations with China, and is willing to take the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations as an opportunity to turn the political mutual trust into practical cooperation, and upgrade the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries.

He hailed China's generous help in Zimbabwe's economic and social development and welcomed more Chinese enterprises to invest and start businesses in Zimbabwe.

Chiwenga reiterated that Zimbabwe firmly adheres to the one-China policy, supports China on all issues involving its core interests, and stands together with China in international affairs.

Wang spoke highly of the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between China and Zimbabwe, saying that during the period of struggle for national liberation, China and Zimbabwe were close brothers who fought side by side; and during the current national construction process, the two countries are mutually beneficial and win-win partners.

Wang believed the southern African country has a bright future, noting China supports Zimbabwe in speeding up the pace of reform and in exploring the road to development in line with its own national conditions.

He also stressed that China is willing to share its experience in economic and social development and governance with Zimbabwe with no reservation, and continue to provide assistance and support within its capability.

Wang urged the two sides to closely coordinate and cooperate in multilateral affairs, and jointly oppose unilateralism and bullying.
