The Westin Resort Nusa Dua, Bali, has welcomed Chef Davide Allievi to lead the kitchen at its popular Italian Restaurant Prego.

Allievi arrives on the paradise island of Bali with an impressive culinary pedigree earned during a stint as Chef de Cuisine for the Michelin rated Limoni Italian Restaurant at The Ritz Carlton Guangzhou, China.

Listed among the latest wave of young and contemporary Italian Chefs, Davide brings passion, energy, and innovation to his new role at the Bali resort. Born and raised in Italy, Chef Davide has a Culinary Arts Diploma from the Istituto Paritario Professionale “Michele Pinto.” Upon completing his studies, he fine-tuned his skills with a succession of jobs in Italy and London, before relocating to Beijing, China in 2016 to work as a Sous Chef and Pastry Chef. Still in China’s capital, he shifted to the new challenge of becoming the Executive Chef at new concept eatery – Mojo winning critical acclaim in several prestigious publications, including Cosmopolitan and Vogue. With this fame came the offer of new employment as Chef de Cuisine at the Il Forno Italian Restaurant in the Grand Hyatt Shenyang.

In Bali, Chef Davide Allievi will take charge of the kitchen at Prego – an Italian and Western Concept Restaurant at The Westin Resort Nusa Dua, Bali. A favorite in Bali for its “family dining” approach to Italian cuisine, Prego is known for its generous portions of classic pasta dishes, regional specialties, and pizzas.

“We are honored to have a professional of Chef Davide’s caliber take over the culinary reins of Prego. His youth and enthusiasm will serve him well. As an Italian national, he will certainly appreciate Bali’s traditional food culture and family way of life that is sadly lacking in many parts of the world today,” says Oriol Montal, General Manager of The Westin Resort Nusa Dua, Bali.
