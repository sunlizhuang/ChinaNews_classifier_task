Sichuan Impression, a Los Angeles-based Chinese restaurant has announced a temperature screening before customers are allowed to dine at the restaurant as a preventive measure amid the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, also known as the 2019-nCoV.

The restaurant informed customers on Instagram about its plan to check the temperature of those who wish to dine there. If the person shows any abnormal symptoms such as a fever, Sichuan Impression will immediately assist them to contact the nearest hospital.

If they refuse to cooperate, the restaurant will deny them service.

“As a Chinese restaurant rooted in Los Angeles that aims at thriving the traditional Chinese culinary culture, Sichuan Impression also pays close attention to the development of this new epidemic,” the restaurant wrote.

“We at Sichuan Impression respect and enjoy having our guests who come from all corners of the world,” Sichuan Impression added. “Offering you a healthy and safe dining environment is also upheld as our top priority.”

During this time, the restaurant is encouraging everyone to order to-go and has even offered a 5% discount for all to-go orders.

“It has been 6 years since Sichuan Impression opened, and to treat everyone who comes to dine equally has always been our basic principle,” the restaurant said.

The decision came days after it was announced that there were several confirmed cases of the 2019-nCo in the United States.
