Another case of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus was reported on Sunday in Hong Kong, bringing the total number of such cases to six.

Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of Communicable Disease Branch of the Center for Health Protection of the Department of Health of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government told a press conference that a 47-year-old local resident who backed from Wuhan earlier this month was diagnosed as having the new type of pneumonia.

The man was in stable condition in Princess Margaret Hospital.

By Sunday noon, the CHP had received reports of 77 new suspected cases in the past 24 hours.

Hong Kong on Saturday raised the government response to the new coronavirus pneumonia to the highest level with a series of measures from indefinitely suspending trains and flights to and from Wuhan to schools remaining closed for a longer period.

Chung Kin-lai, director of Quality and Safety Division of the Hospital Authority, said Sunday that some new measures have been adopted in public hospitals, including suspension of visiting patients, volunteer services and internships, and making mask-wearing compulsory.

After the move of the HKSAR government, more followed suit to step up anti-epidemic efforts.

More than 10 Hong Kong universities have postponed the date of reopening or suspended classes till mid-February. Some set up body temperature test points at the entrance and asked students living on the campus to declare their health condition.

Hong Kong Disneyland park and Ocean Park, both popular tourist sites, announced temporary closures from Sunday till further notice. Ngong Ping 360 will also start to suspend cable car services, attractions, souvenir shops and other tour services from Monday.
