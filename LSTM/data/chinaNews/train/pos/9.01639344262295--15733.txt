The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) is inviting all to join in its unique Chinese New Year (CNY) 2020 celebrations organised in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Phuket to ring in the auspicious ‘Year of the Rat’. TAT is organising Chinese New Year 2020 celebrations in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Phuket, from January 22 to February 2, 2020.









TAT’s annual celebration marks the 45th anniversary of Chinese-Thai relations in 2020. It also marks the 15th year of cultural cooperation between TAT and China’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism, with 2020 being even more special as it’s the TAT’s 60th anniversary.





Yuthasak Supasorn, Governor, TAT said, “Thailand’s Chinese New Year Celebration is one of the most unique events, and biggest, outside of China. It is considered one of the most important festivals in Thailand, that each year attracts a growing number of local and international tourists. This year TAT’s CNY 2020 celebrations are focusing on traditional celebrations that can also blend in with modern activities.





“TAT’s events also graciously receive support from China with cultural performances. In turn TAT will organise a special tour for Chinese performers to experience ‘Amazing Thailand: Open to the New Shades” showcasing community and responsible tourism, so that they can share their experiences with their families and friends back home and hopefully inspire them to also visit Thailand.”
