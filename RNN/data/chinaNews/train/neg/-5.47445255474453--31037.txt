A brazen airliner is still selling flights from London to the coronavirus-ravaged Chinese city of Wuhan from as early as this weekend, MailOnline can reveal.

For as little as £205 travellers can book online with Air France to fly from Heathrow to the outbreak’s epicentre on Sunday evening.

The journey involves an overnight stay at the Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport in the French capital but arrives in Wuhan on Wednesday morning, local time.

MailOnline was able to order £549.11 return flight tickets and take them to the checkout on Air France’s website.

The plane would have supposedly flown out of Wuhan on Thursday morning bound for Heathrow.

It comes despite Wuhan and the wider Hubei province, home to around 60million people, supposedly being completely sealed off and quarantined.

Airports were reported to have been shut, planes grounded, and trains and buses banned from leaving or entering the region in a desperate bid to stop the outbreak.

The Foreign Office warned ‘against all travel to Hubei province due to the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak’, adding ‘if you are in this area and able to leave, you should do so’.

MailOnline understands airliners have been given a preliminary travel ban into the city which expires on Sunday. But it is presumed the ban will be extended.
