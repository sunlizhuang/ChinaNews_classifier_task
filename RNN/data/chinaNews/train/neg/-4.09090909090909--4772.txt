Jaguar Land Rover sales have slumped for a second year as the tougher global market and difficulties in China weighed on Britain’s biggest carmaker.

Global retail sales of its cars in 2019 came to 557,706, down 5.9pc on the previous year.

Demand has been knocked by a slump in sales of diesel cars following the Volkswagen emissions scandal, while JLR has been particularly hard hit by troubles in China, once the company’s biggest and most lucrative market.

Chinese consumers reining in spending over the past two years and unspecified troubles with JLR’s dealer network have seen the country slip behind North America, Europe and its UK home market to fourth place in the company’s sales league.

Full year sales in China fell 13.5pc, Europe was 4.9pc lower, the UK off by 1.7pc, and other markets shrank by 14.2pc.

Declining sales were a factor in JLR’s decision to axe 10pc of its worldwide staff – some 4,500 jobs – early last year, with the bulk of the cuts falling in the UK.
