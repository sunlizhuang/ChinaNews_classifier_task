(Oxford) - Two possible cases of the coronavirus are being investigated in Miami University students who just traveled to and returned from China.

The Butler County General Health District says samples were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and that both people aren't severely ill, but being kept in isolation just in case.

Anyone who's traveled to China or been around someone with the illness is most likely to contract it.

Doctors say if you meet that criteria call your physician's office first before heading in.

During a news conference this afternoon, health officials said that only the CDC can perform the test to detect the virus, and scientists there are being kept busy with suspected cases across the country.

The miami university students, who recently traveled to china, are being isolated in off-campus housing.

Officials say the threat of contracting coronavirus in the community is low.
