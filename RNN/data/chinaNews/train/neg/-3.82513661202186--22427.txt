Two Indians, who returned from China, have been kept under observation in the isolation ward of a hospital in Mumbai for possible exposure to coronavirus in the wake of an outbreak in China.

The new virus has infected a large number of people in China, prompting a health alert in the neighbouring countries.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has set up an isolation ward at its Kasturba hospital in Chinchpokali, reports our New Delhi correspondent quoting Padmaja Keskar, executive health officer of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.

She said civic health authorities have kept the two persons, who returned from China with mild cough and cold-related symptoms were put under observation.

“All private doctors in the city have been asked to alert us (the BMC) if they observe symptoms of the coronavirus in anyone who has returned from China,” Keskar said.

According to Kasturba Hospital sources, they have received detailed instructions from the Maharashtra government about the coronavirus and how to deal with the illness and they have been instructed to strictly follow those.
