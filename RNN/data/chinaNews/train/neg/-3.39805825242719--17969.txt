The travel advisory which was issued late Tuesday night was to protect passengers from the epidemic ravaging some countries and to prevent the spread of such communicable diseases into Nigeria.

In a statement issued last night by FAAN, the authority advised passengers and other airport users to comply with all quarantine procedures at the nation’s airports.

According to FAAN, all the equipment and personnel used in combatting the deadly Ebola virus in 2014 are still very much in place at the airports.

“FAAN has always had thermal scanners in her airports that monitor temperature of passengers and capture their pictures. When passengers walk pass the scanner, it registers their temperature and If too high, they are pulled aside for observation.”

FAAN, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Health, have confirmed the adequacy of the facilities at the nation’s airports to prevent the importation of the virus through the airports.

Passengers are, therefore, henceforth, expected to submit themselves for routine quarantine checks whenever they are asked to do so at the airports.
