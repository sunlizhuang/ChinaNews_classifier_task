According to WHO, Coronaviruses (CoV) belongs to a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).

Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, it informed. In order to prevent it, the agency advised regular hand washing, covering the mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing and to ensure meat and eggs are properly cooked. It also advised people to stay away from anyone who shows symptoms of respiratory illness.

"The genetic sequencing shared by China enables more countries to rapidly diagnose patients," the international health body said.

WHO said it "reiterates that it is essential that investigations continue in China to identify the source of this outbreak". WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he will consult with emergency committee members and could call for a meeting of the committee on short notice.

The infection which was first detected on December 31 last year spread rapidly in Wuhan leading to widespread SARS outbreak fears in which several hundred people had died in China in 2002-03.
