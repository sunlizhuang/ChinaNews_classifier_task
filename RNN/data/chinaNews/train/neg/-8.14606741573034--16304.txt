Tim Metcalfe looks set to face jail time after finally confessing to the police that he is a bigamist on Coronation Street .

And he could be looking at a lengthy stretch inside as those found guilty of bigamy can be jailed for up to seven years.

The week doesn't start off well for Tim (Joe Duttine) as his first wife Charlie (Sian Reeves) reveals that she is moving into the Rovers.

Frantic, Tim begs Abi to help him to try and get rid of her and, in a desperate attempt, he tells Charlie that she is "wasted" in the pub.

However this has the opposite desired effect as Charlie is flattered instead.

Tim is left even more worried when Charlie tells him that she's got an interview at Gatwick Airport and he is worried she will leave without signing the divorce papers.

So when she tells him that she has pretty managed to bag the job at Gatwick, Tim persists in asking her about the divorce papers.

Yet Charlie is evasive and makes out that it will take a few more days.

At the end of the week, Sally's return to the cobbles comes at the worst possible moment.

After returning from Gina's, Sally lets her husband know that he is still in the dog house but he reassures her that the divorce is in hand.

However Charlie ends up summoning Tim to the Rovers and confesses that she hasn't yet signed the divorce papers because she reckons they could still make a go of it.

Sally is left horrified when she realises everyone knows Tim is a bigamist and rails at him for failing to face up to his lies.

She is even more furious when he reveals he's confessed everything to the police.

Is this the end of Tim and Sally?
