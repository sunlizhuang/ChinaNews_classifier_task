A tourist visiting Thailand was urgently quarantined after being diagnosed with a new, pneumonia-like virus.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) had previously said the outbreak was believed to be contained to a seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

The mystery coronavirus originated there and has infected 42 people, killing one.

Coronaviruses are spread through coughing or sneezing or by touching an infected person.

Some cause the common cold and others can lead to more severe respiratory diseases, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

The female tourist arrived in Thailand last Wednesday where she was hospitalised, according to China's Xinhua News Agency.

No other passengers were infected and the woman has now been cleared to return to Wuhan.

Her travel comes ahead of Chinese New Year, the peak transit period for Asia and South-East Asia.

Doctors are yet to determine how the virus spreads, but don't believe it is through human-to-human transmission.

The single fatality from the virus came in December when the outbreak started.

The 61-year-old man was a regular buyer at the seafood market, who had been previously diagnosed with abdominal tumours and chronic liver disease, the health authority said.

Treatments did not improve his symptoms after he was admitted to hospital and he died on the evening of Jan. 9 when his heart failed.
