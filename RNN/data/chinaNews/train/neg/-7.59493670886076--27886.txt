Coronavirus protection: How to protect yourself from deadly virus

While 2019-CoV is a concerning disease, having infected nearly 3,000 people, it is not quite a pandemic.

China has seen the bulk of cases, with few outside of the country and its close neighbours.

For the WHO to declare a pandemic, the coronavirus would likely need to spread further afield with more cases.

The last notable pandemic took place between 2009 to 2010, when swine flu spread over the world, infecting approximately 60 million people.
