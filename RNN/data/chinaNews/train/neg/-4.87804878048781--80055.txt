South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Chinese President Xi Jinping have agreed to enhance cooperation to deal with the spread of the new coronavirus.

South Korea's presidential office says the leaders spoke by phone for about 30 minutes on Thursday.

Moon told Xi that South Korea wants to help China combat the virus, as his country shares China's suffering.

Xi said people in China have overcome their initial fears, and are now hopeful the disease caused by the virus will be beaten.

Xi added that China is ready to share with South Korea many lessons it has learned from its month-long battle against the virus.

Moon responded that he hopes the two countries will share information and cooperate, as South Korea is also doing all it can to combat the virus.

The two sides agreed to proceed with preparations for Xi's visit to South Korea in the first half of this year. They confirmed that their diplomatic officials will coordinate on the specifics of the trip.

South Korea reported more than 50 cases of infection on Thursday alone, pushing the total above 100. The country also reported its first death linked to the virus.
