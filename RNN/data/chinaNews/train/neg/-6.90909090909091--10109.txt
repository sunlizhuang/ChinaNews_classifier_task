On December 18, the US House of Representatives voted to impeach President Donald Trump and today (January 15), the House decided to send two formal charges against Mr Trump to the Senate.

The president will face charges of abuse of power for asking Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden.

The president will also face another charge of obstruction of Congress, for blocking testimony and documents sought by Democratic lawmakers.

Mrs Pelosi tweeted on Wednesday: “The Constitution and our oaths to protect it are at stake.

“That’s what the Senate must consider. #DefendOurDemocracy”
