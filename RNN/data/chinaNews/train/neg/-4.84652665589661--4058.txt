Boris Johnson has reaffirmed his commitment to the Iran nuclear deal in a 20-minute phone call with the country’s president.

The Prime Minister told Hassan Rouhani the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) retained his backing, as Downing Street said it was the “best arrangement” to avoid Tehran acquiring nuclear weapons.

It came as Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, warned that Iran’s breaches of the JCPOA were becoming “acute” and that signatories were “looking hard” at what steps to take.

Whitehall sources suggested the Dispute Resolution Mechanism contained within the deal could soon be triggered, which would begin a countdown to harsh sanctions if Iran did not come into line.

Mr Johnson also called for an end to hostilities in the Gulf in his call with President Rouhani and urged him to end the “detention and mistreatment” of British-Iranian mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and demanded her immediate release.
