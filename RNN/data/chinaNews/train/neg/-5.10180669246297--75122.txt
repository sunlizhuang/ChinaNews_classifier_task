RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- China has taken necessary stringent measures in time to contain the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), according to Brazilian experts and officials.

Given the scale of trade and travel between the countries nowadays, China's timely sharing of information with foreign experts is the key to effectively combating such an epidemic outbreak, said Marilda Siqueira, a microbiologist at Brazil's Oswaldo Cruz Foundation for medical research.

"In today's world, it's no longer possible to do science on your own or to control a disease on your own," Siqueira told Xinhua.

"Communication and the exchange of information are vital for the world to handle all of the challenges that come up," said Siqueira.

Siqueira, who heads the foundation's Respiratory Virus and Measles Laboratory, is a consultant for the World Health Organization and has many years of experience in international cooperation on infectious diseases, such as Zika.

Brazil is confident of China's fight against the outbreak, which was clearly demonstrated in its decision not to impose any travel restrictions on Chinese visitors.

More than 300,000 Chinese people live in Brazil, according to Chinese Ambassador to Brazil Yang Wanming, adding that he has received numerous messages of sympathies from Brazilians.

Due to Brazil's own struggle with a Zika outbreak in 2015 and its long-running battle against dengue, Brazilians have a better understanding of how to deal with epidemics, Yang said.

They know, for example, that "rumors and panic can cause more fear than the epidemic itself," he said.

Brazilian diplomat Germano Correa traveled to the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, to evacuate Brazilian nationals, and has been with them throughout their quarantine in Anapolis in central Brazil.

Correa told Xinhua that the Chinese authorities were quick to take efficient procedures needed to help evacuate the Brazilian nationals.

Brazilian think tank BRICS Policy Center held a seminar on the potential impact of the coronavirus on the global economy and policy, in which Li Yang, China's consul general in Rio de Janeiro, predicted that the health crisis could affect China's economy in the short term, while some sectors, such as new technologies and artificial intelligence, may see a development boost.

The crisis could also contribute to multilateral institutions and global governance through stepped-up exchanges in information, experience and cooperation between countries in a bid to prevent future outbreaks, said Li. Enditem
