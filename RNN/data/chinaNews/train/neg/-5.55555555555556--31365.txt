More than 100 people have died from a coronavirus outbreak that started in Wuhan, China, and over 4,500 people have been infected across the world.

As the outbreak has spread, China has moved to stop people leaving and entering cities linked to the disease.

Last Thursday morning, authorities in Wuhan shut down the city's public transportation, including buses, trains, ferries, and the airport.

As of Tuesday local time, 14 cities in Hubei province are locked down, accounting for a population of over 50 million people. Several media outlets estimate the number of people locked down at 56 million.

The effects of the shutdown have been widespread: Several large foreign and Chinese corporations, including McDonald's, Ikea, and French carmakers Peugeot Citroen and Renault are temporarily shutting down operations and evacuating employees from the area.

And several countries, including the US, UK, and Canada, have warned against all non-essential travel to China and Hubei province as the virus continues to spread around the world.
