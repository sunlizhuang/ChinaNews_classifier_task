It should come as no surprise that the figures from China about coronavirus infections and deaths have been massaged. As the crisis in Xi Jinping's government from his mishandling of the situation mounts, the biggest winner is now becoming clear. It's looking more and more likely that Donald J Trump will win re-election in November - and equity markets love it.

Napoleon said that he'd rather his generals be "lucky" than "good" - and Mr Trump is turning out to be a very lucky general indeed. The coronavirus outbreak has given the US president a "get out of jail free card" when it comes to the phase-one trade deal, signed just a few weeks ago.

The preliminary deal was met with much cynicism, as the level of purchases - particularly of agricultural products from his rural base - looked utterly unrealistic. The agreement called for Chinese purchases of US farm goods to increase by $32 billion over two years, or roughly $16 billion a year. When combined with the $24 billion US agricultural export baseline in 2017, the total gets close to $40 billion.

But this was never going to happen. The outbreak of African swine fever in the country's pig population led to mass slaughter of animals on infected farms, so demand for soya beans as feed has plunged. China's output of pork slumped 21.8 per cent year on year in 2019, the lowest level since 2003.
