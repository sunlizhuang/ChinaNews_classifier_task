Taipei, Feb. 6 (CNA) The Tourism Bureau announced Thursday the suspension of all tours to Hong Kong and Macau until Feb. 29, with the exception of tour groups that are merely transiting through the two special administrative regions.

The measure is a response to the Central Epidemic Command Center's (CECC) raising of its travel alert for the two regions Wednesday to the second level in its three-tier warning system, the bureau said.

The bureau has barred tour groups from traveling to the rest of China since Jan. 25, due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

To date, over 28,000 people have been infected with the virus in China, leading to more than 560 deaths, including one in Hong Kong.

Meanwhile, as part of the latest CECC measures to combat the spread of the virus, all people from China, apart from those from Hong Kong and Macau, have been denied entry into Taiwan from Thursday.

From Friday, Chinese nationals from Hong Kong and Macau will be subject to a mandatory 14-day home quarantine when they enter Taiwan, while foreign nationals who have traveled to China, Hong Kong, and Macau in the past 14 days, or who are residents in the three regions, will be barred from entry to Taiwan.

Taiwanese nationals who have traveled recently to China, Hong Kong or Macau are all subject to a mandatory 14-day home quarantine, beginning Thursday, Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥), deputy-director of Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control, told CNA.
