(Bloomberg) -- China will start nationwide screening to tackle the growing outbreak of a new respiratory virus, with hundreds of millions set to travel during the looming Lunar New Year holiday.

Officials will improve monitoring of transportation links nationwide, and adopt the most strict measures to monitor those with fever, the National Health Commission said in a briefing in Beijing Wednesday.

The commission said the death toll from the disease has risen to nine, with three additional deaths in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged. There have been 440 confirmed cases across 13 provinces as of Jan. 21, the commission said. Some 1,394 patients are under medical observation.
