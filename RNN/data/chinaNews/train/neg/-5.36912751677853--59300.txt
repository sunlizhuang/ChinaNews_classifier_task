Xie Feng, commissioner of Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong SAR, said China is confident in containing the spread of the coronavirus while calling on international communities to pull together in the fight against the epidemic.

Addressing a meeting at the commissioner's office on Friday morning, Xie said concerted efforts have been made by Chinese people to curb the outbreak under the guidance of the central government. More than 66 billion yuan has been allocated and over 20 tons of medical supplies are delivered hour-by-hour to support efforts to contain the epidemic.

Xie said China is sincere in engaging the international community to contain the outbreak by providing timely and transparent information to the world.

He cited an example of Chinese integrity and accountability, saying that the Chinese authorities instantly notified Germany about an infected patient who was only confirmed until she came back from Germany.

However, he condemned discrimination, insult and even assaults against Chinese and other Asians in some countries and regions, citing for example two Asian parents had received intimidating email messages asking them to keep their children at home and accusing them as "virus spreaders".

At this critical juncture, Xie called on all the nations to guard against the spread of "the virus of discrimination, hatred and racism".

To date, the deadly novel coronavirus has infected more than 30,000 people on the Chinese mainland and killed over 630.

The meeting was attended by over 80 representatives from the foreign legations in Hong Kong, business associations and intergovernmental organizations from 32 countries, including the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Japan and Australia.
