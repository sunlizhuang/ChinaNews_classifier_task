Car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover has flown parts in suitcases from China to the United Kingdom as the coronavirus takes a toll on its supply chain.

Jaguar Lange Rover is the UK's largest carmaker, with three factories across the country which manufacture almost 40,000 cars every year.

Car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover said the coronavirus takes a toll on its supply chain.

The company's boss Ralf Speth said it could begin to fall short of Chinese car parts for UK factories in as little as two weeks.

"We are safe for this week and we are safe for next week and in the third week we have ... parts missing," the BBC quotes Mr Speth saying at an event in Coventry.

"We have flown parts in suitcases from China to the UK," he said.

The effects of the coronavirus have impacted global supply chains, with Apple concerned that the virus could affect iPhone stock.

Many car companies expected to commence operations in China this week.

Reopened manufacturers have warned others that it will take longer than expected to return to full capacity operations.

However, some companies have already announced their shut-down such as Fiat Chrysler which said its factories in Serbia would close due to missing parts from China.

US Labour union officials also raised concern General motors would halt operations due to supply shortages.

Jaguar Land Rover said in a statement its direct supply chain is primarily European and, in the UK, with a small percentage in China.

Mr Speth raised concerns over sales in China, which have "completely stopped".

"It's zero," he said.
