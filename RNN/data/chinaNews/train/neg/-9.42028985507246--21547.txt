Over the seven years of his rule President Xi has come down hard on dissent and dramatically boosted the state’s surveillance powers

A Chinese graduate has been jailed for allegedly denigrating President Xi on social media while studying in the US.

Luo Daiqing, 20, was detained in July after returning to China from the University of Minnesota. He received a six-month prison sentence in November for “provocation”, according to court papers examined by the Axios news website.

The sentence was described as ruthless and paranoid by Ben Sasse, a Republican senator, who called for Mr Luo’s release.

The documents stated that Mr Luo “used his Twitter account to post more than 40 comments denigrating a national leader's image”.

His posts allegedly included images of Lawrence Limburger, a cartoon villain from the children’s TV series Biker Mice from Mars, whose looks have been compared to President Xi’s.
