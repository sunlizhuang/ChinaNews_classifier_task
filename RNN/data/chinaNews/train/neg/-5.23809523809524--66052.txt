Feb 10 (Reuters) - London base metals advanced on Monday on fears of a supply shortage in China, a major producer of base metals, where a coronavirus outbreak has killed over 900 people and threatened to disrupt the global supply chain.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) rose 0.6% to $5,693.50 a tonne by 0725 GMT, nickel jumped 1.8% to $12,995 a tonne, zinc rose 1.1% to $2,167.50 a tonne, tin advanced 2% to $16,500 a tonne, while lead edged down 0.1% to $1,815 a tonne.

China’s nonferrous metal output will fall at least 10% year-on-year in February, as the country battles the virus outbreak but operations are expected to normalise after the second quarter, the country’s metal association said.

“Before the price consolidation, the main concern was demand destruction due to China’s economic slowdown and lockdown, but as the situation develops, it seems that supply is also disrupted,” said analyst Helen Lau of Argonaut Securities.

“Prices might weaken going forward but not too much,” Lau said.
