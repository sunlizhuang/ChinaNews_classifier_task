The coronavirus outbreak has now killed at least 362 people and infected more than 17,300 globally, as it continues to spread beyond China. One person outside mainland China, a man in the Philippines, has died. The virus has now been confirmed in more than 25 countries and territories since it was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. Nearly 60 million people remain under lockdown in Chinese cities as international researchers race to develop a vaccine and halt its spread.

Hong Kong will close major borders with China in a bid to control the spread of the deadly virus. Government officials said that the main land borders at Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau would shut as of midnight tonight, as would the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal. That will leave all but three border crossings between Hong Kong and mainland China closed. Those which remain open are the city’s international airport, the Shenzhen Bay border and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge.

Meanwhile the Chinese government has accused the US of causing panic in it’s response to the Coronavirus. The accusation comes after the US declared a public health emergency on Friday and said it would deny entry to foreign nationals who had visited China in the past two weeks. Chinese Foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said the US actions “could only create and spread fear”.
