China said it may postpone the annual congress as the virus continues to spread globally, with most cases in China, where the virus originated, according to The Associated Press.

The standing committee for the National People’s Congress said it believes it's necessary to postpone the annual congress to prioritize people’s lives, safety and health, the AP reported, citing the official Xinhua News Agency.
