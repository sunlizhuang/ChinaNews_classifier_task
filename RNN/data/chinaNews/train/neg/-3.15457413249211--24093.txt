SACRAMENTO, Calif. (KTXL) — The director of the California Department of Public Health released a YouTube video Friday reassuring Californians there have been no novel coronavirus cases in the state — yet.

“Based on current information, the immediate health risk to the general public in California is low,” said State Public Health Officer Dr. Sonia Angell.

The CDPH is also working with other agencies and local organizations during this time, according to Dr. Angell.

The novel coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, and has “respiratory symptoms similar to the flu,” including runny nose, headache, cough, sore throat, fever and shortness of breath.

Dr. Angell said the symptoms can be mild and on occasion severe.

“Passengers arriving from Wuhan, China, are being screened at both San Francisco International and Los Angeles International airports,” Angell said.

Angell said that although there have been no cases yet it is likely there will be some cases.

“We will see some and we are ready,” Angell said.
