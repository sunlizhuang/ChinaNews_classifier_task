The Japanese government will ban people from the Chinese province of Zhejiang from entering the country starting Thursday, to help contain the spread of the new coronavirus in the country.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made the announcement at a meeting of a taskforce dealing with the virus outbreak on Wednesday.

Abe also referred to virus tests on passengers and crewmembers aboard the Diamond Princess, where 174 cases of infection have been confirmed.

He said he plans to increase the number of tests that can be carried out from about 300 per day to at least 1,000 with the cooperation of municipal and private-sector facilities.

Abe also said he plans to allow local governments to test people with symptoms for the virus.

China's coastal province of Zhejiang has a population of about 57 million.

Local health authorities say the number of people there who are infected with the new coronavirus reached 1,131 as of Tuesday.

Among those with the virus are 481 people who were infected in Wenzhou, a city with close business links to Hubei, the province at the outbreak's epicenter.

China's e-commerce giant Alibaba is headquartered in Zhejiang's capital city of Hangzhou along with many IT firms.

It's estimated that about 500 Japanese firms also have footholds in Zhejiang Province including electronics giants Panasonic and Toshiba.

Provincial tourism authorities say Japan is a top overseas destination for people from the province with 685,000 visitors last year alone.

Authorities in the city of Wenzhou are enforcing restrictions on residents leaving home for shopping and other purposes in an effort to contain the outbreak. Only one person from each household can leave home every other day.
