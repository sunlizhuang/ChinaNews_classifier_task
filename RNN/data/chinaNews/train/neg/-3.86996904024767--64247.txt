THE ISSUE: Coronavirus still a low-risk situation in La Salle County

OUR VIEW: Listen to health professionals and take commonsense precautions

Be smart.

That’s the biggest takeaway from recent developments in the ongoing story of coronavirus, a new malady originating in China that has gotten the world’s attention as the death toll rises and cases are confirmed in rare instances across the globe.

Late last month a La Salle County Health Department official said the agency gets daily briefings from the Centers for Disease Control and the Illinois Department of Public Health. The Cook County Health Department said the risk to the general public is low, noting although there are two confirmed coronavirus patients in Chicago, there is every reason to believe officials have the situation under control and are taking proper precautions.

We understand these developments raise suspicion, and appreciate agencies that use honest phrases like “low risk” and not blithe statements like “no cause for concern.” Whether it’s SARS, H1N1 ebola or some other potential pandemic, it’s all too easy to envision the worst-case scenario. Media outlets report on things like coronavirus because new things are news, and the public wants to be informed. Unfortunately, that desire to present information can feed a belief the problem is bigger or more dangerous than reality reveals. Then reports trying to assuage concerns just add to the noise around the developing topic and a challenging cycle takes another spin.

Our reporting on the local response to the situation has revealed what we consider an appropriate degree of caution. Flipo Group President Jerry Philippeau is optimistic he can still make a planned business trip to China in April. Students from China enrolled at Peru’s St. Bede Academy and Streator High School likewise are paying close attention — not because their families are in imminent danger but because getting unvarnished truth during these early uncertain days requires extra levels of diligence.

St. Bede scrapped an April field trip to China’s Hunan province, where most of its Chinese boarding students are from, because at this juncture administrators felt it was wrong to keep investing time and money in preparations if the virus made their travel impossible. It was a difficult decision, surely, but also one born of prudence and analysis

Likewise, we encourage our readers to maintain a degree of caution with matters of public health, but that’s just common sense anyway, especially in the middle of an active flu season. The CDC said current conditions don’t indicate a need for the general public to invest in surgical masks and cautioned against consumers rushing to purchases masks as that might cause a shortage for the health care providers who need them for work.

“The spread here seems to involve a fair amount of close contact for a fairly extended period of time,” said Dr. Paul Bonucci, emergency department medical director at Peru’s Illinois Valley Community Hospital. “It’s not as if passing someone on the street or seeing them for a minute at work is going to be a way the disease spreads.”

The La Salle County Health Department offers commonsense tips that should decrease susceptibility to flu, coronavirus and other transmittable diseases:

• Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and if soap and water aren’t available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

• Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

• Avoid close contact with people who are sick with respiratory symptoms.

• Stay home when you are sick.

• Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

• Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

So in the end, be smart: listen to what the health professionals say directly — not the spin on their comments — and employ good hygiene practices. It always makes sense to be aware of risks facing you and your family, but undue panic helps nothing.
