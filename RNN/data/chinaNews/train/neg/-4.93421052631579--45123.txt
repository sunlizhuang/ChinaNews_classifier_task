Most cases detected in Hubei

Most of the country’s deaths and confirmed cases have been in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak.

According to CNA, an additional 1,921 cases were detected in Hubei province, taking the total in the region to 9,074.

The top Communist Party official in Wuhan expressed “remorse” on Friday because local authorities acted too slowly.

The virus is believed to have emerged last year in December, linked to an exotic meat market that sold wild game within the city.

It was reported that 330 patients in China have been discharged after recovering from the disease.
