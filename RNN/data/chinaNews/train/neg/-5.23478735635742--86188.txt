Without volunteer drivers, the women would not even be able to attend their scheduled doctor’s appointments.

One network of volunteers in Wuhan is trying to help women find hospitals that still offer prenatal and postpartum care. The group — which includes psychological workers and drivers — is working with more than 600 pregnant women and new mothers in and around the city, and offers 24-hour service to help deal with emergencies.

Jane Huang was recently connected with the volunteers. The 40-year-old mother of one is 17 weeks pregnant, but the district hospital where she is registered is no longer open to pregnant women. Ms. Huang worries that if she does not find a hospital soon, neither she nor her baby will survive because of her hypertension and fragile kidney.

“I worry every day about whether my child will die in my belly. I worry if there is an early delivery, it will not be able to survive,” Ms. Huang said by phone. “I worry about the financial burdens if I have to do dialysis or even change my kidney, I worry that if my child has an abnormality, should I bring it into to the world.”

“I think about a lot of things every day,” she said.
