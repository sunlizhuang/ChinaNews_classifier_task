A man returned Saturday from China is under observation at Hospital Curry Cabral, in Lisbon, on suspicion of infection by the new virus detected in that country, announced the Directorate-General for Health (DGS).

“Regarding the outbreak of pneumonia due to new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), starting in China, the Directorate-General for Health informs that the first suspected case of infection with a new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is being evaluated in Portugal”, says DGS, in a note published on its website.

According to the information, this patient returned from China, where he was in the last days in Wuhan, the city where the virus was initially detected, and is “under observation” at the Curry Cabral Hospital, a “reference unit for these situations”.

The Directorate-General for Health also indicates that the patient’s clinical situation “is stable”, pending the results of ongoing laboratory tests.

The symptoms associated with the infection caused by this new coronavirus are more intense than the flu and include fever, pain, general malaise and breathing difficulties, including shortness of breath.

In Portugal, DGS had already activated preventive public health devices, while the European Center for Disease Control raised the risk of contagion in the European Union to “moderate”, continuing to monitor the situation and carry out rapid risk assessments.

Two dozen Portuguese had been referred to by the Government on Friday as residents or visiting Wuhan.

According to the government office, of these 20 citizens, “14 people were already registered as residents in Wuhan at the Portuguese embassy in Beijing”.
