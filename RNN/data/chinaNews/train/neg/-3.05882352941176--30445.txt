Three University of Washington students who recently traveled to Wuhan, China, are being screened for the new coronavirus that originated there, according to a notification emailed to students Sunday evening.

The virus has infected thousands of people and killed dozens in China since being discovered last month. Three cases have been confirmed in the United States this month, including a man in Snohomish County.

Like the Snohomish County patient, who is now being monitored in an isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, the three UW students developed symptoms after returning home from Wuhan. None needed to be hospitalized, and “all are doing very well,” according to the university’s email.

One student, who lives off campus, tested negative, according to the university’s email. The other two are still awaiting their test results as of Sunday evening; they live on campus but have moved to isolated housing until Public Health – Seattle & King County clears them.

“They’ve been moved to some emergency units that we have available within our housing system,” said Victor Balta, a University of Washington spokesman, who added that the university was operating with “an abundance of caution.”
