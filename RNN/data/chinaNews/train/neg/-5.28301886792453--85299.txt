Rankin County receives less damage than surrounding counties.

MEMA will seek federal assistance for individuals and local governments.

Number of damaged homes could change after assessments completed.

Around 450 homes were damaged in Hinds and Madison counties from flooding in the Jackson metro area earlier this month.

Before the flooding from the Pearl River started, officials had projected up to 2,500 structures, including about 1,000 homes, could be affected.

Mississippi Emergency Management officials said Monday in an email the number is a rough estimate and is likely to change.

MEMA said last week it would seek federal assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for individuals whose homes were damaged as well as counties with damaged infrastructure, buildings and equipment, spokeswoman Malary White said. MEMA also will seek help from the U.S. Small Business Association, which often issues federal low-interest disaster loans.

Hinds County must document at least $942,000 in damage to to obtain federal money under a disaster declaration for public infrastructure, and Rankin County must show at least $544,000 in damages, White said.

The shelter in Jackson has closed, but a resource center at Christ United Methodist Church, 6000 Old Canton Road in Jackson, remains open until 5 p.m. Tuesday.

The resource center opened Friday to assist flood victims and has received 124 work orders.
