Three cases were recently reported in California, where a 57-year-old man who travelled to China exposed himself and his wife to the virus. The state's health department officials also confirmed a Bay Area patient who recently returned from outbreak epicentre Wuhan.



The US government has imposed drastic travel restrictions to prevent travel into the US from China, denying entry to foreign nationals who have recently visited the country and subjecting travellers to quarantine for up to two weeks after returning to the US.

Travel restrictions follow suspended flight services from most commercial airlines. All remaining Chinese travel to the US is being funnelled into seven US airports, where passengers will face additional screening and possible self-quarantine.

This week, several planes carrying passengers from Wuhan into the US will be directed to three military bases, where passengers will be screened, monitored and evaluated by personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before they're quarantined for two weeks.​

CDC officials have assured that the risk of coronavirus exposure to the general public in the US remains low.
