LANSING, Mich. — Michigan’s health department says test results on all four possible cases of coronavirus in the state came back negative.

Three samples were sent in for testing by the Centers for Disease Control and came back negative on Monday. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services sent a fourth possible case in Monday after the Washtenaw County Health Department discovered another person presenting minor symptoms of the disease.

State health officials say they are not aware of any more possible cases of coronavirus in Michigan at this time.

However, the situation is still being actively monitored at the state and federal levels.

The CDC is screening passengers coming into the U.S. through 20 points of international entry, including the Detroit Metro Airport. Delta has temporarily suspended all U.S. flights to China, where the outbreak originated, through April 30.

Over 200 people have died from the disease in China. There have only been six cases in the U.S. to this point, and none have been fatal.
