TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Japan is aiming to send a charter flight Tuesday evening for those of its citizens who wish to return home from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of a deadly virus outbreak, a government official said.

"There is no plan for this morning, but we are making arrangements as to whether it can go tonight," the official said.

The government said Monday that Tokyo hoped to dispatch a charter flight Tuesday at the earliest to the Chinese city of 11 million, which has been on a virtual lockdown since last week.

The pneumonia-causing coronavirus has killed at least 82 in China, mostly in Wuhan, and infected more than 2,800 globally.
