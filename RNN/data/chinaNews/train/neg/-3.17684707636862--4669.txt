Key Point: "Peace disease" is a real consequence of relying on technology that have never been tried on the battlefield.

China’s rapid military modernisation has triggered an intense discussion about Australia’s defence priorities, reviving old debates about an independent ‘defence of Australia’ doctrine or a deeper alliance with the United States. Missing from that debate, however, is an understanding of the weaknesses and shortcomings of the People’s Liberation Army.

Arguably the most important of these for Australian defence planners to understand is what Chinese President Xi Jinping calls the PLA’s ‘peace disease’ (和平病). This malaise, basically a lack of combat experience, has been blamed by Chinese commentators on an inability to train under realistic conditions and goes to the heart of the Chinese Communist Party’s worries about the PLA’s capability.

The CCP is concerned that the PLA doesn’t understand the intensity of modern combat. In a recent article for the PLA’s official newspaper, the People’s Liberation Army Daily (解放军报), Chen Yongyi and Liu Yuanyuan write that ‘during times of war troops are engaged in battle with the enemy insight’. They argue that being in proximity to the enemy helps PLA personnel become aware of both the responsibilities and challenges of the modern battlespace. While some generals might bemoan a lack of combat experience, finding a way to address the problem short of outright war would allow the PLA to further narrow the gap with the US military.
