College monitoring individuals who visited China for virus

WATERVILLE, Maine (AP) — Members of a Maine college community who recently visited China are being monitored in isolation for the new virus.

Colby College is keeping certain community members in isolation for as long as 14 days “out of abundance of caution” even though none of them nor anyone in the state has been confirmed to have the virus, the Kennebec Journal reported Friday.

In a statement posted on its website Thursday, the college said, “None of the individuals in isolation have any symptoms of the virus, and they are being monitored per CDC guidelines."

The school said it is isolating the individuals based on a public health guidance that has been issued for those returning from mainland China.

The vast majority of the confirmed cases are in mainland China.

Citing federal privacy laws, George Sopko, a spokesman for the college, declined to say how many individuals were in isolation, where the isolation was taking place and whether the group included students, staff and faculty.
