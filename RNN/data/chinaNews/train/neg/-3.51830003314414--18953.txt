Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus

WHO is not yet ready to decide if the Chinese coronavirus outbreak is a global public health emergency.

An emergency committee convened by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, MSc, met for the first time today to review the ongoing outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China, and was split on whether to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

Tedros said they would need another day to discuss whether the outbreak meets the criteria for a PHEIC.

“Today there was an excellent discussion during the committee meeting, but it was clear that to proceed, we need more information. For that reason, I have decided to ask the emergency committee to meet again tomorrow to continue their discussion,” Tedros said in a briefing.

“The decision about whether or not to declare a public health emergency of international concern is one I take extremely seriously, and one I am only prepared to make with appropriate consideration of all the evidence.”

According to Tedros, WHO staff on the ground in China are working with local officials and experts to gather more information that will be discussed tomorrow.

To date, there have been more than 400 confirmed cases reported in China, including 17 deaths, according to Chinese state media. Officials have reported additional cases in Thailand, Japan, South Korea and the United States.

Chinese officials said they will temporarily halt public transportation in Wuhan beginning Thursday morning and will cancel all flights and trains leaving from the city to reduce the risk for spread. The travel ban comes on the eve of the Chinese New Year, which begins Saturday. – by Caitlyn Stulpin
