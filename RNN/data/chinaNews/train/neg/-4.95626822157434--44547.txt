While two Canadians languish in a Chinese prison, our government considers allowing the Chinese Company Huawei to build out the nation’s 5G telecommunications network.

First, let’s not confuse the People’s Republic of China (PRC) with the people of China.

The PRC is a collection of corrupt, murderous, dangerous tyrants who have imprisoned, impoverished and systemically denied freedom, equality and humanity to their own people. The PRC controls every inch of society, spying on its own people, managing every aspect of their economy and using human lives as bargaining chips.

The militant dictates of the Chinese Communist Party do not end at China’s borders. They have a global network of spies that have been routinely caught stealing technologies and scientific research while also trying to infiltrate and compromise governments around the world.

It is calculated. It is strategic. It is the PRC’s global vision. And it is anything but benign.

How could our federal government even contemplate giving Huawei (the Chinese telecommunications giant) access to our telecommunications network?

The People’s Republic of China passed the “Intelligence Law” in 2017 that requires any company to hand over any 5G data if the government asks for it.

At the time, Senior Foreign Relations expert Jeremy Cohen warned: “There is no way Huawei can resist any order from the (People’s Republic of China) government or the Chinese Communist Party to do its bidding in any context, commercial or otherwise.”

“Huawei would have to turn over all requested data and perform whatever other surveillance activities are required,” said Jerome Cohen, a New York University law professor and Council on Foreign Relations adjunct senior fellow.

Huawei claims it is a private company but cannot explain its ownership, beyond some comical tale of a “blue book.” Its founder was a dedicated solider in China’s People Liberation Army and remains a prominent member of China’s Communist Party. But it’s not as if either of those things are choices in China.

Whether Huawei executives claim the company is private or not is inconsequential. It was the Chinese government that arrested two Canadians — Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor — and tossed them in jail on trumped up charges as retaliation for the RCMP’s arrest of Huawei’s Meng Wanzhou.

If Huawei is not under the control of the PRC, then why was the response so swift and diabolical? It’s obvious to anyone, except our own naive, Pollyanna government, that Huawei is the PRC.

Security experts are concerned using Huawei equipment in our 5G network in Canada will expose information to so-called “back-door” eavesdropping. Huawei is already accused of espionage in Holland and Poland and faces charges in the U.S. for stealing robotic technology from T-Mobile.

China has been accused of hacking any number of networks for its own interests. Almost daily there are reports of Chinese espionage in countries around the world. Last week alone, three Germans were arrested for alleged espionage for the Chinese government and German diplomat Gerhard Sabathil was arrested for allegedly exchanging sensitive information to his “companion” — a Chinese spy.

Closer to home, Harvard’s Chemistry Chair was charged with lying to the Department of Defence about income received from the Chinese Government.

In 2018 former Spy Chief Dick Fadden with Brian Lee Crowley penned an opinion piece warning Canada’s government about Huawei and the Chinese penchant for esponiage,

The close relationship between Huawei and a Chinese government with a history of cyber espionage should be worrisome. Add the fact that China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law gives Beijing the power to compel Huawei’s support for its intelligence work, and the red flags become too numerous to ignore.

The pattern is clear, the intent is clear, and to allow Huawei into our telecommunications network is to risk all information that passes through it. A big risk to our national security and a big risk for companies that do business here.

If ever there was a time for virtue signalling followed up by real action from this federal government, it is now, and it is with Huawei.

Minister Bill Blair, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stand on principle, for the men in Chinese jails, for security of our country and say NO to Huawei.

THOUSAND TALENTS PLAN

After the recent arrest of Harvard’s Chemistry Chair Charles Lieber for lying to the U.S. Department of Defense about millions of dollars he received from the Chinese government, there have been countless questions about China’s Thousand Talents Plan.

The U.S. government appears to have egg on its face after funding $15 million for Liber’s nanotechnology research while he participated in this oddly, suspicious Chinese government program called the “Thousand Talents Program.”

It began in 2008 to recruit researchers around the globe to share breakthroughs with the Chinese government. In 2018 the U.S. Congress was warned by Texas Tech University that the program was “part of a broader strategy to build technological superiority” and that the State Department and Congress believed elements of the plan to be “closely allied to the Chinese military.”

WHO IS MENG WANZHOU?

Huawei CEO Meng Wanzhou was arrested by the RCMP on Dec. 1, 2018 at the request of the U.S. government.

The charges include defrauding multiple financial institutions in breach of the U.S. ban on dealings with Iran. She has been under house arrest in one of her million dollar mansions until the extradition hearing is concluded.

Wanzhou is also the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, a former soldier in the People’s Liberation Army and a prominent member of the Communist Party of China

In response to Wanzhou’s arrest, the Chinese government arrested two Canadians on trumped up charges and put them in solitary confinement in what we can assume is a hell hole of a jail. They have been there for over a year.

The Canadian government has not decided whether to allow Huawei to supply and build our 5G network.
