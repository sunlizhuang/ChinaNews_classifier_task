The World Health Organization (WHO) is concerned about the number of coronavirus cases with no clear epidemiological link, although the total number of cases outside China remains relatively small, its director general has said.

Cases with no clear link include those with no travel history to China or contact with a confirmed case, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a briefing.

There is also concern at the disease's ability to stay undetected in people who can unknowingly spread it to others. A 20-year-old woman travelled from Wuhan to a city 675km away where she infected five others, Chinese scientists said on Friday, despite showing no symptoms herself.

"You had this patient from Wuhan where the virus is, traveling to where the virus wasn't," Dr William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told Reuters.

"She remained asymptomatic and infected a bunch of family members and you had a group of physicians who immediately seized on the moment and tested everyone."

The scientists behind the report said if that's common, COVID-19 could be harder to control than previously believed.
