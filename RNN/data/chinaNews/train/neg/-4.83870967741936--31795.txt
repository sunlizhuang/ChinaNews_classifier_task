Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne and Health Minister Patty Hajdu hold a news conference in Ottawa on the coronavirus outbreak. They face questions on whether Canada will evacuate its citizens who are in China amid the outbreak. The new virus is believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has spread to other countries including Canada, the United States, France and Australia. Canada’s first confirmed case involves a man in his 50s who returned to Toronto after visiting Wuhan, while the second presumptive case is his wife. One presumptive case has also been confirmed in British Columbia. (January 28, 2020) (no interpretation)
