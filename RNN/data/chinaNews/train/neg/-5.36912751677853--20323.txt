Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said there is an "increased likelihood" of cases of the new coronavirus in the UK - but insisted the risk to the public remains low and the country is "well prepared".

In a Commons statement, he told MPs: "The chief medical officer has revised the risk to the UK population from 'very low' to 'low' and has concluded that while there is an increased likelihood that cases may arise in this country, we are well prepared and well equipped to deal with them."

The virus causes respiratory symptoms and has been linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, the largest city in central China. A growing number of deaths linked to the conditions have been reported, with cases also confirmed elsewhere.

A coronavirus case has now been declared in the USA after a 30-year-old man returned from China, with fears the disease could spread worldwide.

Cases have also been reported in Thailand, South Korea and Japan.

China confirmed 571 total cases of the new coronvirus outbreak. As of Wednesday evening, 17 deaths have been reported, all in Hubei province. Around 20 medical workers have also been infected, MirrorOnline reports .

Actual figures are likely to be much higher, with leading Virologists suggesting billions could be at risk.

Chinese authorities have ordered a stop to travel in and out of Wuhan, and cars are understood to have been blocked by officals.

Professor Neil Ferguson, director of the Medical Research Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, said the estimated number of people infected with coronavirus in Wuhan is around 4,000, with a range between 1,000 and 9,700.
