"They may be surprised but it is a reality. If they consider that reality to be fabricated then what else can I say?" Terawan said on Tuesday.

Not all are convinced. Belinda Ibrahim, 23, an accountant in Jakarta, said she was horrified by continued spread of the virus and simply didn't know if it had been carried into her country or not.

"Indonesia covers a very large area. It's possible some people may have contracted the virus but wouldn't know they had it," Ms Ibrahim said.

Her employer was taking the threat seriously, advising all employees to wear masks at work. This is becoming a commonplace instruction in Jakarta office blocks and, as in other Asian cities, masks are getting scarce. All over the city, chemists say that as soon as new stocks come in, they are quickly depleted.

In Bali, the tourism industry's battle to convince would-be travellers it is free of the virus has become much harder following confirmation a Chinese tourist who holidayed on the island last month tested positive after returning home.

Bali is still playing host to hundreds of Chinese tourists who can't go home after Indonesia suspended all flights to and from mainland China on February 5.

Some of those affected have tried to travel on to other destinations but their choice is limited, with more than 60 countries imposing some form of restriction on Chinese travellers.

These range from an outright ban adopted by Indonesia, Australia, Singapore and the United States, to restrictions limited to Chinese from the Hubei Province, the epicentre of the outbreak, to increased screening measures.

Thailand is one of the few south-east Asian nations that hasn't changed the rules. As of Friday, it had confirmed 33 coronavirus cases but was still waiving visa-on-arrival fees for tourists from 18 countries, including China.
