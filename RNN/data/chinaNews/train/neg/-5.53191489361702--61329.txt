Five public school students are sticking to the Guam Department of Education's new preventative policy for coronavirus, which mandates a 14-day excused absence, according to education officials.

The five students who are staying home will be able to return to school before the end of next week, said Guam DOE Superintendent Jon Fernandez.

Fernandez said Guam DOE is requiring that they abide by the excused absence policy.

There are no coronavirus cases on Guam.

On Feb. 5, Fernandez sent a letter that said staff and students are to required to be absent for 14 days if they:

recently returned from China;

had direct contact with anyone who recently returned from China; or

who are showing respiratory symptoms like coughing, shortness of breath or fever.

Students who are absent will be given the necessary school assignments and the absences will be counted as excused. Staff that are affected will be placed on leave.

"Staff with travel history and symptoms will also complete a nurse assessment in collaboration with (the Department of Public Health and Social Services)," the letter stated.
