He also noted that today in Poltava, one of the detainees will appear before the court today in Poltava. In addition, law enforcement agencies verify that people from other cities and regions could have participated in the clashes.

"One of the detainees is charged under Article 345 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (threat or violence against a law enforcement officer). Today, a preventive measure will be chosen for him by the court. We demand that this measure be detention," Varchenko said.
