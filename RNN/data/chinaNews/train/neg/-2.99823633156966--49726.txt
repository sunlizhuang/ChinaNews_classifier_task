An Australian couple have been left in limbo on a cruise ship after the vessel was banned from its planned journey to the Philippines over coronavirus fears.

The Holland America cruise liner left Hong Kong on Saturday but David and Judy Holst, from Adelaide, said the captain then informed them about a day into the trip to Manila the ship would not be allowed to dock there.

Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte extended the country's travel ban on Sunday to anyone coming directly from Hong Kong, China and Macau in the past two weeks.

It came as the Philippines confirmed a man in the country had died from the deadly virus on Sunday and the number of people who had died in the outbreak surpassed 300.

Mr Holst, who was about midway through a month-long cruise on the Westerdam ship across Asia, said the decision to stop in Hong Kong was 'dumb'.

He said about 800 passengers joined the cruise in Hong Kong, bringing the total number of passengers to 2,000.

'My wife and I were at dinner and I said "the boat's slowed down",' Mr Holst told ABC Radio Adelaide.

'A little while later an announcement came over the PA saying Manila has denied us entry.'

The disability advocate said he had been told to 'be quiet and go away' when he went to guest services to question the decision to stop in Hong Kong.

On Monday, Mr Holst said the cruise ship had then been refused entry to Hualien in northern Taiwan and would instead go to Kaohsiung in the island's south on Tuesday.

'Holland America brought this on when they recklessly went to Hong Kong,' Mr Holst said in a Facebook post.

'The captain in his broadcast said he hopes we are all feeling grateful for the huge effort of Holland America to find us port docks? OMG.'

Holland America said the Holst's cruise would dock in Hong Kong but end in Japan and not Shanghai on the Chinese mainland in a January 28 update.

In a separate update, the cruise provider said from February 15 none of their cruises would stop in Hong Kong.

In a statement provided to Daily Mail Australia, Holland America said they were closely monitoring the evolving coronavirus situation.

They said measures being implemented included pre-boarding medical evaluations and coronavirus medical screenings for all guests who report to their onboard medical centre with symptoms of respiratory illness.

For those who had to change their flights as a result of the change to Japan as the cruise's end point, a spokesperson said a $250 airline change fee would be covered by Holland America.

'Our medical experts are coordinating closely with the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to implement enhanced screening, prevention and control measures for our ships globally,' the spokesperson said.

It comes as Japan's government said on Monday it would quarantine a Yokohama-bound cruise ship, after a Hong Kong man who sailed on it last month tested positive for coronavirus.

The 80-year-old man flew to Japan and boarded the Diamond Princess, run by Carnival Japan Inc, in Yokohama on January 20 and disembarked on January 25, NHK public broadcaster said.
