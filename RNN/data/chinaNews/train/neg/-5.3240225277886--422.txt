The United States firmly denied it is pulling troops out of Iraq in the wake of the assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani.

US Defence Secretary Mark Esper told Sky News they have no plans to leave and instead are repositioning troops and scaling back operations in Baghdad.

This after a letter was seen by Reuters, from United States Marine Corps Brigadier General William H. Seely III, the commanding general of Task Force Iraq, addressed to the Iraqi defence ministry’s Combined Joint Operations Baghdad.

It read: “Sir, in deference to the sovereignty of the Republic of Iraq, and as requested by the Iraqi Parliament and the Prime Minister, CJTF-OIR will be repositioning forces over the course of the coming days and weeks to prepare for onward movement."

Earlier today NATO and European leaders condemned Iran's "negative" role in the Middle East while calling for a "de-escalation" of tension on a day of developments following the killing of General Qassem Soleimani.

The fall-out from the US airstrike ordered by President Trump has continued today as Iran's supreme leader wept over Soleimani's coffin and millions of mourners flooded the streets of Tehran demanding retaliation.

Meanwhile Downing Street has sought to distance itself from Trump's threat that Iranian cultural sites could be targeted amid heightening tensions in the Persian Gulf.

Iran has warned that revenge will be “severe” and “soon”.
