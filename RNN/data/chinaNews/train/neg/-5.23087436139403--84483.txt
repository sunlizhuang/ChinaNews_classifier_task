Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, Hubei province.

Wuhan the center of the raging coronvairus epidemic in China, withdrew an earlier order to allow non-residents to leave if they do not show no symptoms and have never had contact with patients.

About 2,700 Hong Kong residents have been pleading for nealry a month for help to leave the virus-ravaged Chinese provincial city.

Local authorities said today they did not have the consent of the headquarters and the major leaders and the decision allowing non-locals to leave is invalid, CGTN reports.

The local authorities seriously criticized the relevant personnel and said Wuhan will adhere to strictly managing the passage from the city, controling personnel in and out of Wuhan, and preventing the spread of the epidemic.

Wuhan, home to over 11 million people and capital city of central China's Hubei Province, locked the city down on the morning of January 23.
