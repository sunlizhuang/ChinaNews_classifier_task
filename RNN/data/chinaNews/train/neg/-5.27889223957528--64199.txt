London base metals mostly rose on Monday on fears of a supply disruption in China, where a coronavirus outbreak has killed over 900 people and threatened to impact global growth.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) rose 0.6% to $5,695 a tonne by 0421 GMT, nickel advanced 1.8% to $12,995 a tonne, zinc increased 1.4% to $2,174 a tonne, tin jumped 2% to $16,500 a tonne, while aluminum eased 0.1% to $1,724 a tonne.

China’s nonferrous metal output will fall at least 10% year-on-year in February, as the country battles the virus outbreak but operations are expected to normalize after the second quarter, the country’s metal association said.

“Before the price consolidation, the main concern was demand destruction due to China’s economic slowdown and lockdown, but as the situation develops, it seems that supply is also disrupted,” said analyst Helen Lau of Argonaut Securities.

“Prices might weaken going forward but not too much,” Lau said.
