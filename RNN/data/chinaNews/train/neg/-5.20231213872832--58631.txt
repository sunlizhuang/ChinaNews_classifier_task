None of the evacuees from China who arrived at San Antonio’s Lackland Air Force Base are sick, according to an official with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The passengers were men, women and children and had either been living in, or traveled to, Hubei province. They were escorted off the plane, at which time medical professionals took their temperatures. Some of the passengers were then loaded back onto the plane and will continue on to Omaha, Nebraska. Fewer than 100 of the passengers will be kept at the air force base.

All the evacuees will be under federal quarantined for 14 days from the time the plane left China.

“It may seem surprising to some that we are taking such aggressive measures,” CDC's Capt. Jennifer McQuiston said at a news conference Friday.

McQuiston added that the goal of the CDC is to protect the health of US citizens.
