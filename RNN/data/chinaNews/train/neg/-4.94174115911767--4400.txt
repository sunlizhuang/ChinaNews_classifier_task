A new strain of coronavirus may be the culprit in a mysterious pneumonia outbreak that was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Chinese government said Thursday. The first suspected case occurred in Korea on Wednesday.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which claimed the lives of 37 people here in 2015, is also a viral disease caused by coronavirus.

But China's official CCTV quoted a scientist as saying a new type of coronavirus is probably responsible since it was found in 15 patients in a preliminary analysis he participated in. So far 59 patients have been diagnosed in China alone with viral pneumonia.

Coronavirus is a common type that causes colds and infects both humans and animals. Six strains have been identified so far as sources of human diseases including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and MERS. The other four are not fatal but cause only mild colds.
