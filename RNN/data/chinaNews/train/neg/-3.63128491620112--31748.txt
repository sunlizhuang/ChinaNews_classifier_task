Federal authorities on Tuesday discussed three cases in which researchers affiliated with Boston-area institutions are accused of trying to provide clandestine scientific aid to the People's Republic of China. "This is a small sample of China's ongoing campaign to siphon off American technology and know-how for Chinese gain," U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said during a press conference at the Moakley Federal Courthouse.Although otherwise unrelated, each of the cases involves a scientist accused of hiding their affiliation with Chinese institutions. Dr. Charles LieberThe chairman of the chemistry department at Harvard University, Dr. Charles Lieber, 60, is accused of lying to federal authorities about his ties to China and was arrested Tuesday, officials announced. According to a criminal complaint, Lieber did not disclose that he was being paid a salary of up to $50,000 per month and up to $158,000 per year in living expenses by China's Thousand Talents Plan and the Wuhan University of Technology. Federal investigators also determined that Lieber was awarded more than $1.5 million to establish a nanotechnology research lab at WUT."China's Thousand Talents Plan, according to the complaint (is) a Chinese government-run program designed to entice scientists and researchers in the United States to share their research expertise with China," said Lelling. Lieber is accused of making false statements about his connections to China on National Institutes of Health grant applications. Lelling said those programs required Lieber to disclose if he was working with any foreign power. “The charges brought by the U.S. government against Professor Lieber are extremely serious. Harvard is cooperating with federal authorities, including the National Institutes of Health, and is conducting its own review of the alleged misconduct," a Harvard spokesperson said. "Professor Lieber has been placed on indefinite administrative leave.”Lieber is due back in court Thursday and remains in custody. He could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted on the charges he is facing.Yanqing YeAnother case announced Tuesday involves a Boston University researcher who is accused of failing to disclose her status as a lieutenant in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. According to the indictment, Yanqing Ye, 29, was taking orders from PLA superiors while conducting her research at BU. She was indicted Tuesday by a federal grand jury, Lelling said. Ye's research and studies in the U.S. were funded by the Chinese Scholarship Council, the indictment said. She was granted a J-1 non-immigrant visa in 2017 to conduct research at BU's Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering's Center for Polymer Studies. "The indictment alleges that a colonel from the PLA and other military officers from the Chinese National University of Defense Technology gave Ye numerous assignments while she was in the United States, such as conducting research, assessing U.S. military websites and sending documents and information back to China," Lelling said. In her application for that visa, federal authorities said she lied about the end of her foreign military service and rank. Ye faces charges including conspiracy, acting as an agent of a foreign government and visa fraud. "Ms. Ye left Boston University in April, 2019. We look forward to assisting the U.S. Attorney’s Office as it continues its investigation," said a Boston University spokesperson. Lelling said a border search of Ye's electronic devices also uncovered dossiers she had compiled about two U.S. residents with expertise in robotics and computer science. Zaosong ZhengThe third case discussed Tuesday is that of Zaosong Zheng, 30, a cancer researcher at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, who is accused of trying to smuggling vials of cancer cells on a flight from Boston to Beijing on Dec. 10."Before he boarded his flight, customs officers discovered 21 vials of biological material in a sock in his baggage," Lelling said. "When confronted by the officers, Zheng initially lied." Later, officials said, Zheng admitted to stealing the vials from Beth Israel and said he planned to bring the vials to China in order to conduct research in his own lab and publish the results under his own name."We are deeply proud of the breadth and depth of our research programs. Any efforts to compromise research undermine the hard work of our faculty and staff to advance patient care," said a BIDMC spokesperson. "We are grateful for the diligence and professionalism of federal law enforcement in this case and are fully cooperating with the government’s ongoing investigation of this matter."
