A second plane carrying 11 people evacuated from coronavirus-hit China touched down in the UK last night.

The flight landed at RAF Norton in Oxfordshire and was carrying a group of British nationals and their relatives.

Evacuees will join 83 other people who have been quarantined at special unit Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral, Merseyside.

The group secured seats on a French flight leaving Beijing and will spend 14 days in quarantine.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab confirmed the flight was expected back.

He said: "It's correct that there is a further French flight that is expected back in Europe today and that will carry some UK nationals."

Pictures taken at the base show passengers wearing face masks disembarking the jet.

The identity of the 11 individuals has not been released but one of the passengers appears to be a baby who was being carried in a cot by a man.

It comes as the deadly disease overtook the 2003 SARS - severe acute respiratory syndrome - epidemic death toll.

More than 360 people have died of the disease in China with the total number of cases in-country stood at 17,205.

The first person to die outside mainland China was confirmed yesterday, as a man in the Philippines lost his life.

Last week, British authorities confirmed two family members tested positive for the coronavirus in England.

The diagnosis follows extensive testing by government officials who have said over 200 people have been tested for the deadly disease.
