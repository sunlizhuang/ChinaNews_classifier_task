At least 20,000 people have been infected by the Wuhan coronavirus worldwide, and 427 people have died.

In just a matter of weeks, the virus has spread from an initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, to 25 other countries, and has resulted in the quarantine of at least 16 Chinese cities.

Chinese authorities are scrambling to contain the virus and treat an influx of new patients, but a reported lack of medical tests and protective gear are making matters difficult.

From putting cities on lockdown to panic-building new hospitals, here’s what it looks like in China amid the coronavirus outbreak.

The first case of the coronavirus was reported in Wuhan in December, and is thought to have originated at the Huanan Seafood Market, a wet market that sold live animals next to seafood and meat.

Chinese authorities began an official investigation into the disease in early January, after fear began spreading that this could be like SARS, another coronavirus that originated in China and killed 774 people in the early 2000s.

After the initial outbreak, people began wearing masks to protect themselves from the virus — even though, for the average person, wearing a mask is not as effective as hand-washing and avoiding infected people to keep from getting the illness.

When it became known that the virus could spread from human to human contact, China imposed screening precautions in Wuhan and began checking people for the virus at transportation hubs.
