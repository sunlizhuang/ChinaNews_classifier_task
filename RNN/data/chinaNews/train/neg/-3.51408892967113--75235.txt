Mainland China reported 1,886 new coronavirus cases and 98 more deaths for a total of 1,868 in its update today, following a report that 80 percent of cases have been mild, prompting guarded optimism from health officials.

China has so far not provided a detailed breakdown of who has died, children, men, women, elderly, or disabled.

The latest figures come after health officials in China published the first details on nearly 45,000 cases of infection with the coronavirus that originated there, saying more than 80 percent have been mild and new ones seem to be falling since early this month.

A total of 72,436 cases have been reported in mainland China as of today, although a rise in recent cases was due to a broader definition in the hardest-hit region based on doctors’ diagnoses before laboratory tests were completed.

Monday’s report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention gives the World Health Organization a “clearer picture of the outbreak, how it’s developing and where it’s headed,” WHO’s director-general said at a news conference.

“It’s too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
