The CDC confirmed the first U.S. case of the virus Tuesday.

Passengers at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and Chicago O'Hare International Airport will be screened. Officials have screened around 1,000 travelers at three U.S. airports: New York's JFK Airport, San Francisco International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport, the CDC said in a briefing Tuesday.

What's more, officials will begin forcing all passengers that originate in outbreak city Wuhan, China, to go to one of those five airports if they wish to enter the U.S.
