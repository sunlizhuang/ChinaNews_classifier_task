Oil prices recovered from their lowest level in more than a year and equities rebounded yesterday amid hopes that the coronavirus outbreak is peaking.

The rise in markets came as China’s senior medical adviser indicated that the spread of the virus could be contained by April.

Zhong Nanshan, an epidemiologist who was at the forefront of efforts to combat Sars in 2003, said: “I hope this outbreak or this event may be over in something like April.” He said that the outbreak was most likely to peak this month before easing.

Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, also emphasised that the virus was containable. “We have stress-tested the UK system and particularly the UK banks to something much greater than that,” he said.
