Travellers arriving in Indonesia from the Chinese city of Wuhan have been sprayed down by officials wearing hazmat suits.

On Sunday (local time), more than 200 Indonesian citizens were evacuated from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, and taken to a facility in Natuna where they are to spend two weeks in quarantine.

Upon arrival in Batam, in the Riau Islands, the passengers - 237 Indonesian citizens, one foreigner and five officials from the Foreign Ministry - were sprayed with disinfectant, reported the Jakarta Post.

Video posted to Twitter appears to show the passengers getting the spray down and, according to the Jakarta Post, no one on the flight was found to have the virus.

As well as bringing home its own nationals, Indonesia joined several other countries - including New Zealand - in placing a temporary ban on travellers arriving from mainland China, in a bid to stop the spread of the virus.

The New Zealand Government has also made plans to evacuate Kiwis from Wuhan, with an Air New Zealand flight departing for China on Monday evening. Following a stopover in Hong Kong, where it will pick up cabin crew, it will head to Wuhan and then return to New Zealand on Wednesday afternoon.

Around 70 Kiwis will be on the flight, with those evacuated to be taken to a military facility at Whangaparaoa where they will be quarantined for 14 days.

Also on board will be citizens from Australia and countries in the Pacific Islands.

The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) were organising pre-flight screening for the passengers to make sure they were not showing any symptom of the virus, RNZ reported.
