"JNU is known as a very peaceful campus. We always debate and discuss and resolve issues. Violence is never an answer for any grievances. It is very very unfortunate that such a violent incident took place in our campus," JNU VC M Jagadesh Kumar told ANI.

"Around 4:30 pm (on 5th Jan) we came to know that a group of students was moving aggressively towards the hostel area. Then we sent our security guards to assess & control the situation, but more students gathered. Immediately, the police was contacted. The situation was contained," he further added.

" There were rumours that some wardens resigned. Our wardens haven't resigned. There is no such resignation that have taken place. Some protesting students surrounded our wardens, shouted on them&humiliated them. Is it way to have any dialogue?," Kumar said.
