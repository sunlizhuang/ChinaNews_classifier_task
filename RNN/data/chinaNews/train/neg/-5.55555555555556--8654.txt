An 8-year-old boy was recently hospitalized after he threw a firecracker down a manhole in China.

A parking lot surveillance camera captured the child launching up into the air after he is seen inserting the firecracker into a manhole in the Gansu city of Dunhuang. His friend can also be seen fleeing to safety as the boy dropped the explosive.

The cover exploded shortly after and it was sent flying for several seconds.

The boy, who was carried by the blast’s powerful force, was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment, Shanghaiist reports.

This stunt appears to be a recurring incident around Chinese New Year as it was just last year when another 8-year-old boy set off a similar explosion.

Back in January 2019, a boy from the Inner Mongolian city of Chifeng also dropped fireworks into a manhole, destroying a large part of the sidewalk and sending bricks flying toward parked vehicles.
