Irish oil and gas explorer Providence Resources has offered its new CEO, Alan Linn, the option of buying shares in the group at a price of four cent, subject to shareholder approval.

The company has agreed to award Mr Linn 15,000,000 options over ordinary shares, equaling a value of £600,000 (€701,182).

The options will be issued under the Providence Resources Employee Share Option Plan 2020, which is being established.

The award is conditional on the approval of shareholders at a forthcoming Extraordinary General Meeting of the company to be convened.

The options will vest in three equal tranches on each of the first, second and third anniversary of the grant date with an exercise price of four pence per share.

Providence last week appointed Alan Linn as its new CEO.

He replaces Tony O'Reilly Jnr, who stepped down in December after funding of $9m (€8m) from Chinese group Apec failed to materialise.

Mr Linn has over 35 years of oil and gas industry experience. Having established his career in the UK, he subsequently worked internationally with Lasmo, Cairn Energy, Tullow Oil, Roc Oil, and with Afren as part of a restructuring process.

He joins Providence from Third Energy Onshore, where he was CEO.
