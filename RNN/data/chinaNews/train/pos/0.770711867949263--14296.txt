BERLIN, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping's special envoy Yang Jiechi called here on Sunday for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire in Libya.

Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, made the appeal at the Berlin Conference on Libya.

Yang said that effort to address the Libyan issue should focus on the fundamental interests of the Libyan people and the future and destiny of the North African country.

All parties concerned should restart dialogue and reconciliation as soon as possible, he added.

Yang also called for effectively and appropriately resolving differences in a bid to achieve regional peace and stability. The spillover effects of the Libyan conflict should also be eliminated through a comprehensive approach that addresses both symptoms and root causes, he said.

China always takes an objective and fair stand on the Libyan issue, abides by the purposes and principle of the UN Charter, always respects Libya's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and insists on promoting the political settlement of the Libyan issue under the UN leadership, Yang said.

China is willing to continue to work with the international community to positively contribute to restoring peace, stability and development in Libya, Yang said.
