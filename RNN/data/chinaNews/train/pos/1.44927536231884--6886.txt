The Port of Immingham has received six electric rubber-tyred gantry (E-RTG) cranes, as part of a project to expand its container terminal.

Project Pilgrim is a £33m (US$43m) upgrade to Immingham Container Terminal to future proof the terminal, extend its footprint and improve the service to customers.

In particular, it aims to increase the space, improve the layout and add new equipment at the facility.

The E-RTGs, which took 34 days to travel from China to the UK port, make up over £7m (US$9m) of the total investment.

The cranes will now go through some several stages on the port, including modification works and mapping, ready to be commissioned for work at the end of February.

Simon Bird, regional director of ABP Humber, said: “The investment in this infrastructure is key to ABP’s expansion plans at the Humber Container Terminal on the Port of Immingham and we have already seen huge success from similar investment in our port across the Humber in Hull.

“The electric rubber tyre gantry cranes will also reduce fuel consumption by 95% and will therefore complement our efforts to reduce emissions.”

ABP is looking to boost competitiveness at its Humber Ports facilities, which include the four ports of Grimsby, Immingham, Hull and Goole.

In 2018, the container terminal in Hull expanded which saw sailings increase from five to 15 per week, adding new destinations as partners.

The operator hopes that by investing in the terminals in Hull and Immingham, it can help Humber Ports become a significant hub for short sea containers in the UK market.
