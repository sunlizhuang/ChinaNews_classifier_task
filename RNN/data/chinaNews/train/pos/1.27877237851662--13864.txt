In just a few weeks, Top Gear will be back on British TV screens for a brand-new series. The first trailer for Top Gear season 28 was released earlier this month, and now, as the start date gets closer, a new video gives us an extended look at the new season's star cars we'll get to see being put through their paces around the Top Gear test track by Chris Harris, who will once again be showing off his sideways driving skills. Judging from this lineup, Top Gear season 28 is going to be a treat for gearheads.



The trailer opens with Harris taming the insanely fast Volkswagen ID.R race car, which smashed lap records at the Nurburgring, Pikes Peak, and Heavens Gate in China. Continuing the electric car theme, Harris gets tail-happy in a Porsche Taycan Turbo S.
