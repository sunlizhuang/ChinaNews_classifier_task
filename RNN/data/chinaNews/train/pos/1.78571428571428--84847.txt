Chevrolet Thailand said its after- sale services will continue at Chevrolet service centres nationwide after the brand's withdrawal from the Thai market at end of this year.

General Motors announced on February 17 that it had signed a binding term sheet with Great Wall Motors on the sale of GM’s Rayong vehicle manufacturing facility, and would withdraw Chevrolet from Thailand.

GM Thailand’s Director General Vanchana Unakul said GM Thailand has a large inventory of genuine parts for repairs and maintenance service of old and new Chevrolet models.

“I and the after-sale team will continue to take care of our customers ” he added.
