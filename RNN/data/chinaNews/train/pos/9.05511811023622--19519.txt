KOTA KINABALU: Elderly folks from two homes were given an early Chinese New Year treat during visits by Petronas staff and volunteers recently.

Residents of the Old Folks Home in Likas and Bethany Home in Luyang were given "ang pow" (red packets), treated to lion dance performances and had get-together sessions with other residents and volunteers.

The programmes organised by Petronas’ corporate social responsibility arm - Yayasan Petronas - also saw the homes receive basic food items, waterproof mattresses, table fans and oblong tables.

Volunteers helped with cleaning up the two homes and put up Chinese New Year decorations to give the 55 residents a feel of festivity.

Petronas Sabah and Labuan head Rokiah Sulaiman said through this Sentuhan Kasih Yayasan Petronas, they hope to spread joy during the festive season as well as nurture and enhance the spirit of giving and volunteerism among employees.

Chua Boon Kian, 69, a retired salesman living in one of the homes, thanked the volunteers for visiting them.

“I’m looking forward to celebrating the coming Chinese New Year, ” he said.

Grace Old Folks Home manager Alex Tham Vun Chung said they appreciated individuals and organisations taking the effort to visit them.

“It helps bring up the festive mood and make the celebration more meaningful, ” he said.

Apart from these two homes, Petronas volunteers also visited Hospital Mesra Bukit Padang and contributed exercise equipment.

These included 20 yoga mats and two stationary bicycles which are among the items required by the hospital.
