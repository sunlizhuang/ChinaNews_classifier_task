Chinese private equity fund manager Tsing-Yuan Capital has closed two RMB-denominated funds to expand its capital pool of over 7 billion yuan ($1.01 billion) for investment opportunities in China.

Tsing-Yuan Capital did not disclose the size of the investment vehicles in a statement released on its WeChat official account on Friday. But the company said that one of the funds was jointly launched by Tsing-Yuan Capital and Eastelsoft, a Chinese internet of things (IoT) solutions provider listed on the New Third Board, an over-the-counter trading system in China.

The joint fund received capital injections from market-oriented capital, as well as government support including a district government in eastern Chinaâ€™s Suzhou city and a fund led by the Suzhou Science and Technology Bureau, the local authority responsible for technology and patent-related affairs. It will primarily invest in startups in the fields of clean technologies, intelligent manufacturing, IT and healthcare, according to the statement.

The second fund, in comparison, will operate as a privately-run venture capital fund for investment opportunities in emerging industries like healthcare, advanced manufacturing, and new-generation IT.

Founded in 2011 with close ties to Chinese academic institution Tsinghua University, Tsing-Yuan Capital had over 7 billion yuan ($1.01 billion) in total assets under management (AUM) and more than 200 portfolio firm, shows the company website. The company claims to have existed from about 100 investments, including 17 IPOs, with an average internal rate of return of more than 30 per cent.

Shenzhen-based Tsing-Yuan Capital went public on the New Third Board in December 2015.
