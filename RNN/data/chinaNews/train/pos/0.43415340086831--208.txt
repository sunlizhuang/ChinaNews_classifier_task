That 2019 was a tough year for car makers is no real secret. Months of consecutive declines conspired to produce a less than stellar sales result in Australia, with the 1,062,867 vehicles sold down 7.8 per cent on 2018’s numbers, and marking the lowest annual tally since 2011.

But that’s not to say there weren’t bright spots, with several brands managing to buck the national trend, selling more cars in 2019 than they did last year.

To qualify for this list, a brand must have sold more than 200 vehicles, and has to have been in full operation for two consecutive years (otherwise the numbers are too wildly skewed).

Now, we must clarify that this list is not the highest-selling brands, nor is it a list of everyone who recorded a positive result, this is simply the brands who secured the biggest year-on-year increase, regardless of the actual number of sales.

So without further ado, here are the brands defying the market downturn in Australia.

SsangYong, 1040 sales, up more than 999 per cent

SsangYong is the definition of “from a low base”. The Korean company returned very late in 2018 with just 3 sales registered, while 2019 saw 1040 registrations across the company’s range of models.

It’s hitting the market where it wants it: the Musso ute accounted for more than half of the company’s tally (545 sales), while the Rexton also performed well (213 sales). The all-new Korando mid-size SUV should help the company push for even higher sales in 2020, after recording 44 units sold in its first month.

Genesis, 103 sales, up 442.1 per cent

Don’t get too excited about that huge percentage gain. Genesis only sold 103 vehicles in 2019, compared with a measly tally of just 19 units in 2018.

This new brand is still finding its feet in the Aussie market, though, and we expect to see even bigger tallies in 2020 with the introduction of the GV80 SUV expected later in the year.

As it stands, though, the sporty G70 model has struck a chord with customers, outselling the bigger (and older) G80 in 2019.

Ram, 2868 sales, up 296.7 per cent

Ram’s successful assault on the big truck market continues apace, with the Ram 1500 especially defying all expectations to shift a mammoth 2609 units in 2019. The 2500 and 3500 contributed only 259 sales to the brand’s annual total, so it’s pretty clear the 1500 is the right size for our market. Watch this space for several new competitors to enter the fray over the next 12 months or so.

MG, 8326 sales, up 176.9 per cent

The Chinese brand is booming in Australia, shifting 8326 units last year, up a staggering 176.9 on its 2018 numbers. The MG3 took the lion’s share, with 4017 sales, with the MG ZS close behind with 3729 sales.

Haval, 1706 sales, up 169.5 per cent

Havel might largely be an unknown in parts of Australia, but the brand has been diligently making in-roads into our competitive new-car market all year.

The brand shifted a total 1706 cars last year, led largely by the H2, which moved 918 units, with the H6 (475) and the H9 (312) contributing, too.

Great Wall, 1401 sales, up 78.7 per cent

Yet another budget-friendly Chinese brand makes the list here, with Great Wall almost doubling its annual sales to 1401 units. That’s an increase of 78.7 per cent, and it was unsurprisingly led by the brand’s single model, the Great Wall Steed.

Great Wall shifted 891 two-wheel-drive models, and a further 510 four-wheel drives last year.

Rolls-Royce, 55 sales, up 37.5 per cent

Rolls-Royce must be thinking “Why didn’t we do this sooner!?”

That’s because 2019 saw the introduction of the Cullinan SUV, which helped add a not-unsubstantial 19 sales to its tally of 55 for the year. That’s not bad, especially considering this circa-$700K SUV is the most expensive high-rider on the market!

Skoda, 7001 sales, up 20.6 per cent

Skoda is the unfairly forgotten member of the VW group in Australia, but the brand has had a killer 2019, with sales up more than 20 per cent to 7001 units, around 1500 more than it managed in 2018.

Leading the charge was the very good Kodiaq, but the Octavia and Karoq weren’t far behind. Expect big things from Skoda in 2020.

Time for some honourable mentions

We start with Volvo, who's 2019 to remember continued in December, with the brand reporting an annual sales bump of 16.2 per cent compared to its 2018 numbers.

Lexus managed to increase its annual sales by nine per cent, while LDV managed 6.9 per cent. Porsche delivered 6.4 per cent more vehicles in 2019 than in 2018, while Kia continues to slay, remaining on the few major brands that reported a full year of month-on-month growth to finish 2019 up 4.6 per cent.
