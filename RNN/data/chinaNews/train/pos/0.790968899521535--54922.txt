OMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) -- Several planes originating in China are headed to three U.S. airports, including Eppley Airfield this week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control confirmed Wednesday morning.

According to the news release, the flights will be met by a team from the CDC, who will assess the health of the passengers as cases of coronavirus rise in China.

"The passengers have been screened, monitored, and evaluated by medical and public health personnel every step of the way, including before takeoff and during, the flight," the release states.

In the interest of protecting the public's health, the passengers will be given legal orders for a two-week quarantine beginning the day their flight leaves Wuhan, China, the release states.

6 News confirmed Tuesday that the 70 people arriving in Omaha will be quarantined at Camp Ashland.

Other flights from China are bound for Travis Air Force Base in Sacramento, Calif.; and Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, the release states.

The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services and local agencies are also assisting in the process.

The Iowa Department of Public Health has also increased surveillance and screening for those who may be vulnerable.

According to a release, the enhanced level of surveillance has identified two Iowans that have returned from China that are currently undergoing testing for the virus. They are under voluntary home confinement.

Testing by the CDC will reveal results in several days, according to the release.
