She continued: "Everyone has been very kind and I’m glad viewers get to see that I am actually very kind."

Talking about visiting the Corrie set, Sian said: "It was quite nostalgic going there because I’ve watched it since I was little."

She continued: "I got my friends to take me to the set first before I started filming so I didn’t get too emotional."

Lorraine then aired a clip of Friday night's instalment of Coronation Street.

In the clip, Tim panics as he discovers Charlie is yet to leave Weatherfield despite him paying her off.

Tim bumps into Charlie as he nips into the Rovers Return, and is left stunned to see her behind the bar.

Tim worriedly asks: "What are you doing here?"

"I thought you were talking to the solicitors?," he added.

"Well, I was but then I saw the advert in the café for bar staff."

"But I gave you the money," Tim reasoned.

Charlie replies: "I know, but you said it was really aged to get a job round here and I have."

Corrie continues tonight at 7.30pm on ITV
