Over the past few months, brown sugar boba ice cream bars have flown off shelves and people have inundated social media with posts desperately searching for the coveted treats. I joined the hunt in December and reached out to friends on Twitter and WeChat, asking where in Chicago I could get my hands on a box. Many of them claimed Chinatown markets were the place to go, but after three months of looking, I remained empty-handed. So when I stopped in at the H Mart location downtown last weekend and saw that the store had clearly just restocked the coveted item, I stood in shock in front of the freezer case, slack-jawed at my luck, before hastily buying a box.
