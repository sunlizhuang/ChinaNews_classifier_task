MG Motor India has already teased its next offering for India. The Chinese-owned brand will showcase the Indian version of the Maxus D90 SUV. This vehicle is sold under different SAIC brands globally like Maxus and LDV, but its Indian version will be called the MG Gloster.

This is the same strategy that the British brand follows for the Hector. This SUV is sold under many different brands and nameplates globally. It's called the Baojun 530 in China, Wuling Almaz in Indonesia and the Chevrolet Captiva in Thailand.

With the teaser, MG Motor has also released many other details of the D90. It measures 5,005mm in length, 1,932mm in width and 1,875mm in height. Also, the wheelbase measures 2,950mm. The suspension set-up in the India-spec MG Maxus D90 includes dual helix independent in the front and 5-link integral in the rear. In terms of safety, the Maxus D90 has been awarded a 5-star rating in the Australia NCAP crash tests wherein 70 per cent of the body is made of steel and nine per cent is made of thermoformed steel with a strength of 1,500Mpa. We also expect this SUV to come with numerous segment-first features, given that this is a strategy MG has used to gain popularity in our market. We think the D90 could come with features like a 360-degree camera, TPMS, sunroof, dual-zone air-conditioning, an eight-way power-adjustable driver seat, a 12-inch touchscreen infotainment system, a panoramic sunroof, connected car tech, six airbags, hill descent control and so on.

A 2.0-litre turbo petrol with 225PS and 350Nm is offered elsewhere with the D90 but we think MG will bring it to India with a new diesel engine. This is expected to be an in-house developed unit derived from the FCA Multijet diesel as seen on the Hector. This motor will put out 218PS and 480Nm and come paired with an 8-speed automatic. The Gloster will come in six (2+2+2) and seven (2+3+2) seater options and ride on 255/55 R19 and segment-leading 265/45 R21 tyres.

The MG Gloster will be priced aggressively around Rs 40-45 lakh. The Gloster will compete with the likes of the Alturas G4, Toyota Fortuner and Ford Endeavour but match much more premium cars like the Land Cruiser Prado and Jeep Grand Cherokee in terms of features and performance.
