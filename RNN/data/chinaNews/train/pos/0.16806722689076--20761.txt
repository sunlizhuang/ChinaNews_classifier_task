Donald Trump will make one final bid to persuade Boris Johnson to ban Huawei from Britain’s 5G network this weekend when he sends one of his most senior ministers to London.

With a decision on Huawei expected early next week, Steven Mnuchin, the US Treasury Secretary, will lay out President Trump’s concerns in a meeting with his counterpart Sajid Javid.

It comes after senior civil servants recommended that the Chinese telecoms giant be allowed to bid for “non-core” elements of the mobile phone network.

President Trump is concerned that Huawei equipment could be used for espionage, as the Chinese government can require private companies to spy on its behalf.

There have been growing signs that Mr Johnson will not ban Huawei, though Downing Street has insisted no decision has yet been made.

The US has suggested its intelligence-sharing relationship with Britain could be affected by Huawei being part of the 5G network, and Mr Mnuchin will ram home the point in his meeting with Mr Javid.
