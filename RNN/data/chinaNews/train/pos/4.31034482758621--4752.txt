There's a brand-new sushi bar in town. Called Sizka Restaurant, the fresh addition is located at 1030 S. Linwood Ave. in Canton.

Sizka Restaurant, a Japanese-fusion spot, serves up sushi and specialty entrées, with menu items ranging from pan-fried dumplings to bluefin tuna rolls to rib-eye steak. There's also dessert like black sesame or ginger ice cream.

The newcomer has gotten good reviews thus far, with a 3.5-star rating out of three reviews on Yelp.

Ryan M., who was among the first Yelpers to review the new spot on Jan. 4, wrote, "Kimchi dumplings were really good as well as the yellowtail scallion roll and the spicy salmon."

And Emily C. wrote, "The Ora King salmon appetizer was as fresh as you can get with a smooth rich flavor. Complimented nicely with mango, beet root and orange sauce. We tried a few different roles, including spicy tuna and salmon, shrimp tempura and Caribbean-style roll."

Head on over to check it out: Sizka Restaurant is open from 4 p.m.–10 p.m. on Monday-Thursday, 11:30 a.m.–11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday and 11:30 a.m.–10 p.m. on Sunday.
