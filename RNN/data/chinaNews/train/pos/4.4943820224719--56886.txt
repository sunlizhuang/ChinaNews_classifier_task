China has responded to the international community’s assistance amid the novel coronavirus outbreak, by saying that while China has “mostly relied on its own strength”, the help it has received enhances its international friendship.

“In the face of the epidemic, China mainly relies on its own strength to tackle the challenge. At the same time, we welcome and thank the sincere and friendly understanding, support and help from the international community,” China’s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a daily briefing on the ministry’s website.

She added that the governments of 21 countries and the United Nations children's agency UNICEF had donated epidemic prevention and control supplies to China as of Wednesday.

The countries are the Republic of Korea, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Hungary, Belarus, Turkey, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Egypt, Australia, New Zealand and Trinidad and Tobago.

“The donations speak volumes of their deep compassion. A friend in need is a friend indeed. I’d like to thank them all,” Hua added.

She went on to say that China would continue to share information and strengthen cooperation with other countries in an open, transparent and highly responsible manner to safeguard the life and health of the Chinese people and contribute to regional and global public health security.

The new coronavirus that appeared late December has claimed 563 lives, infected more than 28,000 people in mainland China and spread to more than 20 countries.
