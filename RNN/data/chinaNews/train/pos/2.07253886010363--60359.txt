MANILA - The top Chinese envoy in the Philippines on Thursday paid a courtesy visit to Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio and Vice Mayor Sebastian Duterte.

According to the Chinese embassy, Ambassador Huang Xilian briefed the top officials of Davao on China's fight against the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

Huang also assured them that "China will continue to share information with all other countries in an open and transparent manner and enhance cooperation to jointly uphold public health security in the region and the world," the embassy said.

He also praised the "sound momentum" of relations between the Philippines and China, and applauded Davao's progress under the leadership of Sara.

Mayor Sara Duterte meanwhile thanked China for its support for the development of Davao City over the years. She also expressed her confidence China will overcome the outbreak.

Last week, Huang said Beijing will give the "best care" for Filipinos staying in China amid the deadly outbreak, which killed more than 600 and infected more than 27,000 others.
