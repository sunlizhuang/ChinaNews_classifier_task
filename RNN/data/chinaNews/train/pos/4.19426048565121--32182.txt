Dear Friend of GATA and Gold:

In his latest essay, published tonight, Hugo Salinas Price, president of the Mexican Civic Association for Silver, scorns democracy and raises an uncomfortable question about it. That is, whose political system is superior -- "totalitarian" China's or "democratic" Germany's -- when Germany is impairing the ability of its people to own gold while China is strengthening it?

Salinas Price's essay is headlined "Some Thoughts on Democracy and China" and it's posted at the association's internet site, Plata.com.mx, here:
