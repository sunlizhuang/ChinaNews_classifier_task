A gala featuring performances by different ethnic groups in China will be aired on over 30 satellite TV channels during Spring Festival to celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year, which falls on Jan 25 this year.

One of the highlights at the gala held and filmed on Monday in Yinchuan, Ningxia Hui autonomous region, is a dance performed by people from the Dulong, De'ang and Jino ethnic groups of Yunnan province, in a bid to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China last year.

Other presentations of the culture of ethnic minorities include bamboo flute, drum and mouth harp performances.
