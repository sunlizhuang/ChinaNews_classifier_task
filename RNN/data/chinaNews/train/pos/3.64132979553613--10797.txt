LHASA, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- The Visit Nepal Year 2020 campaign formally kicked off Wednesday in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, with an appeal to Chinese travelers to visit the Himalayan country.

In 2020, the regional government will assist Nepal in organizing a series of promotional tourism events.

This will give a boost to Nepal's tourism industry, according to Gobinda Bahadur Karkee, the consul general of Nepal in Lhasa, at the opening ceremony of the campaign.

China is Nepal's second-largest source of tourists, with about 150,000 tourists visiting Nepal in 2018.

Tourism is one of the pillars of Nepal's economic development and the campaign held in China is expected to attract more Chinese visitors, Karkee said.

A total of 11 MoUs were signed at a recent meeting of the Nepal-China's Tibet Joint Tourism Coordinating Committee to enhance bilateral cooperation in the tourism sector.
