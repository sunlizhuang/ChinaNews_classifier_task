RASUWA, Jan 26: Rasuwa Customs Office has collected Rs 27.5 billion in revenue since the inception of its operation four years ago.

Punyo Bikram Khadka, chief customs officer at the customs office said that the transaction through the border point has been significantly increasing over the years. Rasuwagadhi border point officially came into operation after the Tatopani border point between Nepal and China located at Sindhupalchowk was shut down after the earthquake. The Tatopani border point has also resumed its operation but the business in Rasuwagadhi border point has not witnessed any significant decline.

The customs office had collected Rs 2.4 billion in the fiscal year 2015/16, Rs 2.92 billion in the FY 2016/17, Rs 4.59 billion in the FY 2017/18. Similarly, in the FY 2018/19, the office had collected Rs 10.60 billion in revenue.

Likewise, the customs office secured Rs 7.33 billion in revenue in the first six months of the current fiscal year 2019/20. Increase in import of goods, customs management, usage of technology in the office can be contributed for the increasing revenue collection trend, according to Khadka.

“The success of the customs office was possible due to the cooperation from all involved parties to operate the customs office in a managed way,” he said, “Lately, we have been prioritizing technology.”

The checking of import and export of products has been eased by the customs offices located in both Nepal and China. Drivers from outer districts have been provided with temporary passes. The customs office in the border point was established in 2013. Goods like readymade garments, apples, electronic goods, construction materials, footwear and other goods are being imported to Nepal from the border point. Whereas goods like bamboo stool, wooden goods, and handicrafts are being exported to China through the Rasuwa border point.
