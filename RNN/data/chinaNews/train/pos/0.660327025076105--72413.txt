If Joe Biden does somehow manage to win the nomination and the White House, one can only imagine what sort of incredible opportunities might await Hunter Biden in China. But if the subject is ever even mentioned on CNN or MSNBC, rest assured that these stories have all been completely debunked.

The article goes on to list numerous other Chinese state-owned firms that went on to invest tens of millions of dollars into Hunter Bidens firms. Its all so very convenient, not to mention highly profitable. And even today, while China is growing increasingly aggressive and militaristic in the South China sea, partnering with Russia and Iran, and oppressing the people of Hong Kong and Taiwan, Schweizer points out how Joe Biden remains very forgiving and friendly toward the Chinese. Just last week , the elder Biden is quoted as saying (of the Chinese), Come on, man. I mean, you know, theyre not bad folks, folks. But guess what, theyre not competition for us.

Hunters first trip to China to arrange these deals (along with Devon Archer) took place on the same day that Joe Biden was meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao in Washington. Coincidence? If you insist.

Rosemont Seneca was only one of a series of LLCs the three men launched, all of which wound up landing billions of dollars in deals with financial entities owned by the Chinese government. At the same time, their firms partnered up with Massachusetts-based Thornton Group, headed by James Bulger. To continue the name dropping game, James Bulger is the nephew of notorious mob hitman Whitey Bulger.

The really massive deal described in that excerpt above took place fairly early in Obama and Bidens second term, but Hunters history of cashing in started well before that. As Schweizer discovered through his research, shortly after Joe Biden was sworn in as Vice President, Hunter formed Rosemont Seneca Partners, an investment equity firm, with his partners Devon Archer and Chris Heinz. If the Heinz name rings a bell, thats because Chris is the stepson of John Kerry and his ketchup empire wife. (Funny how they all run in the same circles, eh?)

If that story sounds oddly familiar to you its not just your imagination. Hunter landed the Burisma deal despite having no background in the energy industry and he doesnt speak Ukranian. Similarly, he had virtually no experience in private equity markets or banking and he doesnt speak Chinese, but he somehow managed to nail down billions in business for his own, recently formed LLC that was created just for such opportunities.

If it sounds shocking that a vice president would shape US-China policy as his son  who has scant experience in private equity  clinched a coveted billion-dollar deal with an arm of the Chinese government, thats because it is.

In 2013, then-Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden flew aboard Air Force Two to China. Less than two weeks later, Hunter Bidens firm inked a $1 billion private equity deal with a subsidiary of the Chinese governments Bank of China. The deal was later expanded to $1.5 billion. In short, the Chinese government funded a business that it co-owned along with the son of a sitting vice president.

At the New York Post, theres a detailed breakdown of how Hunter Biden cashed in. Its written by Peter Schweizer, the author of Secret Empires , and the details paint a very troubling picture.

We already learned that a majority of Americans find Hunter Bidens sweetheart deal with Ukranian energy giant Burisma to be problematic at best. Despite nearly all of the mainstream media providing as much cover for the Bidens as possible, you have to wonder how everyone is feeling about the unfolding story of a very similar series of deals that the younger Biden landed in China. The closer you look at Hunters incredibly fortunate affairs in that nation, the worse it smells. And it also raises questions about Joe Bidens very friendly attitude toward an increasingly aggressive country thats rife with human rights abuses.

Just think,the left tried to kick the President out of office to protect the scum spawn of Joe Biden. I am positive that scum Hunter is only tipsy tops of the iceberg. The media and liberal sycophants ate the whole sh*t sandwich. The Ukraine thing was just convenient for the left as Russia never materialized. I have no doubt the scum left will keep trying to “impeach” over and over. Our system as designed is FUBAR even with POTUS Trump.

And nothing will ever be done - ever. Accusations fly, but as long as whomever is under the blanket protection of being a Dem, nothing will ever happen. It’s all just more Kabuki theater.

Designed this way or corrupted forever by Trumans National Security Act of 1947 and JFKs assassination on the street by our FBI / CIA and mob hitmen.

Hunter cashed in bigtime, conducted personal business traveling on AF Two.....and he did it all with govt resources. Even had a Chinese suckup hand-deliver a diamond to his hotel room......just to make sure corrupt Hunter "was bought good."

Neither is Hunter Biden a diplomat......sucked off taxpayers to enrich himself. Hunter Biden soaked the taxpayers using government-sponsored travel to conduct private business...flying on the tax-paid VP s plane ..Air Force Two

This pic is the epitome of Joe Biden's corruption. Shows exactly what he thinks of taxpaying Americans.We exist only to serve him and his greedy family's endless get-rich-quick schemes.

There are still wide swaths of documentation kept under wraps inside the State Dept that could

substantially alter the publics understanding of what happened in the Hunter Biden-Joe Biden-Obama-era Ukraine.

President Trump should ordered these released:

<><> Daily intelligence reports from March through August 2019 on Ukraines new president Volodymyr Zelensky and his relationship with oligarchs and other key figures. What was the CIA, FBI and U.S. Treasury Department telling Trump and other agencies about Zelenskys ties to oligarchs like Igor Kolomoisky, the former head of Privatbank, and any concerns the International Monetary Fund might have? Did any of these concerns reach the presidents daily brief (PDB) or come up in the debate around resolving Ukraine corruption and U.S. foreign aid? CNBC, Reuters and The Wall Street Journal all have done recent reporting suggesting there might have been intelligence and IMF concerns that have not been fully considered during the impeachment proceedings.

<><>State Department memos detailing conversations between former U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko. He says Yovanovitch raised the names of Ukrainians she did not want to see prosecuted during their first meeting in 2016. She calls Lutsenkos account fiction. But State Department officials admit the U.S. embassy in Kiev did pressure Ukrainian prosecutors not to target certain activists. Are there contemporaneous State Department memos detailing these conversations and might they illuminate the dispute between Lutsenko and Yovanovitch that has become key to the impeachment hearings?

<><>State Department memos on U.S. funding given to the George Soros-backed group the Anti-Corruption Action Centre. There is documentary evidence that State provided funding to this group, that Ukrainian prosecutor sought to investigate whether that aid was spent properly and that the U.S. embassy pressured Ukraine to stand down on that investigation. How much total did State give to this group? Why was a federal agency giving money to a Soros-backed group? What did taxpayers get for their money and were they any audits to ensure the money was spent properly? Were any of Ukrainian prosecutors concerns legitimate?

<><> Transcripts of Joe Bidens phone calls and meetings with Ukraines president and prime minister from April 2014 to January 2017 when Hunter Biden served on the board of the natural gas company Burisma Holdings. Did Burisma or Hunter Biden ever come up in the calls? What did Biden say when he urged Ukraine to fire the prosecutor overseeing an investigation of Burisma? Did any Ukrainian officials ever comment on Hunter Bidens role at the company? Was any official assessment done by U.S. agencies to justify Bidens threat of withholding $1 billion in U.S. aid if Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin wasnt fired?

<><> All documents from an Office of Special Counsel whistleblower investigation into unusual energy transactions in Ukraine. The U.S. governments main whistleblower office is investigating allegations from a U.S Energy Department worker of possible wrongdoing in U.S.-supported Ukrainian energy business. Who benefited in the United States and Ukraine from this alleged activity? Did Burisma gain any benefits from the conduct described by the whistleblower? OSC has concluded there is a substantial likelihood of wrongdoing involved in these activities.

<><>All FBI, CIA, Treasury Department and State Department documents concerning possible wrongdoing at Burisma Holdings. What did the U.S. know about allegations of corruption at the Ukrainian gas company and the efforts by the Ukrainian prosecutors to investigate? Did U.S., Latvian, Cypriot or European financial authorities flag any suspicious transactions involving Burisma or Americans during the time that Hunter Biden served on its board? Were any U.S. agencies monitoring, assisting or blocking the various investigations? When Ukraine reopened the Burisma investigations in March 2019, what did U.S. officials do?

<><> All documents from 2015-16 concerning the decision by the State Departments foreign aid funding arm, USAID, to pursue a joint project with Burisma Holdings. State official George Kent has testified he stopped this joint project because of concerns about Burismas corruption reputation.

Did Hunter Biden or his American business partner Devon Archer have anything to do with seeking the project? What caused its abrupt end? What issues did Kent identify as concerns and who did he alert in the White House, State or other agencies?

<><> All cables, memos and documents showing State Departments dealings with Burisma Holding representatives in 2015 and 2016. We now know that Ukrainian authorities escalated their investigation of Burisma Holdings in February 2016 by raiding the home of the companys owner, Mykola Zlochevsky. Soon after, Burismas American representatives were pressing the State Department to help end the corruption allegations against the gas firm, specifically invoking Hunter Bidens name. What did State officials do after being pressured by Burisma? Did the U.S. embassy in Kiev assist Burismas efforts to settle the corruption case against it? Who else in the U.S. government was being kept apprised?

<><> All contacts that the Energy Department, Justice Department or State Department had with Vice President Joe Bidens office concerning Burisma Holdings, Hunter Biden or business associate Devon Archer. We now know that multiple State Department officials believed Hunter Bidens association with Burisma created the appearance of a conflict of interest for the vice president, and at least one official tried to contact Joe Bidens office to raise those concerns. What, if anything, did these Cabinet agencies tell Joe Bidens office about the appearance concerns or the state of the various Ukrainian investigations into Burisma?

<><> All memos, emails and other documents concerning a possible U.S. embassys request in spring 2019 to monitor the social media activities and analytics of certain U.S. media personalities considered favorable to President Trump. Did any such monitoring occur? Was it requested by the American embassy in Kiev? Who ordered it? Why did it stop? Were any legal concerns raised?

<><> All State, CIA, FBI and DOJ documents concerning efforts by individual Ukrainian government officials to exert influence on the 2016 U.S. election, including an anti-Trump Op-Ed written in August 2016 by Ukraines ambassador to Washington or efforts to publicize allegations against Paul Manafort. What did U.S. officials know about these efforts in 2016, and how did they react? What were these federal agencies reactions to a Ukrainian court decision in December 2018 suggesting some Ukrainian officials had improperly meddled in the 2016 election?

<><> All State, CIA, FBI and DOJ documents concerning contacts with a Democratic National Committee contractor named Alexandra Chalupa and her dealings with the Ukrainian embassy in Washington or other Ukrainian figures. Did anyone in these U.S. government agencies interview or have contact with Chalupa during the time the Ukraine embassy in Washington says she was seeking dirt in 2016 on Trump and Manafort?
