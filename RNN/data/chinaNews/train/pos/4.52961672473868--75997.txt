The Government of the Argentine province of Mendoza stated that progress was being made in the procedures for the admission of fresh plums in the Chinese market. The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries of Argentina announced the creation of the Fresh Plum Registry with export conditions. They also stated that the National Agricultural Food Health and Quality Service, Senasa, is collaborating with the Asian country in the development of phytosanitary protocols, as a measure prior to the introduction of the product in China.

The steps taken through the Argentine Association of Plum for Industry (AACI) and the Industrial Plum Cluster, which is part of the Ministry of Economy and Energy of the Province, have been key for the advancement of the procedures.

The head of the AACI, Oscar Morbidelli, said that “the Chinese market has 1.4 billion inhabitants who consume this fruit, so it is not necessary to invest in dissemination campaigns because demand already exists. We got the approval of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Nation and we are waiting for the phytosanitary protocol of the Senasa to start exports.”

The opening of the Chinese market will also boost the packaging industry in the province, which is essential for exporting fresh fruit. Plums are expected to open that market to other fresh fruits, such as peach, pear, apricot, and canned fruits, such as peaches in syrup and fresh and dried plums in syrup, promoted by all the canning industry.

One of the Industrial Plum Cluster's goals for 2025 is to increase the value of exports by 20% and increase domestic consumption by the same amount, so these efforts are of great relevance.
