Continuing its Chinese Lunar Calendar series, the United Nations Postal Administration issued a special event sheet on Friday, celebrating the upcoming Chinese Lunar New Year - the Year of the Rat. This is the 11th sheet issued for UNPA's Lunar New Year stamp series.

The sheet is composed of 10 $1.20 denominated stamps with the United Nations logo. The tabs of the stamps and background design feature artwork by Chinese designer Yin Huili, with the colors of red and gold as the key tones. The patterns are inspired by traditional Chinese paper-cuttings.

The Year of the Rat is the first zodiac sign in the Chinese zodiac cycle. It will start on Jan 25, 2020 and last until Feb 11, 2021. People born in the Year of the Rat are believed to carry such character traits as being witty, positive, adaptable and curious.
