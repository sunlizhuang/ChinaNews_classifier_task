ZAGREB, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese cargo ship carrying steel parts for construction of Croatia's Peljesac Bridge arrived at the southern port Ploce on Monday.

The ship, Da Yu Xia owned by Chinese shipping company COSCO Shipping, departed China on Jan. 23 loaded with 29 pieces of steel box girders weighing about 6,300 tons, and will continue its voyage to the construction site at Mali Ston Bay after customs formalities this week.

Ploce port authority visited the ship in the early morning hours on Monday and gave permission for unloading at the construction site. Local health inspectors have cleared all 22 crew members onboard of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection.

"When it comes to coronavirus at the Peljesac Bridge site, everything is under control," Miljenko Ljubic, epidemiologist from the County Institute of Public Health of Dubrovnik-Neretva County, told Xinhua.

The Chinese ship underwent health inspections in Singapore and in the Suez Canal before arriving in the Adriatic, according to Croatian news agency HINA.

Crossing the Mali Ston Bay over the Adriatic Sea, the 2.4-kilometer-long Peljesac Bridge connects Croatia's southernmost Dubrovnik-Neretva County to the rest of the mainland.

A Chinese consortium led by China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) won the bid for the first phase of the bridge and its access roads in January 2018, with a promise to finish the job in 36 months. Construction officially kicked off in late July 2018 and has been progressing well since then.
