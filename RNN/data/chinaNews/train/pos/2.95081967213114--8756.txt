Reston Community Center is contemplating its future as the center celebrates its 40th anniversary.

A special community event, “RCC’s Past and Future,” is set for Monday, Feb. 10 from 6:30-8:30 p.m. at RCC Hunters Woods (2310 Colts Neck Road).

RCC is set to present the results of its community survey, as well as lead a discussion on its planning pillars of facilities, community, building, programs and communications.

Here’s more from RCC on the event:

RCC convenes the Community Relations and Program/Policy committees jointly each February to hear from its stakeholders and partners. This year will be a special gathering not just for the anniversary celebration, but so RCC’s Board of Governors and staff members can gather feedback as the agency looks toward 2021, when the next five-year strategic plan will be written and adopted. “We conclude our present five-year strategic plan in 2021,” said Beverly Cosham, RCC Board of Governors Chair. “Our approach typically overlaps the final year of one strategic plan with the engagement process to find out what is on our community’s minds that will shape the next one. This year, we look back to acknowledge the tremendous impact of Reston creating its community center in the image of the community and what that meant for the past 40 years.” RCC will be seeking input on the key topic areas of community interest. “We know that people want to discuss a possible performing arts venue; development of an online community calendar; partner challenges and other specific issues,” said Leila Gordon, RCC Executive Director. “This event is an opportunity to share views on those topics.”

Childcare for children ages 6 to 12 will be offered at the event. Translation support for Chinese, Arabic, Spanish and Russian will also be available.

Registration is requested before the event online.
