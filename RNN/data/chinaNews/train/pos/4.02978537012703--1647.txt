Valentine's Day has arrived, with plenty of people sure to panic-purchase heart-adorned cards, bumper boxes of chocolate, bouquets of red roses and teddy bears wearing T-shirts emblazoned with cutesy messages.

Now heavily commercialised and laden with expectation, the annual event was once a day where people earnestly showed their love and affection for another person.

The oldest surviving Valentine's poem was written by a prison-entrapped, pining lover: Charles, Duke of Orleans, wrote it for his wife in 1415, confined in the Tower of London after being captured at the Battle of Agincourt.

However, Valentine's Day was celebrated for centuries before that. From who the saint was to the best romantic gift ideas, here is everything you need to know about Valentine's Day.

When is Valentine's Day?

The event falls on the same day each year. February 14 of course. Couples across the globe typically recognise the annual celebration by exchanging gifts, flowers and cards, although it isn't a public holiday in every country.

While Valentine's Day is now heavily commercialised, the church originally decided to make the day a Christian celebration to honour St Valentine.

The feast of St Valentine was introduced in 496 by Pope Gelasius I, who included Valentine among all those "... whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose acts are known only to God."
