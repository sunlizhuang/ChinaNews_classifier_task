The Charlesworth Group celebrates its 20th-anniversary helping academics and scholarly publishers as the market-leading experts in China. Focusing on building customer relationships and delivering valuable services and technical solutions, The Charlesworth Group has evolved into an integral part of the publisher and author workflow and is clearly recognised as the ‘go-to’ company for Western publishers looking to improve their China footprint and sales.

The China business launched two decades ago to provide sales agency services to international publishers seeking to service the growing China academic market. Through its expansive networks, a passion for customer service and strong committed ongoing engagement with the local consortia and library communities, that business has grown significantly, and Charlesworth is now recognised as the leading dedicated sales agency in China. During that time, other complementary services have evolved, including social media management and author services offerings.

Innovation has always been at the heart of everything Charlesworth does, and this is showcased with a recently developed suite of WeChat targeted solutions to meet some of the unique challenges that come with providing services to the local China market.

The 20th Anniversary Reception, held in Beijing earlier in December, was attended by over 100 local distinguished guests from the local academic community, with representatives in attendance from Chinese Academy of Science, National Science and Technology Library, China Knowledge Network International, the British Embassy, Elsevier, Taylor & Francis, Frontiers and many others.
