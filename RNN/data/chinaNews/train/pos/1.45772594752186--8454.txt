Unshackled by European Union membership, Britain will be able to “turbo-charge” relations with Africa after Brexit by striking trade and business deals across the continent, the International Development Secretary has said.

Alok Sharma told the Telegraph that an unprecedented summit with African leaders in London next week offers Britain an important opportunity to flex its financial heft in the emerging world’s final frontier.

Amid warnings that British influence in a region it once dominated is on the wane, Boris Johnson’s vision of a “Global Britain” will be put to the test for the first time since his election victory in December when he hosts the inaugural UK-Africa Investment Summit on Monday.

The Prime Minister will seek to demonstrate British ambitions in a once overlooked part of the world by delivering the principal address of the summit himself.
