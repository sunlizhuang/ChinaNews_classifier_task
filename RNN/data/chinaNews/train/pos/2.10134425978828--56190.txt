Three Images Show The B-21 In Different AFB's Around The Country

The veil of secrecy is lifting... at least a little bit, as the Air Force has authorized the release of artist renderings of a stealthy B-21 Raider concept in hangars at a number of Air Force bases.

The images picture the B-21 in hangars at Dyess, Whiteman and Ellsworth AFBs and show some of the differences that are already becoming evident between the previous B-2 flying wing concept and the Next-Generation B-21 Raider.

Four years ago, the USAF designated the next-generation bomber as the Raider in honor of the legendary Doolittle Raiders. The late Richard E. Cole, the last surviving Doolittle Raider, made the announcement in 2016.

The new generation of stealth technology is being developed in response to upgrades in radar and air defense weapons developed and deployed by Russia and China. Technological advances are allowing stealth aircraft to be detected with greater accuracy. The B-21 is reportedly being manufactured to address those challenges.

Five years ago, the USAF awarded the next-gen bomber contract to Northrop Gruuman... estimating the value at $21.4 billion. At this point, with all costs tallied up, the program is said to be worth $55 billion over the entire program life.
