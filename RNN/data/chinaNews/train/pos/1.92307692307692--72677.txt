The video, which is now making the rounds on the internet, was posted by a Chinese media portal on Twitter with a caption that read, “What a spectacular wonder! Five suns are seen shining in the sky in N. China’s Inner Mongolia.”

However, there is a scientific explanation to this which states it as an elaborate optical illusion that requires temperatures of -20 degrees. Isn’t that amazing?



This phenomenon is also known as Sundog or Parhelion, and it usually appears when ice crystals create high clouds and produce reflected sunlight that leads to the appearance of mock suns in the sky.

According to NASA, “Sun dogs are like a new type of ice halos and formed by plate-shaped ice crystals drift down from the sky – like leaves fluttering from trees.”

Here’s what people on the internet have to say about the beautiful view-

That’s true.

It usually can be seen in the presence of ice crystals in the atmosphere and at places where there are cirrus clouds.
