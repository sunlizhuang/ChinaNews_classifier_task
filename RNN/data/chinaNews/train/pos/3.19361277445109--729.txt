I do appreciate the problem as sometimes when I seek a particular item, one seller includes dozens or even hundreds of the same item. i.e. I look for a generic item for my motorcycle and one particular product is listed dozens of times by the same seller as xxxxx-Honda, xxxxx-Honda CB250, xxxx-Honda Xl500 etc etc. It takes forever to scroll past to find the next vendor selling a different product.



Bill Report them to ebay. They are not supposed to list multiple copies of the same item. There is a limit of 10. There is a "Report item" link on every listing. This comes under listing practices. Robert G8RPI. The way round this is to have multiple shops, which many do. They often have similar names and list pretty much the same inventory. At this time there is no reason why you can't do this. Regards. David.

Neil Yes, I agree in general for a lot of things, but for certain things the " few percent saving " can be a few hundred percent if coming from China, and then it becomes much more difficult to justify.

Neil Yesterday I was looking to see if I could get some 440C stainless steel flat bar for a kitchen related project. All I could find in the UK was round bar. When I looked on EBay, there were a small number of sellers listing flat bar. All were Chinese. I guess they'll get the order when I get around to the job.

A large percentage of my purchases on ebay are from private individuals, who do not necessarily list their items in the most logical way. Only scanning through huge numbers of listings more or less at random will stand any chance of seeing them. A year or so back, one of the well known UK based suppliers was listing reamers individually in increments of 0.01mm. Their listings ran into thousands and swamped ebay. Fortunately that has stopped, maybe they now allow the purchaser to order the size they want. I am attracted to things that are a bit out of the ordinary. As for supporting UK based suppliers, I do and a lot of my Chinese and Indian tooling comes through these middlemen.

Slight "fred drift", but has anyone experience of paying VAT and possibly duty on purchases from China that are above the price threshold of £15 or so? Is it payable to the Postie who makes the delivery? Clive

The possibility of getting customs duty, VAT and the Post offices fee added to the cost always discourages me from spending too much on these imports. If they want to sting me one day, I will politely tell them to keep it.

1 articles Postie does not collect probably too likely to be mugged. When I buy engine kits from the US they go to customd warehouse when they arrive here and then parcel force send a bill which you have to pay before it is released for delivery. Cost consists of any import duty, Fee for collecting and VAT on the lot

Reply to Clive: Yes Clive, I have paid these charges. Paying the VAT is understandable, paying the Post Office £8.00 'admin fee' less so! However, i weigh up the total cost and decide if the item is worth it - it may still be cheaper than buying locally. In the cases I have experienced the item is held at the post office that keeps your undelivered mail and the postie drops a card through your door. You proceed to the post office, hand over the cash (or card) and the item is yours. John

Jason B is correct ref the USA, as for the Chinese they are quite creative with item values so I haven't been charged import duty, collection fee, VAT & any other tax they can think up,as yet. Tony

Tony Yes it's a disgrace. It feels as bad a buying fake or stolen goods. I also hate buying an item apparently from a U.K. supplier whose advert is emblazoned with a Union Jack, only to find it is nothing of the kind. £1.35 to send a letter from UK to Ireland, £1 to send 10kg package from China to U.K (presumably air freight given the speed of delivery) who is the one laughing?

Sometimes I wonder how they can do it. But they do.
