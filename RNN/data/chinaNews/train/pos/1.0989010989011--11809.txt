UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy on Thursday asked parties in Yemen to stay on the course of political settlement.

Parties in Yemen need to work for the implementation of the Stockholm Agreement and the Riyadh Agreement and strive for an early restart of the UN-led all-round political process, said Wu Haitao, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations.

Despite setbacks in its implementation, the Stockholm Agreement between the government and Houthi rebels has played an important role in easing tension in Hodeidah governorate and promoting dialogue among Yemeni parties, Wu told the Security Council.

The December 2018 Stockholm Agreement must continue to be implemented, he said.

The implementation of the November 2019 Riyadh Agreement between the government and the Southern Transitional Council bears directly on political negotiations in the next step. China encourages Yemeni parties to jointly maintain solidarity and stability in the south to safeguard the country's sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity, he said.

Wu asked the international community to carry out robust mediation to help create the conditions for dialogue and negotiations among Yemeni parties.

The Security Council needs to remain seized of the issue of Yemen and discuss how to promote dialogue and negotiations among Yemeni parties through various means, and exchange views on how to further implement the existing agreements, calm the situation in Aden, and strive for a complete cease-fire across the country, he said.

Countries in the region need to continue to exercise positive influence on Yemeni parties and to build confidence through prisoner exchange and other measures, and maintain the peace momentum.

China, which has stood in contact with all Yemeni parties, will continue its diplomatic efforts to help the parties narrow their differences and broaden consensus, said Wu.

The international community also should help improve the humanitarian situation in the war-torn country, he said.

The priority is to guarantee the supply of oil, food and drinking water; stabilize the currency and commodity prices; contain cholera and other diseases; help with development and reconstruction projects; improve education and training, and increase employment.

China has constantly provided humanitarian assistance to the Yemeni people through bilateral and multilateral channels, while advocating the idea of promoting peace and stability through development, said Wu.

China stands ready to continue to do more for the Yemeni people and engage in Yemen's reconstruction so as to play a constructive role for the early arrival of lasting peace and stability in Yemen, he said. Enditem
