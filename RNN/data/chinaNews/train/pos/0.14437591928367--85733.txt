China's Ambassador to Russia Zhang Hanhui said on Monday that an effective vaccine for the coronavirus has been created in China, but that it still needs further testing.

"China has developed a vaccine that shows immunity. But these are preliminary results and time is needed for further tests and fine-tuning the vaccine," emphasized Hanhui.

This statement comes after claims made by World Health Organization's Director-General Tedros Adhanom that it will take between 12 and 18 months before a vaccine is ready. Meanwhile, UK scientists also began COVID-19 vaccine tests on animals.
