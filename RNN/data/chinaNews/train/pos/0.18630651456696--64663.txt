It would be SMHA's first property that isn't solely housing.

CANTON The Stark Metropolitan Housing Authority and a Jackson Township developer plan to create a housing and retail complex on 30th Street NW.

The vacant Arthur J. Cirelli building would be demolished and replaced with a mixed-use development. Ashley Wright, director of planning and development for SMHA, said the housing authority would oversee housing while Glitz & Associates would oversee retail.

"We are looking to do a mixed-income development there, if possible, which would include market rate and some subsidized housing," she said.

It would be the first SMHA residence that isn't solely housing.

"We're looking to diversify our portfolio here at SMHA, and we think this'll be a good step for us going forward to do that," Wright said.

Canton City Council is expected to discuss the issue tonight and vote on two ordinances related to the transfer of city-owned property and corresponding Canton Community Improvement Corporation (CCIC) policies. Council members stopped deliberations during a committee meeting for lack of a consensus and time this week.

They'll continue discussions during committee meetings, which begin at 6 p.m., before the regular meeting at 7 p.m. in City Hall.

Cirelli building

The single-story building in the 600 block of 30th Street NW was built in 1963. It and a warehouse housed the city's utility billing services, information technology offices, and police dispatch and SWAT headquarters — all of which relocated in the past two years.

The city took possession in the early 2000s and inherited a host of structural problems, according to past reports.

The most recent estimate for roof repair, mold remediation and other fixes was $1.15 million.

Deputy Mayor Fonda Williams told council members the ordinances before them are time sensitive because the building is "full of black mold" and "full of asbestos."

"We're always on other property owners for taking care of their properties," he said this week.

Council legislation

One ordinance awaiting the council's vote would authorize the mayor or public service director to transfer the 30th Street NW property to the CCIC. The CCIC would then convey the land to Giltz and Associates for the joint project with SMHA.

In a memo to council requesting the legislation, Williams stated that the end users committed to demolishing the building within 60 days.

"Their plans for housing and retail will complement existing uses on 30th Street NW," he wrote. "We are hopeful that, by conveying the property to the CCIC, an agreement can be reached to convey this property to SMHA and a developer, repurposed, and be added to the city of Canton's tax base."

The other ordinance, which spurred the most questions from council members, would change rules related to land transfers involving CCIC. Ohio law enables community improvement corporations to act as a pass-through entity for economic development projects, allowing municipalities to bypass an otherwise required advertising and bidding process.

The original 1988 agreement between the city of Canton and CCIC requires fair market value for any property purchased through the CCIC. Law Director Kristen Bates Aylward said that is not a state mandate for these corporations.

"It's perfectly legal to attach any kind of safeguard you want," she told the council.

An amendment already approved by the nine-member CCIC would remove the market value clause. Mayor Thomas Bernabei said the 100 to 150 property transactions in the CCIC's history haven't involved fair market value.

Bates said there haven't been any worthwhile properties exchanged before this point.

"They didn't have value," she said.

The two 30th Street NW parcels under consideration were appraised in 2018 at a total value of $1.3 million, according to Stark County property records. Williams said a recent visit by the county auditor, however, lowered the value to roughly $500,000.

During council discussions, Williams cited the former Lehman High School as an example of a successful CCIC deal.

"I think it's important to note that the administration has not and will not operate in a vacuum," he said.

Developers a.m. Rodriguez Associates have plans to establish senior housing at the Lehman property and have a $10 purchase option with the CCIC. The parcel's appraised value totaled $106,900 in 2018, according to county records.

Councilman John Mariol II, D-7, asked if council could attach stipulations to property transfers if the market value isn't required. Bates said that's possible, but the current ordinance related to the Cirelli building does not stipulate a price for the developer and housing authority.

Amending the agreement between the CCIC and city also would remove the CCIC's ability to act as an agent for Canton. The CCIC can negotiate deals for City Council to approve with a direct land transfer from the city to the end user.

Although this method has never been used, Bates cautioned the council that both the city and CCIC would need to approve any future changes to the agreement.

"If you cede that now, you may or may not be able to get it back later," she said.

Councilmen Robert Fisher, D-5, and Frank Morris, D-9, questioned the apparent loss of council oversight with the amendments.

Bernabei, however, said the measures don't take away council "authority in any way, shape or form."

Although council can attach property value, Morris said, doing so would mean members would have to do the research.

"CCIC and the current agreement worked on the Lehman project," he said. "It'll work moving forward."

Site potential

SMHA currently owns the 100-unit Plaza Terrace Apartments beside the Cirelli building. Wright said its subsidized housing will remain regardless of what happens with the mixed-use complex.

The housing authority is awaiting City Council's decision before developing more detailed plans, she said. SMHA's ability to afford market value likely would depend on the total cost of the project, which has yet to be determined.

"We're very much interested in being there on 30th Street," Wright said. "We think it's a great location for future residents with all the amenities right there."

More detail — including the amenities, number of units and mix of market rate and subsidized housing — would come later. Wright said SMHA expects to connect with a finance institution and architect as plans progress.

The property also is expected to need replatted and rezoned to accommodate the development. Wright said there's not yet a timeline for completion.

"It's definitely a priority," she said.
