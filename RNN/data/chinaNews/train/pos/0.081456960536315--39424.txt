FARGO — Forbes Publisher and Futurist Richard Karlgaard will talk "Tech, Trade, Turbulence and the 2020 Elections" during his keynote address at the Fargo Moorhead West Fargo Chamber of Commerce's annual Economic Forum from noon to 1:30 p.m. Feb. 20 at the Delta by Marriott, 1635 42nd St. S.

In early 2016, Karlgaard predicted Donald Trump would win the presidency. Karlgaard will now don his political-economic lens once more to provide insight on the 2020 elections – and how it will all likely impact the U.S. economy and markets. He'll tackle the following questions:

How strong, really, is the U.S. economy?

What will trigger the next recession and when? Is the stock market poised for a crash, and how will we know one is coming?

How far will President Trump take his trade war, and how will China respond?

Why are new technologies like AI making it hard for businesses to keep up and how should you deal with AI, the Cloud, IoT and digital disruption?

Will big tech’s disruptors (Amazon, Facebook and Google) finally be regulated?

Which cities and states are best poised for future growth?

Karlgaard, a North Dakota native, is the author of "The Soft Edge: Where Great Companies Find Lasting Success" and "Team Genius: The New Science of High Performing Organizations." This is the second consecutive year Karlgaard was asked to headline the event.
