“The head of state gave an instruction to consider sending Belarus' healthcare officials and leading experts to China to study the situation and exchange views. As of today, the virus has not been studied inside and out. Our specialists have a wealth of experience in combating communicable diseases and we would like to share our expertise and knowledge in order to determine the most efficient preventive measures and protocols to treat complications,” Vladimir Karanik said.

In his words, such cooperation will benefit both China and Belarus. “We want this visit to be as fruitful as possible. In other words, it will take place after China amasses enough information and their experts get ready to exchange views. We have already put together a group of experts. As soon as the time is ripe, the group led by me will leave for China,” the minister said.

On 29 January Belarus will send a humanitarian cargo (about 20 tonnes of medicines and medical products) to Beijing to help Chinese partners handle the epidemic. Vladimir Karanik informed that the cargo was put together based on China's requests.

The minister emphasized that no one questions China's ability to keep the situation under control, however all the resources are concentrated in the most affected areas right now. Other regions of the country are gripped with panic, which is one of the reasons for panic buying of some medicines and medical products. “Thus, any help and reserves available at the Chinese Ministry of Health will come in handy,” Vladimir Karanik believes.
