Colombo (News 1st): Additional Secretary to the President for Foreign Relations Admiral Dr Jayanath Colombage says the number one pillar of our foreign policy is neutrality and that we don’t want to be labelled or get caught in this power game.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, Admiral Colombage said “Together with neutrality, we expect the other countries to respect our sovereignty. We are a sovereign nation, equal in the international scene.”

The Admiral said the strength of Sri Lanka is to be neutral, as foreign nations including India, America, Japan, China, Australia, the European Union, and England are interested.

When questioned about dimensions of Sri Lanka’s relations with India and China, Admiral Colambage said “As far as security is concerned, our priority is India. For economic aspects, we are open. The President has invited European Union, Australia, Singapore and everyone to come and invest. The President asked them not to miss this opportunity. If you miss it, someone will fill this vacuum. That someone is invariably China.”

We at News 1st commend Dr Colombage on his position on Sri Lanka’s neutrality. Sri Lanka an independent nation, and its strategic geopolitical position gives us the option of maintaining that neutrality, as opposed to being toyed by nations with their own interests at heart.

As far as security is concerned; it is not dependent on any other nation but rather on our own interests. A nation cannot be neutral if a nation is dependent. And so our hope is that Sri Lanka will strengthen herself as a united nation and stand firm against any incursion into our sovereignty, that may come hidden as gifts and grants.
