EXCITING OPPORTUNITY TO EMBRACE NEW TECHNOLOGIES, A NEW CULTURE AND TO ADD A NEW LANGUAGE

BREVARD COUNTY, FLORIDA – China! We hear so much about the country and its people, but do we truly understand either?

As we enter the new decade, millions of American students will come of age in the era of US/Chinese integration and for many, this represents an exciting opportunity to embrace new technologies, a new culture and to add a new language to their skillset.

Florida Prep the Melbourne based, International Day and Boarding academy for students in grades 5-12 is at the forefront of this trend.

The school offers a unique native taught Mandarin Language program to AP level, teams with a sister academy; Bachuan International School, in Chongqing, China, and each year hosts numerous college-bound Chinese students eager to share their Mandarin language skills with fellow classmates.

To commemorate this ongoing partnership Florida Prep is excited to offer a free ‘China One on One’ workshop to students in grades 5th through 12th during the ‘2020 Lunar New Year’ celebrations on Saturday, January 25th.

In a fast-paced, age-appropriate, two-hour workshop students will examine a brief history of China, discuss the Chinese culture and learn basic greetings and social media etiquette.

Each workshop will conclude with the sharing of Lunar New Year gift envelopes and Chinese dumplings.

Places are limited, so be sure to register now. For more information contact admissions@flprep.com or call 321 723 3211.
