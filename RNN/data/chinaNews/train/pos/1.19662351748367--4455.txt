The newly-appointed director of Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong, Luo Huining, has held a meeting with former chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, reportedly telling him he deserves praise for putting his utmost efforts into developing the SAR since he left office, RTHK reports.

A statement issued by the liaison office also quoted Luo as saying Tung had made historic contributions towards implementing the "One Country, Two Systems" principle and the Basic Law.

Luo said he hopes Tung, who is a vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, can continue to play a proactive role in maintaining the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, the statement said.

It added that the two men discussed the current situation in Hong Kong and its deep-rooted problems.

Luo and Tung met yesterday, the liaison office said, the same day the mainland envoy held a meeting with Chief Executive Carrie Lam. A statement had said Luo told Lam he admired her "courage" and "sense of responsibility" in leading Hong Kong during its months of social unrest.

Luo, a former Shanxi province Communist Party secretary, replaced Wang Zhimin as liaison office chief last weekend.
