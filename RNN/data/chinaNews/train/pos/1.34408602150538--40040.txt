A Sacramento artist visiting her family in China is asking her friends in the U.S. to help send supplies to fight coronavirus.Lin Fei Fei booked her trip before the outbreak. She said now, finding things to prevent the spread of the virus is nearly impossible.When some of her fellow artists heard about the need, they wanted to help.“Trying is better than not doing anything at all,” said Rachel Kerns, an artist in Sacramento.Kerns said Sacramento’s art community is vibrant and committed to helping.“It’s amazing,” she said. “I think that’s what makes Sacramento so special.”It’s a community Lin knew she wanted to join when she moved to the U.S. from China.“She had a very specific style,” Kerns said, describing her friend’s art. “It makes it very diverse and beautiful.”Lin’s murals draw attention around the city, but it's what she posted on Instagram that caught Kern’s eye. “Where most people are posting casual, day-to-day stuff, she’s going to the grocery store with her family and there’s not much to find, and asking to send masks because they’re running out,” Kerns said. Lin was posting pictures of empty shelves and messages of disbelief. Places she recognized in China were empty as people stayed inside to avoid coming in contact with the coronavirus.“I just can’t imagine that ever happening and that fear and helplessness,” Kerns said.Kerns started a GoFundMe to raise money for supplies, things like masks and hand sanitizer. She’s working with other Sacramento artists to collect items and ship them overseas.“We’re just trying to do whatever we can to help with whatever resources we have available and taking it one day at a time,” Kerns said.In an Instagram post, Kerns asked the community for help and within 24 hours, they raised $200. She knows every dollar and donation will make a difference.“Maybe I can’t do that much, but even if I was just able to send one mask or send one bottle of sanitizer, that could help her,” Kerns said. Lin said she’s grateful for the support from her Sacramento community. She said she’s got a return flight to the U.S. booked for next month, but is waiting to see if she’ll be allowed to fly.
