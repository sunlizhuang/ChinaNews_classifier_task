This report includes statistical data and analysis of nonwoven fabric production in Asia for the period 2010-18, and provides detailed data for China, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.

In addition, the data are broken down by the type of nonwoven fabric produced, including: chemical bonded; thermal bonded; needlepunched; spunlaced; spunbonded and meltblown; other dry-laid; and wet-laid. China was Asia’s largest producer of nonwoven fabrics in 2018, and production in the country was up compared with the previous year.

There were also increases in nonwoven fabric production in India--where production was up significantly compared with the previous year--and in Indonesia and Japan. In South Korea and Taiwan, however, nonwoven fabric production was down. The most important category of nonwoven produced in Asia in 2018 was that of spunbonded and meltblown nonwoven fabrics.

Overall, nonwoven fabric production in Asia has grown at a healthy pace as usage of products made from nonwovens in the region has increased rapidly in recent years. Looking to the future, such growth is expected to continue as a result of strong economic growth and rising incomes per head.
