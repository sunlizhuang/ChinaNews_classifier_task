President Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping early Friday for “leading the counterattack” against the coronavirus, saying the leader was leading “what will be a very successful operation.”

“He is strong, sharp and powerfully focused on leading the counterattack on the Coronavirus. He feels they are doing very well, even building hospitals in a matter of only days,” the president said on Twitter after speaking by telephone with Xi.

“Nothing is easy, but he will be successful, especially as the weather starts to warm & the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone,” Trump continued.

“Great discipline is taking place in China, as President Xi strongly leads what will be a very successful operation. We are working closely with China to help!”

White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a tweet about the phone call that “President Trump expressed confidence in China’s strength and resilience in confronting the challenge of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak.”
