JAKARTA (Bernama): Indonesia has evacuated 238 of its citizens from Hubei, China, and placed them under quarantine for 14 days at Natuna Island.

The Batik Air commercial aircraft carrying them from Wuhan landed at the Hang Nadim Airport, Batam Island, about 8.45am West Indonesian time on Sunday (Feb 2).

According to local media, all of them were flown by three military aircraft to Natuna Island, a province of Riau Islands, located in the South China Sea.

They are placed at the Indonesian military base on the island, which is reported to be fully equipped, and will undergo a 14-day health inspection and monitoring process before being allowed to return to their families.

There have been no cases of new coronavirus reported in Indonesia.

“All of them are reported to be healthy and free from infection. The Chinese government has also determined that only healthy people are allowed out of the affected areas,” said Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto.

On Thursday (Jan 30), President Joko Widodo ordered Indonesians in Wuhan, Hubei to return to the republic, in the wake of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak. – Bernama
