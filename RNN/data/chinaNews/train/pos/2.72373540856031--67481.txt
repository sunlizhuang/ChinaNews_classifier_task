The R&D-topics of interest at the SiliconPV2020 show will range from material aspects, characterization, new cell concepts, process technologies, process integration and cell manufacturing and assembly to module technology, including the rapidly increasing activity on tandem approaches, where a high-band gap partner is integrated above a Si bottom-cell to achieve conversion efficiencies beyond the limits of single-junction Si cells.

Cooperation with nPV and bifiPV

As in previous years, the nPV workshop will take place after the SiliconPV conference with an overlapping day. This will give participants a complete overview of all trends, innovations and developments of n-type technology.

New for 2020: A bifiPV workshop will be affiliated to the SiliconPV Conference and the nPV workshop. The goal of the bifiPV event is not only to review all existing technologies on the market but also to set standards, identify market potential and improve the bankability of bifacial PV.

The detailed scientific program of the SiliconPV oral and poster sessions has been published online. The conference will again cover a variety of exciting topics with the newest results in the field. Go to our interactive detailed program and click on the session titles to get details on all oral presentations and posters.

The conference dinner, several side events and generous breaks offer a lot of possibilities for discussions and networking. A technical tour to Chint Solar/Astronergy in Hangzhou will complement the program, allowing participants to visit the PV production line in Hangzhou.
