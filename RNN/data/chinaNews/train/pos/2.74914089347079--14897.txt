Lotte Duty Free partnered with Lancôme to jointly celebrate its 40th anniversary and the kick off to its Lunar New Year holiday promotions with a surprise drone show, that lit up the night sky on 18 January at the Seokchon Lake in Songpa-gu, Seoul.

The 300-strong drone show ’embroidered’ the sky with a selection of illuminations including white mice to commemorate the Lunar New Year theme of Year of the Rat. These projections were shown together with motifs to mark the 40th anniversary of Lotte Duty Free and the Gyeonggi New Year in 2020.

Simultaneously, Lotte organised a light display, this time on the facade of the Lotte World Tower and again with Lancôme as a brand partner showing its rose logo, to promote both the retailer’s 40th anniversary visual campaign and highlighting the beauty brand’s close association with Lotte for this campaign.

Seung-Kook Lee, head of the Lotte Duty Free said: “In commemoration of the 40th anniversary of Lotte Duty Free Shop in 2020, we are proud to be presenting drone shows with global beauty brand Lancôme.”

As reported, in December, Lotte Duty Free unveiled its 40th anniversary commemorative merchandise range comprising a desktop calendar, and shopping bags. As its 40th anniversary year unfolds, Lotte Duty Free plans to reveal further exclusive products created in collaboration with a number of major brands.
