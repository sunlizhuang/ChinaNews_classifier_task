A 34-member Zhejiang Wu Opera Troupe from China thrilled residents of the Federal Capital Territory to scintillating performances at the NAF Event Centre, Kado, Abuja, on Friday.

The event was part of activities for the celebration of the Chinese New Year.

Established in 1956, the troupe presented different choreographic performances, musical pieces and martial art displays to the amusement of the guests.

Performances included the goddess of heaven scatters flowers, divergent path, broken bridge, monkey king martial, Hui hu solo tune and skill face changing, among others.

Guests at the event included the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, who was represented by the Director of Legal Service in the ministry, Mr Jacob Ehicheoya; the Cultural Counsellor of the Chinese Embassy, Mr Li Xuda; and the Chinese Embassy Press Attaché, Mr Sun Saixiong, and among other dignitaries.

In his address, Xuda said the troupe had performed in over 40 countries, adding that it was one of the most popular troupes in China.

Xuda stressed the importance of culture, which he described as a nation’s soul, noting that the essence of cultural exchange was to encourage people to people exchange, which according to him, promotes mutual understanding and learning between countries.

“As the Chinese New Year is approaching, let’s take this opportunity to say Happy Chinese New Year to you. The troupe visits Nigeria with the aim to promoting cultural exchanges and strengthen the traditional friendship between China and Nigeria,” he said.

While wishing Chinese nationals in the country a prosperous New Year, Ehicheoya expressed delight at the troop’s performance.
