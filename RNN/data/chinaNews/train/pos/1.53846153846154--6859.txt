US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox News Channel that the US-China trade deal phase one is a “very, very extensive agreement”. And, “it is USD 200B of additional products across the board over the next two years, and, specifically in agriculture, USD 40B to USD 50B.”

He also emphasized that the deal “wasn’t changed in translation”. The translation process was a “technical issue”. At the day of signing, the administration “will be releasing the English version”. It’s reported that the final Chinese text was not completed yet.

China Vice Premier Liu He will lead a delegation to the US today and is set to sign the trade deal in Washington on Wednesday.
