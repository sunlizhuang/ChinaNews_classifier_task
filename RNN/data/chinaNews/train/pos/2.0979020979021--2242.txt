China will continue to deepen all dimensional cooperation with Pakistan: Geng Shuang

China says it will continue to deepen all dimensional cooperation with Pakistan for greater quality development of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and to deliver more benefits to our peoples.

Chinese Foreign Ministryâ€™s Spokesperson Geng Shuang during regular media briefing in Beijing said the amended protocol to the FTA between China and Pakistan has entered into force last month.

The second phase of CPFTA allows the Pakistani manufacturers and traders to export around 313 new products on zero duty to the Chinese market and Pakistan has been allowed to export a total of 1047 products to China on zero duty.

With the implementation of second phase Pakistan's exports to China are likely to touch 4 to 5 billion dollars in the medium term after setting up a new industry in the special economic zones.
