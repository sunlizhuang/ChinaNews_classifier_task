ITHACA, N.Y. (WBNG) -- Cornell University says it does not permit students traveling to mainland China in wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

Faculty and staff at the university must get approval from from Cornell's International Travel Advisory and Response Team to travel.

The university says it "strongly recommends" against personal travel to the country.

Campus officials say the university is prepared if the coronavirus comes to New York.

â€œCornell Health has procedures in place to quickly identify anyone who might require evaluation and care for coronavirus, as well as an operational plan in the event of a national outbreak," says Assistant Vice President of Student Campus Life for Health and Welling Sharon McCullen.

The campus says its committed to working with students if the travel advisory affects their academics.
