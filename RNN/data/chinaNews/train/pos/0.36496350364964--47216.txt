WUHAN, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- Entrusted by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, Vice Premier Sun Chunlan has inspected a newly-delivered hospital to combat coronavirus in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province.

Sun is leading a central government group to guide the epidemic control work in Hubei Province. The group visited Huoshenshan (Fire God Mountain) Hospital to oversee hospital facilities and equipment.

Approved by Xi, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission, 1,400 medical staff from the armed forces are tasked with treating patients in the hospital starting from Monday.

Sun expressed her belief that with the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, the great strength of the unity of the army and the people, and the unity of the people of the whole country, China will surely win the battle of epidemic prevention and control.

She thanked workers in the hospital construction, saying that the hospital, as a result of the around-the-clock efforts involving 7,000 workers, serves as an interpretation of "China speed."

Huoshenshan Hospital, with a capacity of 1,000 beds, is a makeshift hospital dedicated to treating patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
