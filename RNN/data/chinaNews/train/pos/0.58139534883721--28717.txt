WASHINGTON — U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, met with Terry Brandstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, to discuss Illinois agriculture, including President Donald Trump’s recently announced Phase 1 trade deal with China.

Durbin, D-Illinois, shared his concerns with the Trump administration’s “haphazard” trade approach with China and how soybean farmers in Illinois previously enjoyed a productive trade market with Chinese partners.
