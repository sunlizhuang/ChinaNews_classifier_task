This world is full of beautiful sights that are just waiting to take our breath away. However, for some reason, most of us keep going to the tried-and-tested locations just because they are most commonly advertised. In case you are not really interested in visiting staples like the Great Wall of China, the Eiffel Tower and the Statue of Liberty, or you’ve already seen them and, instead, your goal is to find as many unique spots as you can on this planet, you’ve come to the right place. Below, we will give you some suggestions which are sure to blow your mind and provide you with some stunning photos. Take a look.

Dead Vlei

If you ever find yourself in Africa, or more specifically Namibia, you must visit Dead Vlei. The name of this white clay pan translates to “dead marsh” and when you actually see it, you will understand why. For a while, the climate allowed camel thorn trees to grow but then the climate changed and the area was affected by a drought which caused the trees to die. Even though this is believed to have happened around 1340-1430, the skeletons of the trees still remain and create this unique setting. Plus, this dried oasis is surrounded by orange dunes that are perhaps the highest in the world. Once you’re in Namibia, decide whether you will drive on your own or get a safari shuttle to take you there. Just don’t forget about sunscreen and water!

Pamukkale thermal pools

In case you are looking for a more relaxing holiday, you can explore all the wonders that Turkey has to offer. When there, you should not overlook the Pamukkale thermal pools. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is located in Denizli and its name means “cotton castle” because it actually looks like balls of cotton. The hot spring waters cascade down several tiers and the vistas are quite stunning. While taking a dip in the turquoise pools is no longer allowed, you will have to settle for some amazing snaps for your Instagram page. Seeing as how it is a well-known attraction, getting there should not be a problem.

Lake Hillier

We are all aware of the natural wonders that can be found in Australia, from the Great Barrier Reef to Uluru. However, one unique sight that is not often talked about is Lake Hillier – a saline lake notable for its pink color. Located on Middle Island just south of Western Australia and surrounded by eucalyptus and paperback trees as well as a rim of sand, it can be hard to reach. Luckily, you can opt for a private jet hire in Perth or any other Australian city or go for a cruise that will allow you to visit this breathtaking area.

Salar de Uyuni

Is South America more your style? Then you are in for a treat. While there are so many unique places to visit on this continent, you definitely need to see Bolivia’s Salar de Uyuni. A remnant of prehistoric lakes that evaporated a long time ago, the largest salt flat on the planet stretches for over 4,050 square miles. This area has two distinct seasons. To witness its stunning mirror effect, you need to be there during the rainy season; however, it is not uncommon for tours to be canceled due to excessive rain. On the other hand, during the dry season, the ground is hardened so visitors can drive across the flat. There are plenty of tours available, many of them including visits to local geysers, hot springs, volcanos and deserts for an amazing active vacation.

Zhangye National Geopark

While the Great Wall of China is a unique sight that most people dream of visiting, this country has plenty of wonders that people rarely talk about. One of them is most certainly the Zhangye National Geopark. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is home to the Rainbow Mountains, a colorful landform that is sure to leave you breathless. Getting there could be a bit tricky as you might have to change a few planes and get a bus or taxi to the park. However, once there, you will get to climb several viewing platforms and take snaps of gorgeous vistas that will make all your friends envious. Keep in mind, though, that the park doesn’t offer any shade so bring a hat, water and sunscreen. Furthermore, a face mask will protect you from the dusty wind and a fan can be useful seeing as how the temperatures can get quite high.

Ruby Falls

If your travels take you on a road trip across the United States, you should make Ruby Falls one of your stops. This waterfall, found within Lookout Mountain near Chattanooga, Tennessee, was opened to the public in 1929. At 145 feet, it is the tallest and deepest underground waterfall in the U.S. Besides seeing the breathtaking waterfall, there is a wide variety of activities you can partake in, from exploring ancient geological formations to get your adrenaline pumping by going zip-lining.

Regardless of whether you are traveling to stay in shape, to escape your everyday life or just to see a unique sight, choosing any of these six locations is definitely the right decision. There is something odd and special to see on every continent, you just have to do some research and prepare yourself properly before you set off into the world. Enjoy!
