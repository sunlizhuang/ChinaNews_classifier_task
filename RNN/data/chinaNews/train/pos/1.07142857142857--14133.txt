KUALA LUMPUR: While PKR deputy president Datuk Seri Azmin Ali says the Kimanis loss should not be misconstrued as declining support for Pakatan Harapan, the party president wants the coalition to come out with effective ways to woo the voters over.

“This is not the time to play the blame game but to face reality and do something to prevent further erosion of support, ” Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said.

He said Pakatan has to come up with more effective ways to win back the people’s hearts, Bernama reported.

“We have the result and we have to accept it. To the winning candidate, congratulations and continue your service... I believe Sabah, under the leadership of Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal, will continue to strive for excellence, ” he said when met at the Port Dickson Chinese New Year Open House 2020 in Taman Lukut Hartamar here on Saturday night.

Meanwhile, Azmin said the loss cannot be misconstrued as declining support for Pakatan.He said the winning voting margin for Barisan Nasional to retain the seat was small.

“Therefore, the issue of declining support does not arise. Kimanis is a rural constituency and we need more time to convince the voters of the government’s initiatives to bridge the rural-urban gap, ” he said when he visited the Ampang market with Housing and Local Government Minister Zuraida Kamaruddin yesterday.

Expressing confidence in Warisan’s performance since the last general election, he said more time was needed to resolve major legacy issues plaguing the state.

“Sabahans need to be convinced that they can look forward to a better future under the wings of Warisan, ” he said.
