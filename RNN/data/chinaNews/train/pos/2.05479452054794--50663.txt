You might not know it by its name, but surely you've noticed snaking queues at cash deposit machines on a particular day around Chinese New Year. This date is called Li Chun (立春), and depositing cash has become quite a Singaporean tradition in the past few years.

According to some fengshui master or other, Li Chun is supposedly an auspicious day for you to deposit money in your bank account.

If you're wondering when, where and why Li Chun 2020 is all about, here's a dummies' guide. (Read all the way to the bottom for advice on how you can ACTUALLY make money with your money for Li Chun!)

NOW WAIT JUST A MINUTE, WHAT IN THE BLAZES IS LI CHUN (立春)?

For the benefit of anyone who isn't Chinese, is Chinese but studied in ACS, or is simply a potato, I'll briefly explain Li Chun (Chinese: 立春) in this section.

Li Chun is a date on the Chinese calendar that signifies the beginning of spring. This date often falls around Chinese New Year, although the date of CNY can actually be before or after Li Chun.

This year, Li Chun falls on 4 Feb 2020. That's 10 days after Chinese New Year on 25 Jan 2020.

Okay, so now you're wondering what this date has to do with depositing money at the ATM, right?

I don't have any answer for you, other than that fengshui works in mysterious ways.

I mean, I can get why Li Chun is celebrated in China, since agriculture was a significant part of the country's history. But in Singapore, there are no seasons and our agriculture is limited to preschoolers planting bean sprouts in cotton wool.

Guess you could say we celebrate Li Chun by "planting" money in our bank accounts.

By the way, this whole queueing up at the ATM to deposit money is a totally new thing. It's only been around for a few years. Don't believe me, go ask your parents if they ever did such a thing when they were younger.

WHEN SHOULD YOU DEPOSIT MONEY? LI CHUN 2020 DATE & TIME SLOTS

It's not good enough to simply deposit cash at the ATM at any random time on 4 Feb 2020. You need to time your cash deposit endeavour in order to maximise your chances of "good fortune".

For that reason, every publication in Singapore - whether it's Lianhe Zaobao or International Fengshui Herald - will publish a cute chart showing you when, exactly, on 4 Feb you should deposit cash, based on your Chinese zodiac sign. Apparently, this year Li Chun starts at 5.18pm on 4 Feb and ends at 4.59pm the next day.

Unfortunately, there's no consensus on the best timing (probably because the entire thing is totally fabricated?).

Here's a Li Chun chart grabbed off the totally legit Fengshui Beginner. (Legend: $$ = most auspicious time to deposit cash. $ = also acceptable time. X = inauspicious time, avoid.)

Li Chun Day 1 — 4 Feb 2020 (5.18pm onwards) Li Chun Day 2 — 5 Feb 2020 (before 5pm) 5.18pm to 7.59pm 8pm to 9.59pm 10pm to 10.59pm 7am to 8.59am 9am to 10.59am 11am to 12.59pm 1pm to 2.59pm 3pm to 4.59pm Rat 鼠 X $ $ $$ $ X X $$ Ox 牛 $$ X $ $ $ X X $ Tiger 虎 $ $$ $$ $ X $$ $ X Rabbit 兔 X $$ $$ $$ $ $ $ $ Dragon 龙 $$ X $ X $ $ $$ $$ Snake 蛇 $$ $ X $$ X $ $ $$ Horse 马 $ $$ X $ $$ X $ $$ Sheep 羊 $ X $$ $$ $$ $$ $ $ Monkey 猴 $ $ X $$ X $ $ $ Rooster 鸡 $ X $ $$ $ $$ $ $ Dog 狗 $ $$ $ X $ $ X $ Pig 猪 $ $ X $ X $$ $ X
