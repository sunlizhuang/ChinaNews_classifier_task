Walk into Room 307 of Webster Hall, and the first thing you’ll notice—or won’t be able to ignore—is that no patch of the wall is left unadorned. Posters cover every inch of upper Adam Tuchler’s room. “I got in trouble with campus safety for having more than 50% of my wall covered … It’s kind of excessive—I even covered my window,” Tuchler said.



Tuchler’s redecoration began with some frustration over the standard Academy dorm room. “I put up posters because I didn’t like the blank walls. They made my room dull,” he recalled. “I already had some posters from home—I got them in fourth grade, so I got to work.”



While they offer some insight into who he is, Tuchler’s anime posters serve less as an expression of his current interests than a reminder of home. “When I see them, I feel closer to my hometown of Chicago, my family and the memories of my childhood,” Tuchler said. “I don’t watch anime anymore—make sure that gets in there. Regardless, I still think the posters show who I was and give me a sense of nostalgia.”



An avid traveler, Adam collected many of these posters from his trips to China and Japan. “I haggled two from merchants by the Great Wall and a couple more from a souvenir shop in Tokyo,” he noted.



Tuchler’s posters are not the only decorative items in his room. Anime prints lie on his dresser-top, accompanied by a friend’s souvenir from China. “I got the fan as a gift from a friend,” he said.



Two sofas and rugs also make for an inviting hangout spot. “I try to make it as homey as I can,” Tuchler said. “My friends can just walk in and sit on the couch, do work here or hang out. I think my room is a good place for people to relax.” This purposeful design reflects of Tuchler himself—a naturally outgoing presence in his dorm and beyond.



With the 28 posters, displayed across the walls, Adam displays his personality through his room decor—while providing a colorful, personal environment for both himself and friends to inhabit.
