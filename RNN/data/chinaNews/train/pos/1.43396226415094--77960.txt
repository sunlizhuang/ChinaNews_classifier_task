With advancements in innovation in the field of microelectronics such as low weight antennas, apertures, control sensors, panels, trans-receivers, and actuators in small satellites and the increasing need for earth observation service for sectors such as agriculture, defense, energy, communication, scientific research, and space exploration, governments and private companies are investing in these satellites.

This is expected to drive the market for small satellites over the forecast period.

The small satellite market is projected to show high growth due to the increasing demand in recent years for high-resolution imagery services. The government is expected to drive the growth of the small satellite market by increasing demand from end-use industries including commercial, civil, defense.

This sector has seen a number of key innovations in major companies including Airbus Defense and Space, Aerospace Corporation, Boeing, EchoStar Corporation, Harris Corporation, Eutel-sat Communications S.A., Geo-optics Inc., and others with an emphasis on both organic and inorganic growth strategies. In some of the main economies, emerging regions like the Asia Pacific and the Middle East were among the high potential markets with high growth in the forecast year.

Based on type, the nanosatellite segment is projected to grow at the fastest rate over the forecast period. This is due to the growing need for nanosatellites in earth observation applications and increased investments in advanced nanosatellite technologies. Based on the application, the satellite communications segment is projected to be the fastest-growing application over the forecast period. This is attributed to rising in demand for small satellites in military applications and navigations, radio broadcasting, and others.

Important Developments:

• In February 2016, The U.K. received an order from Airbus Defense and Space Defense Ministry for the manufacture and operation of two Zephyr 8 solar-powered craft pseudo-satellite (HAPS) high altitude.

• In Nov 2014, the subsidiary of OHB AG, CGS S.p.a, has signed an agreement with Airbus Defense and Space for the realization of the MicroWave Imager (MWI) device for second-generation MetOp satellites. CGS will be responsible for designing and developing the MWI instrument from phase B2 until the final verification of the three flight modes in orbit.

Strategic Factors Impacting Market Growth:

• Rising demand for high-resolution imaging services

• Rising government investments in the small satellite market

• Rising demand for small satellites in emerging economies

• Low cost of components and diversified application scope to increase their acceptance

North America is a dedicated user of small satellites and the US-based companies and universities make many regular launches each year. The United States Commission has approved licenses for various commercial constellations of Earth Exploration Satellite Services (EESS), which operate small satellites based on the Cubesat model. Small satellites are also used by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to conduct advanced exploration, scientific research, and educational research, and to demonstrate newly emerging technologies.

The demand for small satellites is increasingly moving from North America to the Asia-Pacific region, where significant investments are being directed by countries such as China, India, and Japan to increase the space-based capabilities of the region. China has been creating a safe climate to speed up the space economy. In 2018, China performed about 39 launch missions and accounted for more than 33 percent of global launches. The nation plans to launch about 100 satellites by 2025 according to the China National Space Administration. Since 2015, several new startups have emerged focusing on reinventing India's small satellite market. Exceed Space, for example, launched a nano-satellite called Exseed SAT 1 in December 2018 to provide essential communication for amateur radio.
