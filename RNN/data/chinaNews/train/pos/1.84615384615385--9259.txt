(Bloomberg) — A container with 23.94 tons of American chicken feet cleared Chinese customs Tuesday, potentially heralding the start of a new trading era between the two countries just days before they sign a long-awaited trade deal. The chicken feet, or phoenix claws as they’re known in Chinese recipes, were inspected and approved for unloading by customs in Shanghai, the official Securities Times reported. The event marks the return of U.S. poultry meat to China five years after it was banned, it said.

Pretty sad affair when Bloomberg writes about chicken feet as the savior of America…

In Russia years ago they had Bush Legs…

“Bush legs” (Russian: ножки Буша nozhki Busha) is a prevailing term in the post-Soviet states that denotes chicken leg quarters from the United States. The expression first appeared in 1990 when Mikhail Gorbachev and George H. W. Bush signed a trade agreement about delivery of frozen chicken leg quarters to the USSR. In those times the USSR was experiencing food shortages and “Bush legs” enjoyed wide popularity.

Except Wikipedia is kinda lying. The Russians laughed at the Bush Legs and we now do not have them anymore. Russia is self-sufficient in chicken and selling it to the world even…

I really doubt if Chicken feet will save America….but use what you can to push the hope up!

Maybe I need to do a Phoenix Feet (Chicken Feet and or Trump Feet) Recipe…

For the sake of easy to remember; just call then “Trump Feet”…

Have a nice day…
