(CNN) â€” Panda brothers Pit and Paule took their first steps outside Wednesday with their mother Meng Meng at Zoo Berlin. The twins -- the first pandas ever to be born in Germany -- are on view to the public for the first time on Thursday.

The pair, who also have Chinese names, were born on August 31, 2019.

Pit (Meng Xiang) is "laid-back, dreamy and always ready for a nap," according to Zoo Berlin's website. Paule (Meng Yuan) is 48 minutes younger than his more sedate sibling and "known for his mischievous, inquisitive nature."

Brother Pit will give Paule a loud yelp when his younger brother gets too rough and tumble, the zoo noted.

"On this special day I would particularly like to thank the Zoo's committed team of keepers, vets and biologists," said Zoo and Tierpark Director Dr. Andreas Knieriem in a statement. "But I am also grateful to everyone else who contributed to the successful breeding of these wonderful bears here at Zoo Berlin."

The twins' parents -- mother Meng Meng and father Jiao Qing -- arrived in Germany in summer 2017. They're on loan from China for a fee that goes toward conservation work.
