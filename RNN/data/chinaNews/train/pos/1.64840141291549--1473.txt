GUANGZHOU, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- The freight volume of south China's Pearl River exceeded 1 billion tonnes in 2019, setting a new record, second only to that of Yangtze River in China, official statistics showed Tuesday.

According to the Pearl River Administration of Navigational Affairs under the Ministry of Transport, the river's freight volume, which ranks second in the world, increased by 5.5 percent year on year in 2019. The container throughput on the river hit 14 million TEU in the period, up 13.4 percent year on year.

In 2019, 53 water transport projects were under construction on the river, including ports, shipping channels and facilities, with a total investment of 62 billion yuan (about 8.92 billion U.S. dollars).
