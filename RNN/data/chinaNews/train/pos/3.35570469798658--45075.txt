No Pakistani allowed to travel back from China till completion of 14-day quarantine

Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Health Dr Zafar Mirza has announced no Pakistani will be allowed to travel back to the country from China till they complete a 14-day observation period.

The SAPM, while addressing a press conference in Islamabad on Saturday, said that the agreement in this regard had been finalised in a meeting held with the Chinese envoy in Pakistan.

Mirza said that the policy is being implemented after China declared that no Chinese citizen will be allowed to travel abroad unless he passes through the 14-day observation period.

"Those declared free of the virus after the period will be issued a certificate to assure the airport officials of the same," Mirza said.

â€œThrough this single measure we seek to ensure that Pakistan remains free from the disease," said the SAPM.
