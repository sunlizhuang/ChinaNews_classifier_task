Just six months after its inaugural service with Shanghai Airlines took off, Budapest Airport has announced the addition of two other Chinese destinations on its route map. Following exceptional success at the Hungarian gateway, the subsidiary of China Eastern Airlines is now operating daily to Shanghai with twice-weekly links to include services via Chengdu and Xian.

Offering 207,000 annual seats with Shanghai Airlines, the carrier recorded an extraordinary 230% jump from 2019. As Chengdu and Xian enter Budapest’s route map, the capital city airport will operate six non-stop links to the East Asian country this year. These services join Beijing (Air China), Chongqing (Hainan Airlines), Sanya (launching in February with Sunday Airlines), and Shanghai.

Dr. Rolf Schnitzler, CEO of Budapest Airport said: “With an 18% year-on-year growth in passengers between Budapest and China, Shanghai Airlines’ new connections play an important role in the positive partnership between the two countries.”
