The Chinese auto glass maker Fuyao has announced a 46 million dollar expansion of its plant in Moraine, adding 100 jobs.

Ohio Public Radio's Karen Kasler reports.

Fuyao has invested $600 million into the plant since 2014, six years after GM shut it down and 2,000 workers lost their jobs. Governor Mike DeWine says these 100 new employees will join the 2,300 workers at Fuyao. And he’s hoping for more.

“We asked the chairman to spread the good news among his friends and Chinese companies, because we certainly welcome investment in the Miami Valley, we welcome investment in the state of Ohio.”

Fuyao has grown quickly, and was fined more than $724,000 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration over the summer for multiple health and safety hazards. But the company has said it’s “laser focused” on worker safety and product quality.
