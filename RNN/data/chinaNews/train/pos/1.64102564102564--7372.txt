The first completed generic hull of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel built under SBM Offshore’s Fast4Ward concept has arrived in Singapore, ahead of deployment on ExxonMobil's prolific Stabroek block off Guyana

After a journey of some 4260 kilometres, the hull of the Liza Unity FPSO arrived at Keppel Shipyard in Singapore from China, the Dutch floater player said.

This is SBM’s first generic hull, the multi-purpose floater (MPF1) in its series of Fast4Ward hulls currently under construction.

This first newbuild hull was completed by Chinese yard Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding (SWS) in December. SWS said that the first Fast4Ward hull is expected to become the “reference” FPSO in the international offshore equipment market.

“The hull’s arrival represents a significant milestone on the path to delivering the company’s first standardised FPSO,” SBM said. Check out a video of the arrival here:

The hull was completed in less than two years from first steel cut in March 2018.

The MPF1 hull was allocated to the Liza Unity FPSO for offshore Guyana, following a final investment decision by supermajor ExxonMobil in May last year.

“This milestone is in line with our client’s project schedule, which targets Liza Phase 2 start-up in early 2022,” SBM added.

The Liza Unity is the first of three similar hulls SBM has contracted SWS to build. The second unit is under construction in the dry dock and steel cutting of the third unit is scheduled for next year.

SBM also signed contracts for the construction of its fourth and fifth hulls under its purchase programme for Fast4Ward new build multi-purpose hulls.

The contracts were signed with SWS and China Merchants Industry Holdings (CMIH). Both yards are also progressing the construction of SBM’s first three hulls which are already allocated to projects.
