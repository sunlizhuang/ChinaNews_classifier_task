Only in an upside down world, would we pay Brazil to drill while turning away the Canadians who will now sell their oil to China. The AP reported on Friday that Brazil has leaked almost 110,000 gallons of oil, 2600 barrels, into the Atlantic Ocean because of an offshore Chevron drilling site.

President Obama has placed a moratorium on our drilling for the protection of the environment, but he doesn’t seem to see the conflict in not protecting the environment in other countries.

Remember when he said the following while giving Brazil $2 billion of our taxpayer dollars –

“We want to help you with the technology and support to develop these oil reserves safely. And when you’re ready to start selling, we want to be one of your best customers.”
