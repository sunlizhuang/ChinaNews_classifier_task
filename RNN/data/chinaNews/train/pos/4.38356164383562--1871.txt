BEIJING: Chinese President Xi Jinping said Kiribati’s President Taneti Mamau and his country stand on the right side of history by resuming diplomatic ties with China.

Xi made the remarks when holding talks with Mamau at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

China and Kiribati resumed diplomatic relations in September 2019 on the basis of the one-China policy, opening a new chapter for bilateral ties, said Xi.





“Mr. President and the Kiribati government stand on the right side of history,” Xi told Mamau, adding that the resumption “fully embodies their strategic vision and political courage. China speaks highly of the decision,” said Xi.

Since the resumption of diplomatic ties, China and Kiribati have conducted numerous exchanges in different areas and at different levels with fruitful results, he said.

Facts proved that it is in the interests of both peoples to restore diplomatic ties, and the bilateral ties enjoy broad prospects, said Xi.

Calling Mamau’s visit to China “an important landmark in China-Kiribati ties,” Xi said China stands ready to work with the Pacific island country to promote bilateral ties to a new level.

Xi called on both countries to deepen mutual political understanding, saying that China has always held that all countries, no matter big or small, should be equal and all countries should respect one another’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

China sticks to the path of peaceful development and respects Kiribati’s choice of a development path that suits its own national situation, Xi said.

Xi said the two countries should expand pragmatic cooperation by seeking the synergy of the Belt and Road Initiative with Kiribati’s development plans.

China will encourage more Chinese enterprises to invest in Kiribati, said Xi, adding that China has approved the listing of Kiribati as a destination for Chinese tour groups.
