Trippie Redd scored his first No. 1 Billboard album with his vulnerable and emotional 21-track A Love Letter to You 4. The deeply honest album showcased the Canton, Ohio rapper’s balancing of superstardom and heartbreak in recent years. Trippie returns with the offering’s deluxe edition featuring an EP’s worth of new songs – eight tracks in total – and a bevy of A-list guest stars.

After debuting his collaboration with Young Thug for “YELL OH,” a steady flow of releases followed including a star vehicle for Russ in “The Way” and the acoustic-driven love declaration featuring Chance the Rapper in “I Love You.” Other standout guests include Lil Durk, Lil Tecca and Sahbabii. Trippie Redd is also slated to embark oin a month-long North American tour starting February 22 in Philadelphia and rapping up in Los Angeles on March 15. See the full tour dates below.
