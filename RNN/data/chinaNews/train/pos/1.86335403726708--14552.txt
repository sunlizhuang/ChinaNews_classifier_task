The story-tellers include Christopher Nixon Cox, grandson of former U.S. President Richard Nixon; Stephen Orlins, president of the National Committee on United States-China Relations, and Neil Mallon Bush, son of former U.S. President George H. Bush.

Wang Donghua, Chinese Consul General in San Francisco, attended the event and said the documentary gives the American people an opportunity to learn more about China, review the history of China-U.S. relations, reflect on the most prominent issues in the bilateral ties, and explore means to resolving their differences.

To develop sound China-U.S. relations conforms to the fundamental and long-term interests of both countries, and reflects the common aspirations of Chinese and American people, as well as the hopes of the rest of the world, Wang said.

"The documentary ... will promote understanding and friendship among people from the U.S. and China and ultimately connect both of our communities even more strongly," he said.
