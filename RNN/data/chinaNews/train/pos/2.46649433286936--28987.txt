Marylander Tested For Possible Coronavirus

A Maryland resident met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria to be tested for the new virus that originated in the central China city of Wuhan, Maryland Department of Health officials said Monday.

The person is in good condition and is being monitored while awaiting coronavirus test results from a CDC laboratory.

“The Maryland Department of Health is closely monitoring the rapidly changing situation with 2019 N-CoV, both in the U.S. and in China,” MDH Deputy Secretary of Public Health Fran Phillips said in a statement. “As we learn more, Marylanders are encouraged to practice everyday actions to promote good health and to protect yourself and your loved ones from respiratory viruses like the coronavirus — wash your hands thoroughly, cover your cough and avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home from work or school if you’re not feeling well.”

China has confirmed more than 2,700 cases, with 81 deaths. So far, more than 40 cases have been confirmed elsewhere, including two in Southern California and one each in Washington state, Chicago and Arizona.

An inbound Southwest Airlines flight from Las Vegas was stopped at BWI Marshall Airport on Saturday when someone onboard was apparently sick. The carrier said it followed CDC recommendations for airlines.
