Dublin, Feb. 25, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Global Microgrid Monitoring System Market, By Grid Type (On grid & Off-grid), By Component (Hardware & Software), By Ownership (Public & Private), By End-user, By Region, Competition, Forecast & Opportunities, 2024" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.



The Global Microgrid Monitoring System Market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of over 11% during 2019-2024, owing to increasing demand for power, rising emphasis on alternative energy production, improving and evolving technologies, refurbishment of ageing infrastructure, and investments in smart grids and energy systems.



Increasing investments in transmission & distribution infrastructure and massive investments in smart grids and energy systems, globally, would further drive the Global Microgrid Monitoring System Market during the forecast period.



In terms of component, hardware segment is expected to grow at the fastest rate during 2019-2024. The hardware components of microgrid monitoring system include physical components such as CPU module, digital input module, digital output module, analog input/output module, local Controller, data logger, data recorder, relays, meters and communication network. The increasing number of microgrid projects in large power plants and high demand from process industries such as manufacturing, oil & gas, mining, steel and chemicals would further drive the hardware segment of the microgrid monitoring system market.



Asia-Pacific accounted for a significant portion of the Global Microgrid Monitoring System Market in 2018 and is expected to register strong growth during forecast period as well, on the back of increasing investments in grid expansion projects by developing nations such as China and India to boost their distribution grid reliability. Among the countries in the region, China was the largest market for microgrid monitoring system in 2018. China has the highest installed power generation and distribution capacities, which is turn is resulting in huge demand for microgrid monitoring system.



The Global Microgrid Monitoring System Market is characterized by a diverse group of regional and international manufacturers. The market for microgrid monitoring system is moderately fragmented in nature. There is very minimal product differentiation which induces vendors to retain their market shares by pricing their products and services competitively. Additionally, established international vendors face intense competition from regional vendors which provide customers with comparatively low-priced and customized products.



Some of the major companies operating in the Global Microgrid Monitoring System Market are Siemens, General Electric Company, ABB, Schneider Electric, Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories and Emerson.
