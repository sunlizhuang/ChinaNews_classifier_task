BEIJING, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- The fifth International Taoist Forum will be held in early May in a famous Taoist mountain in east China's Jiangsu Province, the organizer said Wednesday.

Jointly hosted by the Chinese Taoist Association and the China Religious Culture Communication Association, this year's forum will focus on how Taoism can keep up with the times and contribute to social progress.

By introducing the development of Taoism in China and facilitating communication on the subject, the forum is expected to better explain religious affairs in China to the world, according to the organizer.

Taoism is a 2,000-year-old religion that originated from Lao Tze's philosophy.

Previous forums were held in 2007, 2011, 2014 and 2017 in different locations.
