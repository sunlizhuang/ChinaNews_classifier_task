A red heart-shaped kite bearing the yellow characters “Zhongguo Jiayou”, meaning “China, stay strong” in English, stole the show at the Otaki Kite Festival, held from Feb 8-9 on the Otaki Beach in Wellington, New Zealand.

The kite, made by local Chinese communities under the initiative of the Chinese Cultural Center in Wellington, shows the strong confidence of Chinese people around the world that the nation will prevail over the coronavirus outbreak that is disrupting the country.
