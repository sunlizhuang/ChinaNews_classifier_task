This week at CES in Las Vegas, Audi gave hands-on demonstrations of its newest concept car, a self-driving vehicle called AI:Me, or ‘Amy.’

The German luxury car manufacturer describes AI:Me as an ‘empathetic mobility partner’ that will transport passengers into ‘an oasis of calm’ while the car’s autonomous navigation system cuts through stressful city traffic.

AI:Me was built with a compact frame that was specifically designed to be able to move through high-traffic urban spaces and fit into tight parking spots.

Its roomy interior cabin was designed to give passengers the option to forget about big city anxiety and focus on inner tranquility and self-care.

AI:Me actually features a ‘Well-Being’ mode that allows users to customize light levels, dampen noise from outside the car, and ‘purify’ the air inside the cabin.

The cabin itself was designed to emphasize natural materials, including a long wooden dashboard that can function as a table or small desk space, and carpets that are made from recycled fishnets found on the seafloor.

‘We brought the nature from outside in the inside’ Audi’s Simona Falcinella said last year when AI:Me was first revealed in Shanghai.

The car’s UI was designed to be controlled through a blend of voice commands, gestures, and eyetracking, through which passengers can make a selection on the car’s control screen by looking at it

The car will also come with a built-in VR headset and several custom designed VR experiences to help pass the time during stressful trips

‘The colors and the material give you a lot of light and a lot of space feeling.”

AI:Me will also feature an advanced UI system that will let passengers change the car’s interior settings and even ask for a snack from a hidden food compartment.

WHAT IS THE AUDI AI:ME? The Audi AI:Me (pronounced 'Amy') is a new concept car from the German car manufacturer. The self-driving car emphasizes passengers calmness and tranquility. It was designed on a compact frame and intended for busy city driving. However, the interior was designed to be 'an oasis of calm.' The car features a 'Well-Being' mode that will dampen outside noise, purify cabin air, and dim the interior lights.

The front dashboard features a long black screen that will respond to voice commands, gestures, or even eyetracking, letting them select an option on the screen by looking at it for a few seconds.

The car will also come equipped with a virtual reality headset that will work with a number of custom designed experiences meant to help passengers stay calm in traffic.

In one demo, described by Engadget, passengers will be able to imagine they’re flying in a helicopter above a city in China, with the movements of the helicopter synchronized to the movement of the car.

Audi hasn’t announced any pricing or release date information.
