From smoking cannabis during a podcast to performing rap singles about the gorilla Harambe, Elon Musk is known for his weird and wonderful stunts.

Now, the Tesla CEO has performed a bizarre dance on stage, and even declared it ‘not suitable for work.’

Musk performed the strange dance during a ceremony at a new multibillion-dollar Tesla plant near Shanghai.

Axwell and Ingrosso’s song ‘More Than You Know’ was played on stage, at which point Musk broke into a dance, even throwing his jacket off at one point.

Musk has now tweeted a clip of the dance, writing: “At Tesla Giga Shanghai NSFW!!”

Unsurprisingly, many Tesla fans have replied to the tweet, with many joking about Musk’s ‘clumsy’ moves.

One user said: “Peak Dad dancing,” while another added: “Should’ve taken it all off.”

Meanwhile, others suggested that the striptease could be the start of a new career for Musk, with one suggesting that he ‘quit Tesla and become a stripper.”

And hilariously, one user compared Musk’s awkward moves to the hilarious Windows 95 launch dance, in which Bill Gates danced alongside several other Microsoft executives.

Musk was in Shanghai to open Tesla's new plant, which is developing the first China-made Model 3 Teslas.

Speaking to the South China Morning Post, Allan Wang, general manager at Tesla China, said: "The demand for our locally-built model 3 is very good.

"We are confident about selling all vehicles manufactured in this factory.”
