MANILA - A Chinese Coast Guard ship docked at the port of Manila on Monday for a goodwill visit, officials said.

Beijing's embassy in Manila earlier said the week-long visit aims to "demonstrate goodwill, deepen mutual understanding and trust as well as enhance friendship and cooperation."

The Chinese Coast Guard was welcomed by its counterpart led by Philippine Coast Guard commandant Admiral Joel Garcia.

"This is the first time in history that the PCG and CCG formally sit down and talk to enhance relationship and establish smooth coordination," he said.

The two nations are expected to exchange information on maritime affairs and law enforcement, and conduct cross-deck visits, joint search and rescue and firefight exercises before the Chinese Coast Guard leaves the country on Friday.

Manila and Beijing will hold its third meeting of the Joint Coast Guard Committee on Tuesday until Thursday.

The visit comes amid Beijing's sweeping claim of the South China Sea, including waters close to Philippine shores, and its rejection of a UN-backed international tribunal ruling that invalidated its claims in the disputed waters.
