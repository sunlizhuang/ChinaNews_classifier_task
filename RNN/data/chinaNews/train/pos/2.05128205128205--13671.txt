Speaking at the launching ceremony held in the China Cultural Center in Fiji, Chinese Ambassador to Fiji Qian Bo highlighted the importance of the stamp launching, saying that "the zodiac stamps have witnessed the friendship between China and Fiji, deepening cultural exchange between our people."

For his part, Joseph Nand, the assistant minister of the Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts, said that launching the stamps is an event that reflects the strong relationship shared by the China Cultural Center in Fiji and the ministry.
