Until this week, all samples taken from people suspected of having the virus in Northern Ireland were sent to England for testing, but the new local facility will speed up results."A helpline has also been established for anyone in Northern Ireland who has travelled to China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Macau in the past 14 days. The helpline number is 0300 200 7885 and is available 24/7."To help reduce any potential spread of coronavirus, we are urging people to follow the steps that we recommend for similar illnesses such as cold and flu â€“ catch it, bin it, kill it. Always carry tissues to catch your cough or sneeze, dispose of the tissue as soon as possible after using it, and clean your hands as soon as you can as germs can spread to every surface you touch."Those who have travelled to the aforementioned areas should stay indoors and avoid contact with others for at least 14 days after they arrive. They should also contact their GP by phone and are advised not to attend a surgery or hospital without phoning ahead.Anyone who is not registered with a GP is advised to contact their local Emergency Department.(JG/MH)
