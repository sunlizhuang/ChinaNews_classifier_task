After a five-year stint on the board of directors of the Nebraska Pork Producers Association, John Csukker has been elevated to the board’s highest position: President.

Csukker, who works in Columbus as the environmental senior services manager for The Maschhoffs, was sworn in as the organization’s president last week at the group’s annual meeting in Lincoln. Csukker had served as a president-elect in 2019 and had moved up the ranks as his peers took notice. During his time on the board, Csukker has served the interests of Nebraska’s pork producers throughout the country and around the world, through trips to Mexico, Shanghai and Hong Kong. He has also helped to lobby for pork interests to Nebraska’s congressional delegation in Washington D.C.

Csukker had never assumed that he would be president or leader of anything when he first started working in the pork business nearly 30 years ago. But, as he continued to move up the ranks during his career, he said he felt that he wanted to give something back to his fellow pork producers. Thus, he decided to join the NPPA Board of Directors, putting him within a stone’s throw of the leadership.
