On Feb 19, Zhang Heqing, cultural counselor of the Chinese embassy in Pakistan, visited Muhammad Khalily, vice president of the International Islamic University in Islamabad.

“Pakistanis are Chinese people’s good friends and brothers. Therefore, Pakistan will fully back China, who is battling against the coronavirus outbreak,” Khalily said.

Zhang thanked the Pakistani government and people for their solid and generous support for China, and briefed the vice president on how the Chinese government is tackling the epidemic.

“The measures adopted to contain the virus has proven effective, as the number of new cases of coronavirus-related pneumonia outside Hubei province has been on the decline over the past fortnight,” Zhang said.

Khalily responded that he firmly believed China will prevail against the epidemic because of its strong leadership, excellent political system and scientific governing strategies.

In addition, Zhang expressed gratitude to the International Islamic University for providing Chinese students a safe and sound environment for their studies and lives amid the outbreak.
