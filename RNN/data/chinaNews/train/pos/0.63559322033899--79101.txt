‘Mapping Digital Game Culture in China brings refreshing cultural studies perspectives to China studies by analyzing competing narratives about digital gaming and the contested ideological forces that give rise to them. Szablewicz’s innovative approach generates unique insights into a new media and popular cultural phenomenon with latent political implications. Her rich ethnography invites us to more critically reflect on a historical period of dramatic economic, cultural, and technological changes within China and beyond.’

‘This is a must-read for anyone interested in youth, video games, and internet culture in contemporary China. Based on first-hand, ethnographic research, the book explores key issues in China today, from internet addiction, to e-sports, to video game cafes in the rapidly changing urban landscapes of a country at the center of global technological and cultural change. To know young people in China today, we need to understand their diverse relationships to the cultural powerhouse that the Internet and video games have become.'
