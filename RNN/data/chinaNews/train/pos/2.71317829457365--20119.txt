A GROUP of 27 supporters of Llandudno’s St David’s Hospice plan to trek along the Great Wall of China to raise funds for Llandudno’s St David’s Hospice.

The group has a target of raising £50,000 for the charity and will be taking a nine day trip to explore the enormous structure. On one day they will face the challenge of climbing the 1,000 steps that make up the Heavenly Ladder.

One of the group, 51 year old Michelle Gollins, a former pupil of Ysgol Bryn Elian, will be walking in memory of Christine Pike, who died away at St David’s.

Michelle said: “My mum Helena encouraged me to enter this challenge for St David's Hospice because of their care given to Christine.

"She was a good friend of my mum’s and a long term family friend. I have fond memories of Christine. She was a hairdresser and cut my hair as a little girl.

"When I got married, she and her husband Alan drove me and my bridesmaids to my wedding in their classic cars. Mum visited Christine when she was poorly in St David’s. She was impressed by the care and compassion given by staff and volunteers”.

The hospice supports local people at its inpatient unit in Llandudno, therapy centres in Bangor and Llandudno, and in the comfort of patient’s own homes via their Hospice at Home and Outreach services.

The Hospice services are free of charge to patients and their families.
