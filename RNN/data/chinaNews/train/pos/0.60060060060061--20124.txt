A health worker who battled two life changing illnesses is to trek across China in aid of sick children in the north.

Linda Laing-Gordon from Inverness began experiencing health problems in 2003 after a horrific car crash left her with a broken leg and a collapsed lung.

After a week in hospital her health took a drastic turn when she suffered two stokes which limited movement on the right side of her body.

A decade later, then 49, she found a lump in her breast, leading to a devastating cancer diagnosis.

She said: “It was a long haul on both my traumas. I found it hard to believe it was happening to me, wondering why and automatically assuming the worst.

“Each time I was going through a mix of emotions. It was also awful for my family and friends watching on knowing there is nothing they can do.

“What happened completely changed my life but it has made me more grateful for what I have.

“It has made me totally re-evaluate my life and now I enjoy it as much as I can.”

As the 56-year-old embraces life to the full, she is preparing to join 15 fellow adventurers as part of The Archie Foundation’s China Trek in May.

During the nine-day-trip, she will travel to Beijing then on to one of the Seven Wonders of the World to help raise £4,200 for the charity.

She added: “I wanted to do the Trek as I think it will be a mega challenge on my stamina and also I love being outside and walking. I am such a positive and happy person and am looking forward to meeting people and making new friends.

“I would also like to help the sick children in our area as I was lucky with my care and would love for the children to get the same.”
