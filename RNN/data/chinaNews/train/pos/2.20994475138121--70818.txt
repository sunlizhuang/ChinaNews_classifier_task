The police have appointed Normah Ishak to succeed Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay as the principal assistant director of the Special Branch’s Counter-Terrorism Division, becoming the first woman to hold the post.

South China Morning Post quoted Inspector-General of Police Abdul Hamid Bador confirming her appointment today.

The report said Hamid described Normah, who was Ayob Khan’s deputy since 2016, as “gutsy, brainy, highly qualified and an experienced officer of very high integrity and an excellent commander”.

She joined the police force in December 1991, the report said.

Ayob Khan has been appointed as the new Johor police chief effective March 6.

Abdul Hamid had said Ayob Khan has held his position as Bukit Aman’s counterterrorism head for too long and should be given the opportunity to be exposed to other types of police work.

"He has been (in his position) for too long. If I let him there for the next one or two months, people will call him 'Ayob Terrorist' because that's what he's been doing (catching terrorists)," he told reporters last Friday.
