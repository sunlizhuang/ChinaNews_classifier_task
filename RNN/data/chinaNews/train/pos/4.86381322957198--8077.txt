The Guangdong Provincial People's Congress began in Guangzhou today with calls for greater integration of Hong Kong into the Greater Bay area, but the media from the SAR were not allowed to cover the event.

Journalists from several Hong Kong media outlets, including RTHK, were not invited to cover the Guangdong congress this time.

Responding to RTHK's enquiry on why the practice of allowing media organizations apply for press access was changed to invitation-only coverage this time, the Guangdong government's information office said arrangements differ from year to year.

It also said the officials were not sure about the invitation criteria for media representatives.

At the opening ceremony, Guangdong governor Ma Xinrui unveiled a series of plans to integrate Hong Kong and Macau into the Greater Bay Area, including new border facilities and transport infrastructure.

Highlighting his work plan for the year, Ma said Guangdong will work with Hong Kong and Macau on building a "world-class" innovation platform and an influential technology innovation centre.

He said efforts will also be dedicated to boosting connectivity with the two special administrative regions and building new transport infrastructure.

He added that the provincial government will encourage people from Hong Kong and Macau to start businesses. They will also give all residents from the two SARs living in Guangdong the benefits enjoyed by local residents.

Ma said cooperation between the province, Hong Kong and Macau should be also extended to education and medical sectors.
