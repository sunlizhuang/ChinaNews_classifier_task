KUNMING, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, has urged good communication of the adaptation of Marxism to the Chinese context.

Xi made the remarks on Sunday afternoon as he visited the old town of Heshun on an inspection tour to southwest China's Yunnan Province ahead of the Chinese New Year.

He went to the memorial hall of Ai Siqi and learned about Ai's contributions to promoting the Party's theories, popularizing Marxism in China and adapting it with Chinese characteristics.

Xi called on nurturing people like Ai and using popular, easy-to-understand ways to spread Marxism.
