Former de facto law minister Zaid Ibrahim already has a plan to win Kelantanese over to DAP despite the state being considered a long-time PAS stronghold.

Outlining his plan to Malaysiakini, the new Kelantan DAP pro-tem chairperson said the main goal was to show the people that their lives can improve with better leaders in place.

Leaders such as those in the DAP, he said.

“Kelantanese are not that different from those in other places. They too want good leaders, good government, good local council, good water supply and they want to pay reasonable rates.

“DAP is a party which has by and large good competent leaders and administrators.

“My plan is to impress (upon) the people that their lives can be better with good leaders. I don’t have any other magic plan,” the former federal minister said when contacted.

The former Umno Kota Bahru MP who hails from Kelantan, however, acknowledged that he must first overcome the prejudice against DAP in the PAS-led state.

“I am reasonably confident I can engage with them (Kelantanese). I have dealt with them reasonably.

“(...) If we care enough about the people we don’t need to promise heaven and earth. Just promise them a better government,” he said.

Zaid’s appointment as the chairperson was announced yesterday, along with the appointment of 16 other pro-tem committee members.

He said the formation of a pro-tem committee was a step in strengthening the party’s position in Kelantan.

This includes providing explanations to the rakyat’s concerns, specifically to Malays there. DAP, he added, should also provide better responses to accusations such as it is a Chinese or communist party.
