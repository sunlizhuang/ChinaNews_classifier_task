The award-winning UK publisher Liverpool University Press (LUP) and the largest international joint venture university in China, Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) based in Suzhou, are delighted to announce the launch of a new imprint.

The XJTLU imprint, which will begin publishing in 2020, will span both books and journals and will provide a distinctive approach to the humanities and social sciences.

Professor David Goodman, Vice President for academic affairs at XJTLU, said that as a top joint-venture university in China, XJTLU is well-situated to become world-leading in intellectual exchange between China and the rest of the world.

He said: “To this end, a central aim of the imprint will be to facilitate academic dialogue between China and the Anglophone world, including translations of impactful Chinese academic works into English and translations of impactful English academic works into Chinese.”

Anthony Cond, LUP Managing Director said: “As a publisher of international repute for 120 years, and one with a long-standing commitment to exploring diverse languages and cultures, Liverpool University Press is ideally placed to work with XJTLU on both high quality print and innovative digital publications.”
