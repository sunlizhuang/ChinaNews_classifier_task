When National ripped of Eminem’s music for their political advert, National Party Campaign manager Steven Joyce defended the use as “Pretty legal“.

Turns out the SFO don’t consider ‘pretty legal’ as a defence…

SFO files criminal charges over National Party donations

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is pursuing criminal charges over an alleged $100,000 donation to National, but not against the party or its leader Simon Bridges.

…Let’s be clear, this is fucking enormous.

The SFO have traditionally run a thousand miles from ever getting involved in election donation issues and only press charges if they really have to, so they have clearly uncovered something and it’s rotten.

Of course, the real issue here isn’t so much how they laundered the money, the real issue here is how a rich Chinese businessmen openly asked to have two Chinese candidates bought and paid for on the National Party list.

This is a Party that already has an alleged Chinese spy in their caucus, many MPs have personal relationships with rich Chinese businessmen and Simon Bridges recently met the head of the Chinese secret police and praised them despite their Muslim concentration camps.

Sure, we should hold National to account for any breaches of law, but the real issue here is Beijing’s influence over the largest political party in NZ.
