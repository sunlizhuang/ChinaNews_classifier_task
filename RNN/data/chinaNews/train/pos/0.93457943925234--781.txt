Eight representatives of Alaskan pollock suppliers are in China on a ten-day trip to meet customers and drum up business, the Association of Genuine Alaska Pollock Producers (GAPP) said.

The trip will see the eight company representatives -- Jeffrey Welbourn and William Maio of Trident Seafoods, Margery Schelling and Jostein Rortveit of American Seafoods, Jason Martin of Golden Alaska Seafoods, Jacob Christensen of Arctic Storm Holding Company and the Central Bering Sea Fishermen’s Association's Jeffery Kauffman -- visit Shanghai, Qingdao and Beijing.

According to GAPP, the trip, which is partially funded through the Emerging Markets Program of the US Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service, will see attendees meet with representatives of US club store chains Sam's Club and Costco in Shanghai as well as "include time spent observing the popular e-commerce systems and meeting with Foreign Agricultural Service officials".

In Qingdao, the group will meet with surimi and fish sausage producers about new applications. In Beijing, the group will meet with US embassy staff and retailers, GAPP stated.

“China is a critically important export market for wild Alaska pollock and we’re eager to explore the market further and fully understand this market’s challenges and opportunities,” Craig Morris, GAPP's CEO said in the release.
