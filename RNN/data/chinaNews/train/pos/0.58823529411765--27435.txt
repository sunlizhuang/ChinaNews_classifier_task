SEPANG: Hotels and tour agents must alert the authorities should their clients, especially from China, show symptoms of the novel coronavirus, says Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad.

The Health Minister said it is important for operators to be vigilant and alert to the health condition of their clients.

"If there are those with symptoms, hotels and tour agents must inform health authorities.

"We will advise them what to do and the guests must be taken for medical attention," he said to reporters after visiting KL International Airport (KLIA) and KLIA2.

Malaysia, which is hosting Visit Malaysia Year 2020, is targetting a high number of tourist arrivals, including from China.

About 3.25 million Chinese tourists visited Malaysia last year.

Dr Dzulkefly said tourism operators should also have preventive measures by distributing masks and sanitisers to their guests and clients.

There are now four people - all Chinese nationals - who are confirmed to have been infected with the novel coronavirus in Malaysia.
