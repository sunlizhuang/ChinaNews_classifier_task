A woman who had traveled to Santa Clara County to visit family Jan. 23 from Wuhan, China is the ninth confirmed case in the United States, KNTV reports.

Already cases have been confirmed in Orange County, Los Angeles County and one previously in Santa Clara County.

Cases have also been confirmed in Illinois, Arizona, Massachusetts and Washington state, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A Boston man in his 20s had been diagnosed with the viral infection after he returned from a trip to Wuhan, where the outbreak began, health officials said Friday.

Last week, the WHO declared coronavirus a global health emergency and officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended travelers “avoid all nonessential travel to China.”

As of Sunday morning, more than 14,500 people have been diagnosed globally as having the coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization. In China, 304 people have died of the viral infection, the health agency reported.
