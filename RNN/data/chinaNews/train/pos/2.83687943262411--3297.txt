The governments of Mexico and China have agreed to jointly look into ways of developing the aquaculture industry in Mexico.

A main aim of the project is to build a solid aquaculture industrial base that will attract companies and investors.

The partnership is expected to result in the construction of a research center, as well as the development and sharing sources of knowledge.

Scientists and researchers from Mexico and China will meet regularly and are already eyeing issues, including production of fish feed, smolt and genetic development.

The Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean waters are seen as favorable areas for the development of aquaculture.

Yucatan state, which borders both sets of waters, is identified as an attractive region where aquaculture activities can be developed because of an extensive continental shelf and relatively low water depths.
