A female bodybuilder who brought the “Street Fighter” character Chun-Li to life by wearing cosplay is now in the front lines fighting to contain the novel coronavirus.

Yuan Herong, the muscular doctor from Shandong Province, China, shared her intentions in helping to fight the epidemic on Instagram.

“I’m a doctor,” she recently wrote, noting that she “must [be] on the front lines” to make a difference.

She also revealed some updates on the affected patients.

“171 cases of new pneumonia were cured and 15238 suspected cases were found,” she noted. “The healers are all treated through traditional Chinese medicine and other symptomatic treatment. We will try our best to do a good job in prevention and treatment.”

In another post, she wrote that she stays fit to keep herself safe from infection.

“In order to prevent infection after work, I still insist on fitness at home. Use cabbage as dumbbell,” she jokingly said.

Herong’s positive attitude is a welcome breath of fresh air amid the growing panic toward the outbreak currently spreading on social media.

The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or Wuhan coronavirus) has spread to 26 different countries and territories worldwide, with 9,936 confirmed cases and 213 deaths as of this writing.
