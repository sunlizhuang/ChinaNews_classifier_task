Sir David Attenborough will return to our screens in 2020 to present a new natural history series about the planet.



The show 'A Perfect Planet', is a five-part BBC One series will explore "the intricate systems" that allow Earth to thrive.



You can expect the stunning shots of nature and wildlife explored in the BBC previous nature documentaries as well as a closer exploration of animal stories.

From the white wolves of Ellesemere Island to bears in Kamchatka, vampire finches of the Galapagos to golden snub-nosed monkeys of China, the series will "combine a global view of the planet from space with intimate animal stories from the most spectacular habitats".



The show will also hold a spotlight on the environment and how humans are changing the Earth as we know it.



Sir David, 93, said: "Oceans, sunlight, weather and volcanoes - together these powerful yet fragile forces allow life to flourish in astonishing diversity.



"They make Earth truly unique - a perfect planet.



"Our planet is one in a billion, a world teeming with life.



"But now, a new dominant force is changing the face of Earth: Humans. To preserve our perfect planet we must ensure we become a force for good."

BBC director of content Charlotte Moore said: "BBC One continues to lead the way in natural history programming, and I'm thrilled that Sir David Attenborough will be our trusted guide to A Perfect Planet.



"It will be a breathtaking series celebrating the intricate systems that allow our planet to thrive, bringing together a unique perspective with groundbreaking camera technology."



A Perfect Planet is a Silverback Films Production for BBC and Discovery.



It will air on BBC One later this year.
