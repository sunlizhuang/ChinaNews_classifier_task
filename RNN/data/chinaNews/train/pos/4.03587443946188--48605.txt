Kochi-based Entri, a local language learning app, has raised a seed funding of $1.4 million led by Good Capital, an early-stage venture investment firm.

The round also saw participation from investors in the US and China.

Good Capital partner Arjun Malhotra said, “Starting with the 100 million people who apply for government jobs every year, Entri is expanding the universe of employable candidates by skilling people in their own language, as it should be.”

Founded in 2017 by Mohammed Hisamuddin and Rahul Ramesh, Entri started by providing a database of questions for government recruitment exams in Malayalam. It recently added languages like Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, and Hindi, and claims to be adding 6,000 users every day.

The startup said it is on track to reach five million users in the next 12 months.
