Amitabh Bachchan-starrer Aankhen, a heist-thriller film directed by Vipul Shah and produced by Gaurang Doshi, is an all-time classic film. The film released in 2002, which also starred Akshay Kumar, Sushmita Sen, Arjun Rampal, and Paresh Rawal, has been in the news for quite some time now for its sequel. While there is no final confirmation on the sequel, producer Gaurag Doshi confirms that the original film will soon be releasing in 20,000 screens across China and Saudi Arabia.

In a recent interview, producer Gaurang Doshi said that Aankhen will always be very special to him for many reasons. He also went on to say that the film has given him an identity of being a director and has also given him Amitabh Bachchan. The director also went on saying that, having its release in China and Saudi Arabia after so many years is reassurance and encouragement to continue making films that have global stories.

Being one of the very few films that have made it to both these markets, Aankhenâ€™s release in Chinese and Arabic languages is a major breakthrough for Indian filmmakers. Interestingly, Gaurang Doshi will also be distributing his other films including Happy Anniversary, Aankhen Returns and Indians in Danger in China later this year. Gaurang Doshi has associated with Weijie Zhu, one of the largest and most coveted distributors in China, to provide Hindi movies to the Chinese audience and with Jane Saho in Saudi Arabia to cater to the Arabic viewers.
