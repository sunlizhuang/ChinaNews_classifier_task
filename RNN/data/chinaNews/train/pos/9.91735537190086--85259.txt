The Chinese Undergraduate Student Association held a Show Me Your Dance event at the Wisconsin Union Theater’s Shannon Hall on Feb. 22. Student performers and audiences from different cultural backgrounds all joined in, creating intercultural communication through art. The event featured dancers from Madacom, a Madison dance community comprised of three separate UW organizations: Dancas Dance Crew, Korean & American Student Performers (KASPer), and Hypnotiq: Hip Hop Dance Crew; as well as Project Fresh from the University of Notre Dame, and the UKAN Asian Hiphop Dance Crew from Ohio State University.
