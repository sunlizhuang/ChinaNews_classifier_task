It was a hug father and husband Greg Kim says he's been "waiting forever" for today.

After walking into the military facility in WhangaparƒÅoa at the end of a 14-day quarantine, the first thing he did was cuddle his 2-year-old daughter Elysse and hugged his wife Lily Gao, 34.

Kim has not seen them for 45 days since he left them in coronavirus-hit Wuhan, and both mother and daughter had been in quarantine since arriving back in New Zealand on February 5.

Gao was among a group of 157 people who were evacuated from Wuhan on a special flight and being kept in quarantine for two weeks.

The Kiwis and foreigners were today released from the navy base - but two were held back after one showed "mild symptoms" of coronavirus.

Director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said one of the pair was displaying mild symptoms. Both of them would have to remain in quarantine as they had been sharing a campervan at the facility.

Bloomfield issued another statement at 5.47pm confirming tests had come back negative on both people and they would be leaving the facility this evening.

All the others were cleared for release today, and New Zealand remained free from any confirmed cases of coronavirus.

"For the last two weeks, my wife and daughter has been so near and yet so far. I feel like I have had to wait forever to hug them," Kim said.

"I really missed them so much."

Gao told the Herald she was looking forward to going home and cooking a family meal, but her husband said he'd like to take to her out for a special dinner.

She worried for her family at home in Wuhan.

Health Minister David Clark said on TVNZ 1's Breakfast today the group are "generally in good heart".

"As you might expect, they have been well looked after and I want to say thank you to the health officials, Defence Force and everybody else who has been involved in the effort to make their stay as comfortable as it could be in this situation," Clark said.

Gao, who has been away from New Zealand since December 27 last year, says she misses her freedom.

Living in quarantine has not been easy for Gao, who is nearly four months pregnant.

"I miss my family and friends, and of course the freedom and space to be out and about," she said.

"But I am thankful that we are in good health, and for the support and concern that we received from everyone."

During the time in quarantine, technology was what she used to fight boredom and kept in touch with family, friends and the outside world mainly through social media and apps such as WeChat.

Gao also keeps busy during the day by reading to Elysse and taking her to the play area and walking around the safety fence.

The family had gone to Wuhan for the holidays, but Kim returned to Auckland in Jan 6 while Gao and Elysse stayed behind to celebrate Chinese New Year with her side of the family.

But the coronavirus outbreak escalated and they got trapped in the city.

Gao was one of the lucky ones, who despite having family in China, was allowed to board flight NZ1942 to return to Auckland.

Since arriving back, they have been living in a campervan at the military base where people were asked to keep to themselves as much as possible even though no one had been found to be infected.

They were told not to talk to others for more than 15 minutes and to do so only at arms length and with a mask on.

Nearly 1900 people have died from the virus in mainland China and the total confirmed cases worldwide now exceeds 72,000.
