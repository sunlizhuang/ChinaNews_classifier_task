Hey everyone,Mountblade Warband will become a open-world dragonball z game.

Do you want to act as a super hero to fight in the air or sea even in universe.Do you want to transform into a super saiyan to fight various bosses in the dragonball z world.Do you want to collect seven dragonballs to wish your hopes?

Does this sound burning and surprising?!

Please support me mentally to conduct a dragonball z mod for Mount&blade warband.This mod will differ from evey former mod in the mod history .i will present a new game rather than to say a new form mod for you.There will be no faction.This will be a crazy fight among super dragonball heros.Letâ€™s be burning and fight to experient dbz air fight and story.

Details of the mod and its translation into English will be later to show becase i am chinese so that cannot explain details in english well.

in addition, the another goal to make dbz mod is that i am a fan of halflife's very old dbz mod -esf(full named as earth special forces, started 1998). esf has a new version( seem like Bannerlord version to Mountblade Warband )and has conducted near 14 years and still doesn't release.Does its development history sound like Mountblade?

so i want to use Mountblade Warband to make and reborn esf a new version. To make a new version esf with a open-world map and story.
