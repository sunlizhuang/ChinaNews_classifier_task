All three lived between the 6th and 5th century B.C., during a period of unprecedented intellectual development: 100 years that changed the way we see ourselves forever. These trailblazers embodied the shift from a primarily supernatural worldview, to one where rational thought offered new, exciting possibilities. (3 EPS, 2015) Share |
