China's top disciplinary body on Wednesday adopted a communique, vowing to achieve high-standard intraparty and state supervision to boost the country's system and the system for governance.

The communique was adopted at the fourth plenary session of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) of the Communist Party of China (CPC), which was held in Beijing from Monday to Wednesday.

Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, Chinese president and chairman of the Central Military Commission, attended and addressed the session. Other Party and state leaders, including Li Keqiang, Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Wang Huning, Zhao Leji and Han Zheng, also attended the meeting.

The session reviewed the CCDI's progress in 2019, laid out its tasks for 2020 and passed a work report delivered by Zhao on behalf of the Standing Committee of the CCDI, according to the communique.

A speech made by Xi at the session was studied, and it was agreed that it provides important guidance to continue deepening the Party's self-reform and full and strict governance over the Party. The "strict" nature of governance must be maintained for a long period of time, according to the communique.

Summing up the achievements of 2019, the session pointed out that 2020 is very important as it is the final year to complete building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and the 13th Five-Year Plan.

For 2020, the Party and state supervision systems must be upheld and improved, checks and oversight over the exercise of power must be strengthened and a system under which officials "don't dare to, are unable to and have no desire to commit acts of corruption" must be advanced as a whole, according to the communique.

These efforts will provide a strong guarantee for securing a victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and the battle against poverty, the communique added.

An eight-point requirement was put forward by the session:

-- Strengthen the efforts to uphold Xi's position as the core of the CPC Central Committee and the whole Party, as well as the authority of the CPC Central Committee and its centralized, unified leadership;

-- Spare no effort to ensure winning the fight against poverty;

-- Deepen the reform of discipline inspection and supervision systems;

-- Strengthen oversight over the exercise of power;

-- Consolidate efforts to build excellent conduct;

-- Integrate inspection with other forms of supervision;

-- Advance the system under which officials "don't dare to, are unable to and have no desire to commit acts of corruption" as a whole;

-- Build a high-caliber team of disciplinary inspectors, who are loyal, upright and have a high sense of responsibility.

The attendees agreed that the "strict" nature of governance must be upheld.

"We shouldn't underestimate the severity and complexity of our work. The fight against corruption gets tougher as it goes deeper," said Fan Dazhi, head of the CCDI team dispatched to the China Securities Regulatory Commission.

Wang Yanfei, top discipline inspection official in Sichuan Province, highlighted the efforts to address corruption in poverty alleviation and the practice of formalities for formalities' sake and bureaucratism.

"We must use 'iron discipline' to provide a strong guarantee to the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects," Wang said.
