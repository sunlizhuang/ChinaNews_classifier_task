Among other things, the G77 and China should focus on safeguarding the common interests of developing countries, while promoting South-South cooperation and pushing for more emphasis by the UN on development issues, said Zhang Jun.

UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Zhang Jun on Wednesday proposed tasks for the Group of 77 (G77) and China, as Guyana takes over the chairmanship of the bloc from Palestine for 2020.

This year marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations (UN) and the beginning of the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development, said Zhang at a handover ceremony.

Among other things, the G77 and China should focus on safeguarding the common interests of developing countries, while promoting South-South cooperation and pushing for more emphasis by the UN on development issues, said Zhang.

As the largest developing country and a sincere supporter of the G77, China has always attached great importance to cooperation with the bloc.

In 2020, China will have completed its goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all aspects, as well as lifting its rural poor out of poverty. Looking to the future, China would be happy to share its development experience with other members of the G77 so they can achieve common development, said Zhang.

The G77 is a coalition of developing countries whose aim is to promote collective political and economic interests. While China is not a member, it is an active participant, with all official G77 statements issued in the name "The Group of 77 and China." ■
