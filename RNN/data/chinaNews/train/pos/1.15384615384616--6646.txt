China trade deal commitments not changed in translation: Mnuchin

China’s commitments in the Phase 1 trade deal with the United States were not changed during a lengthy translation process and will be released this week as the document is signed in Washington, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday, Reuters reports.

Mnuchin told Fox News Channel that the deal reached on Dec. 13 still calls for China to buy US$40-50 billion worth of American agricultural products annually and a total of US$200 billion of US goods over two years, the report said.

“It wasn’t changed in translation. I don’t know where that rumor started,” Mnuchin said on a Sunday morning show.

“We have been going through a translation process that I think we said was really a technical issue,” Mnuchin said. “And the language will be released this week. So I think it is — the day of the signing, we will be releasing the English version.”

“And people can see. This is a very, very extensive agreement,” he added.

White House officials had said as late as Friday that the final Chinese text was not yet completed, even as invitations went out to more than 200 people for a Jan. 15 signing event at the White House.

Asked if he still expects China to purchase up to US$50 billion in US farm products under the deal, Mnuchin said: “I do. Let me just say, it is 200 billion dollars of additional products across the board over the next two years, and, specifically in agriculture, 40 billion to 50 billion.”
