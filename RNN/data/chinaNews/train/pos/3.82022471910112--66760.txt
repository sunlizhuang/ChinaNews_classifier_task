Through music, poetry, dance, art and a fashion show the audience appreciated the superb performances from the many youngsters involved.

The project was funded under the European Union’s Peace IV Programme ‘Youth Let’s Talk Cultural Diversity.’

Lilian Seenoi-Barr, Director of Programmes, North West Migrants Forum said Friday night was the celebration of hard work, dedication and tenacity from all the young people involved in rolling out the project across all spheres of life and believed, in future, this should include all the schools in the region, both primary and secondary.

“Our programme extended to all section of the community and I believe that an inclusive society can only be achieved if communities work together to resolve the issues that impact on them.

“Our intention was to encourage young people from right across the district council area to engage with the big issues that impact on them and their communities and based on what we saw tonight it was a success.

“I believed it was vitally important to engage with young people and listen to their view points, ideas and perspectives on expression of culture, religion, politics, identity and how-to bring communities together. Again, tonight proved this.”

There was almost a dozen post primary schools and colleges across the District Council Area signed up to take part in this year’s programme with some even awaiting a visit until the new school year in September.

“Diversity is our unavoidable human condition. And the North West Migrants Forum plays a pivotal role in promoting social inclusion and respect among all, regardless of social, religious or ethnic background.”

She said she was bursting with pride and a lot of optimism that the country and the city in particular, is in ‘good hands.’

‘These young people talked tonight about their personal journeys and experience through the project and it was lovely to hear the many positive aspects of where they’ve come to.

“This project had made us all recognise the human family is made up of a rich array of peoples, cultures, languages, religions, races, ethnicities, beliefs, customs, social standing and wealth.’

The Director of Programmes at NWMF also praised her staff, volunteers and the many others who helped out in the programme, concluding:
