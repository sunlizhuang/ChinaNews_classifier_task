"As a life insurer, we want to help people reach their financial goals and serve their insurance needs, as we are part of China Life Group - the largest insurer in China and a Fortune Global 500 company."

China Life Insurance Singapore is running a promotion campaign till March 31 which rewards customers with up to $8,888 (SGD or USD) when they purchase any of its selected insurance plans - China Life Harvest Income Plan (USD), China Life Lifetime Income Plan or China Life Retire Easy Plan.

On the inspiration behind the red packet's vibrant and unique design, Ms Eve Lim, an art director at Singapore Press Holdings' creative and content marketing unit Sweet, said: "I was born in the Year of the Rat and I am a cheese lover.

"My design subtly incorporates the tiny rat superimposed on a broad cheese design layout. It is cute to look at, with an element of fun, yet also refreshing and meaningful."
