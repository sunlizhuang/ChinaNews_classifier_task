At the Fulingbei railway station, messages from the radio spread a feeling of warmth and encouragement to the travelers. The voice that spreads them comes from Liu Peihan, a 26-year-old staff member at the station.

After graduating from Chongqing Normal University studying broadcasting and hosting, Liu secured a job on the railways. It is her friendly voice on the radio that reminds travelers to check their tickets, watch their step and wishes them a safe trip.

Because of her strong abilities and sense of responsibility, Liu has been selected as an attendant at the station and entrusted with greater duties.

Besides helping the passengers get on and off trains, she also has to assign tasks to the team members, oversee security inspections, patrol the waiting room and handle all kinds of emergencies. She sometimes walks more than 20,000 steps on a shift.

As the Spring Festival travel rush, and also the first one Liu is facing in her new position, is approaching, more trains are now arriving and departing from the station, which poses great challenges for Liu and her team. Up to six trains will be running at the station between 7:20 a.m. and 8:20 am, Liu said.

Liu works hard to get the team members, who come from different places and have very different personalities, to be more united and provide better services for the passengers.

Since 12 out of the total 14 team members are aged below 35, Liu helps them solve problems in both work and life and share her experience with them.

During breaks at work, she often shows elderly people where to go at the station, lends a helping hand to women with kids and luggage and helps travelers solve problems with a smile on her face. She considers patience and consideration important qualities in her job.
