Mauritius President Prithvirajsing Roopun attended a party to welcome the new director of the China Cultural Center in Mauritius on Jan 31.

“Thanks to support from the Chinese and Mauritius governments and China Embassy to Mauritius, mutual understanding between the two nations was deepened through a series of cultural exchange events, including Chinese Film Week, Happy Chinese New Year, Dragon Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations,” Roopun said.

He said many impressive cultural activities were held by the center over the past four years. Cultural exchange will be brought to a higher level with effort from the two governments, he added.

As Zhang Xinhong took office as the new director of the China Cultural Center in Mauritius, an event was held to welcome his arrival and bid farewell to his predecessor Song Yanqun. Chinese Ambassador to Mauritius Li Miaoguang and about 300 guests, students from the center and local representatives from the Mauritius Chinese Association attended the party.
