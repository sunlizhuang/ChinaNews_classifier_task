Vice President-elect William Lai says that Taiwan will cooperate with the US and the international community to achieve common goals. Lai was speaking Tuesday during a meeting on religious freedom held in Washington, DC.

Lai said Taiwan is a democratic country that respects religious freedom. He said Taiwan will work to protect religious freedom and build a world free from fear of religious persecution.

Sam Brownback, the US Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom, said Lai’s visit is historic, as he is the highest-level Taiwanese official to visit the US in years. Lai’s US trip is the first by a Taiwanese vice-president elect since the US switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. [FULL STORY]
