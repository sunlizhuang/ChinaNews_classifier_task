RESIDENTS are being urged to apply for a role with the Neighbourhood Watch Scheme.

The former Neighbourhood Watch Scheme Coordinator for Wickham Bishops, Sian Bewick, is looking to hand over this voluntary role.

Wickham Bishops Parish Council posted a call-out on their online page.

A council spokesman said: “Our grateful thanks go to Ms Bewick, who has reinvigorated and modernised our NHW Scheme over the last few years, creating strong links within the community.

“Our Street Coordinators will remain in post and Sian will be on hand to help with the transition.”

Duties include noting and sharing suspicious behaviour, speaking with Essex Police, and putting together a monthly report for the parish council.
