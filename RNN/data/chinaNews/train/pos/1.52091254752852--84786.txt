Huawei Mate Xs is the most ambitious foldable phone yet - here’s why

Although Huawei isn't giving much away just yet, there's already been plenty of rumours and leaks which paint a pretty clear picture of what is to come.

Perhaps the biggest change will be the arrival of 5G to this popular range of devices which will allow owners to access superfast downloads when away from Wi-Fi. Huawei is no stranger to releasing 5G-ready phones but this will be the first time it's come to such a mainstream device.

Another bonus of this smartphone could be a souped-up camera system.

Rumours have suggested the P40 Pro will boast a very impressive 10x optical zoom which, if true, would be double that of the P30 Pro that comes with a 5x optical zoom.

It’s also expected the Huawei flagship will come with a new primary, ultra wide-angle and a time-of-flight shooter.
