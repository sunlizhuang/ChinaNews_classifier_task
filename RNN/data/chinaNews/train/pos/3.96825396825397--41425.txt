Later this year, VegaFina and Great Wall Cigar will collaborate on a new cigar called VegaFina Fusion Edition.

A representative for Tabacalera S.L.U.—the Imperial Brands division that manages VegaFina—confirmed the release, but declined to provide more details, including where the cigar would be made.

“The product is intended to ‘fuse’ all the equity and the premium character of both brands in one single product intended to be appealing for both the Chinese and the international consumer.”

VegaFina’s cigars are produced at Imperial’s Tabacalera de García factory in La Romana, the Dominican Republic. Great Wall is described as the largest cigar maker in China with operations in Shifang.
