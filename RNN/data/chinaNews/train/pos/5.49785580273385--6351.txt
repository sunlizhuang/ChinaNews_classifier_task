VIENTIANE, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- The 2020 "Happy Chinese New Year" festival was celebrated in the Lao capital of Vientiane on Saturday and Sunday.

The festival, co-organized by the China Cultural Center in Laos and the Chengdu municipal bureau of culture, radio, television and tourism, was held at the Lao National Cultural Hall in Vientiane. A total of 7,000 people attended the two-day event.

On Saturday, the Lao Minister of Information, Culture and Tourism Kikeo Khaikhamphithoune, Chinese Ambassador to Laos Jiang Zaidong, together with diplomatic envoys in Laos and people of all walks of life attended the festival's opening ceremony.

The opening ceremony was kicked off with a live performance of gongs and drums and a lion dance. The actors from the Chengdu School of Culture and Arts brought drama and dance performances, folk songs, acrobatics, martial arts, magic shows and other cultural performances with Chinese characteristics to the audience.

The festival also featured activities such as Chinese food and culture exhibitions, Chinese traditional games and quizzes, among others.

In addition, Chinese chefs gave culinary performances, and the food they prepared were quickly sold out. Art demonstrations, such as sugar painting, eggshell painting, dough modelling and shadow puppetry offered local people the chance to experience traditional Chinese culture and the skills of inheritors of the intangible culture.

The "Happy Chinese New Year" festival, which has been held in Vientiane for six consecutive years since 2015, has become an important event for Lao people and overseas Chinese to experience Chinese culture. Enditem
