The venerated, actor, best known for his roles in Star Trek and the X-Men films, placed his hands and feet in cement outside the historic TCL Chinese Theatre, in a tradition dating back to 1927.

“I’m still not really believing any of it,” Sir Patrick, 79, said at the ceremony.

“Any moment now somebody will say, ‘Patrick, Patrick, get up, you’re dreaming again.’”

Sir Patrick – wearing a pair of trainers to imprint his footprints – joined an exclusive group of Hollywood stars with a personalised spot outside the theatre. Previous honourees include Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Orson Welles, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Morgan Freeman and recent inductee US comedian Kevin Hart.

An emotional Sir Patrick described his hand and footprint ceremony as an “extraordinary, exciting honour”.

“I hesitate to say I’m proud because I feel that would somehow indicate I feel I deserve this and I’m really not sure I do,” he added.

The actor, who was joined at the event by his songwriter wife Sunny Ozell, was born in Mirfield, West Yorkshire. It was there that he got his first taste of acting after being cast in a play while studying at Mirfield Secondary Modern School.

He is currently preparing for the release of Star Trek: Picard, which will see him reprise his role as captain Jean-Luc Picard.

The 10-part series has already been renewed for a second season by CBS and will stream on Amazon Prime Video in the UK.
