MUNICH, Germany, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada will stand firmly with the Chinese people in the combat against the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic, Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said here on Friday.

Champagne made the remarks while meeting with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sideline of the 56th Munich Security Conference.

Champagne said that Canada appreciates the outstanding leadership exercised by President Xi Jinping and the Chinese government in the fight against the epidemic.

In the fight, China has made important contributions to preventing the spread of the epidemic and has been widely appreciated by all parties, he said.

Unlike some other countries, Canada has never stopped normal exchanges with China and opposes any discriminatory practice, he said.

Canada will continue to do so, and the Canadian government and people will stand firmly with Chinese people in the battle and provide all necessary assistance to China, he said.

Champagne also expressed his willingness to visit China at an early date to show support for China.

For his part, Wang said that Chinese people are united in their efforts to fight the epidemic.

Thanks to China's efforts, the epidemic has been effectively controlled and the cure rate is on the rise, Wang said.

China will never slack off and will continue to spare no effort to treat the patients, while continuing to cooperate with the international community to achieve an early and eventual victory in the anti-epidemic battle, he noted.

Since the epidemic broke out, Canada has always adopted a rational, calm and scientific attitude and provided China with valuable support and assistance, which are appreciated by the Chinese side, Wang said.

"China and Canada have a tradition of helping each other in times of hardship. We would like to carry forward this tradition," Wang said.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Canada.

China is willing to take this opportunity to enhance communication with the Canadian side and jointly solve existing bilateral problems so as to bring China-Canada relations and cooperation in various fields back onto the track for sound and stable development at an early date, Wang added. Enditem
