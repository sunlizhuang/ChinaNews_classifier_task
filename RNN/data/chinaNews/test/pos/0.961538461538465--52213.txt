Blog-February 4, 2020—10-11—It’s YOUR Agri Business

In our 9:00 show---Governor Kristi Noem joined us ---we talked legislature, small town incentives, opportunities---and even the Iowa Caucus---and State of the Union event later today.

One of the things she continues to include is South Dakota Soybean President-CEO---Jerry Schmitz---talking about the values the old time values in South Dakota.

We’ll talk with Jerry –about that—the China Deal—the USMCA—and the pioneer spirit that lives on. The Governor wants red carpet –not red tape for those in rural areas.

We’ll start the show there.

Mitch Richtor—lobbying—in Pierre South Dakota Farmers Union.

Hemp is on the agenda---we’ll look at what he sees---and some of those conversations with others representing Ag that happens a couple of times a month—to find ways to work together to help all those who can certainly use our help.

An old friend of ours—David Kolsrud will join us----he has been working with Locus Agricultural Solutions and Nori who have announced a partnership that provides a pathway for carbon payments to farmers.

Providing farmers incentives to grow crops in a way that would remove atmospheric carbon by using advanced nature based technology can help turn one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions into one of the largest sinks. It could help combat climate change and increase food security as well.

David has been working on this for months—and says there is even more to the opportunity—that included in the release information above.

Around the half hour—Rick Shields—Senior Midwest Communication Farm Voice—and Sarah Heinrich—KFGO Fargo—will update us on the morning farm news we may have missed.

Matt Swenson—Partner Swenson Commodities—will give us the morning trends with beef, pork, corn, soybeans, energy, coins and stocks. What is moving the market---Matt will have some ideas.

We’ll also share a portion of our interview with Governor Noem done in the 9:00 hour before we get to 10:44.
