Ackmann’s “These Fevered Days” peoples the poet’s world more thoroughly than do previous accounts. The author’s gaze widens from the claustrophobic family constellation — Dickinson’s parents, Edward and Emily; her siblings, Vinnie and Austin; Austin’s wife, Sue, and mistress, Mabel — that dominates most biographies. We meet the Amherst professor Ebenezer Snell, who meticulously records the weather each day, and his daughter Sabra, who takes over the task at his death; the Rev. Aaron Colton, whose sermons Dickinson admires as a teenager; the community choristers she joins at Mr. Woodman’s Sunday evening singing school.

When Ackmann chronicles the day in February 1848 on which the 17-year-old Dickinson, away at school, turns aside her headmistress’s invitation to pledge her life to Christ, instead remaining a “no hoper” in the school’s lexicon, we learn a good deal about Mount Holyoke Female Seminary’s indomitable headmistress, Mary Lyon; the nosy wife of a trustee; and, most helpfully, the seminary’s students and recent graduates. Ackmann lets us know that two-thirds of Dickinson’s classmates were either “professors of religion” or hopefuls, and she details the future plans their professions of faith permitted them to entertain. By placing Dickinson, an outstanding scholar, amid a cluster of other young academic stars — Sarah Worcester, Louisa Plimpton, Celia Wright and Fidelia Fiske — all of whom nurtured dreams of missionary work in China, Persia or on Native lands in the United States, Ackmann underscores Dickinson’s singularity, and allows the reader to feel the companionship the young poet enjoyed, from which she would gradually retreat.

Ackmann’s 10 episodes include the first publication of a poem by Dickinson; a consequential meeting with her friend and eventual editor Thomas Wentworth Higginson; and the day of the poet’s death. But not all are so eventful — unless you consider intellection to be active, as Ackmann and many Dickinson scholars reasonably do. Ackmann reads Dickinson’s letters closely for signs of the motion of thought; her aim is to “crack open” the poet’s “interior world, recreating a landscape of Dickinson’s consciousness.” Here is where the confounding aspect of her book begins. With the same confidence as when she’s closely paraphrasing Dickinson’s letters, Ackmann dares to tell us what Dickinson thinks, or even, occasionally, does, when these thoughts or actions can’t be known. Ackmann’s summary of a letter in which Dickinson recalls her first, indelible impression of a friend who’d arrived at school with dandelions twined in her hair, concludes with Ackmann’s supposition, phrased as a certainty: “One image could change everything, she thought.”

Perhaps emboldened by her familiarity with Dickinson’s surroundings, Ackmann recreates for us the day on which Dickinson first assembles one of her now famous fascicles, the hand-sewn pamphlets in which she gathered many of her poems, when that day can only be imagined.
