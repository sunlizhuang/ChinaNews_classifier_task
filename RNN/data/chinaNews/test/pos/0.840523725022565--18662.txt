Definition:

Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) is a robot which performs the behaviors or tasks with a high degree of autonomy. These robots rely mainly on autonomous navigation where it does not require any wires, tape, GPS or other navigation. AMR has its laser guidance system which assures precise navigation, helps in obstacle avoidance and human safety. Amr works by gathering information from the sensors and plotting an exact map representation and then executing optimal collision-free path for a given task to be handled. The demand for AMR is significantly higher compared to conventional industrial robots because of its better feature such as, that it can operate autonomously in unknown and dynamic environments to fulfill their assigned tasks.
