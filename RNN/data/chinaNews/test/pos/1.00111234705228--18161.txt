On his recent trip to Texas this past weekend, President Donald Trump had something to crow about.

It was Trump’s 14th visit to the state since being elected president, which some Democrats view as a measure of his vulnerability in a potential battleground state this fall.

And certainly, Trump was more embattled than usual when he arrived in Texas to address the American Farm Bureau Federation’s convention on Sunday. It was the eve of his impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate, following his impeachment in December, on a mostly party-line vote, by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.

It’s highly unlikely that the trial, which began on Tuesday, will result in Trump’s removal from office. And perhaps with that in mind, the proceedings looming in Washington didn’t seem to put too much of a damper on the president’s outlook as he addressed the farmers and ranchers gathered in Austin.

Trump touted what he described as “stunning,” “groundbreaking,” and “tremendous” trade-related victories.

Those successes have gotten relatively little attention, given their potentially sweeping impact. This is particularly true for states such as Texas, which leads the nation in exports, and cities such as Houston, with a globalized economy that has been exposed to some risk as a result of Trump’s generally protectionist instincts, among other things.

“Houstonians shouldn’t assume that trade, foreign investment and immigration will grow at the same pace over the next 10 years,” the Greater Houston Partnership warned in a June 2019 report. “All three face headwinds.”

It’s good news, then, that the Senate on Thursday passed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, by an 89-10 vote. The agreement is a modernization of the landmark North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which went into effect in 1994. Trump, who blasted NAFTA during the 2016 campaign, is expected to sign the new trade agreement this week.

And last week, Trump signed an initial trade deal with China, the world’s second-largest economy in terms of nominal gross domestic product.

In Austin, the president struck a victorious note in describing these accomplishments.

“The two momentous trade deals we completed last week are just the beginning of a really incredible story. Because nobody thought we’d ever get here,” the president said. “They’d say the deal with China would be impossible to make, and getting rid of NAFTA would be totally impossible.”

Getting there had not been easy, Trump allowed, particularly for America’s farmers and ranchers. Many have been hit by retaliatory tariffs during the course of his first term, a result of his own hardball negotiating tactics.

In fact, many farmers and ranchers are still struggling as a result of those tariffs, because neither of the deals has taken effect yet. The president acknowledged as much, marveling at the fortitude those Americans have shown in continuing to support him despite what he described as the media’s efforts to stir up mischief by asking questions.

He cited a new poll from Farm Journal, a trade publication, that found 83 percent of the country’s farmers and ranchers approve of his performance as president.

“But, I want to know, really: Who are the 17 percent? Who are they?” Trump said, to laughter from the audience.

Trump also reminisced about the first time he met Texas Agriculture Sid Miller, who has billed himself as “Trump’s man in Texas” and was among the state leaders in attendance at the convention.

“I didn’t know Sid,” Trump said, when they first met during the 2016 campaign. “But he was big, and he had the big, beautiful cowboy hat on. I love that hat.”

Trump was right to compliment our cowboy hats, of course—and to celebrate his success in negotiating the trade deals in question.

It might be tough for Trump critics to agree with that, particularly in an election year. Neither deal is perfect and his negotiating style has been nerve-wracking, if nothing else.

The agreement with China, in particular, is at most a first step. It leaves Trump’s tariffs on most Chinese imports in place for the foreseeable future. It also sets targets for China to buy specific amounts of American exports in the coming years, meaning that it’s a trade deal with a certain built-in skepticism of free trade.

The USMCA, meanwhile, might be described as NAFTA 2.0. It addresses some of Trump’s stated concerns with the latter agreement — for example, Canada has agreed to reduce its tariffs on American dairy imports — but preserves the overarching framework and ethos of that landmark deal.

Still, Texans should be relieved that such deals are getting done, on a bipartisan basis, given the deep divide in Washington and the discord arising from the impeachment process.

Trump is a longtime critic of free trade, and a proponent of trade wars, to boot. He has described the latter as “good” and “easy to win,” a claim that few would agree with. He has also derided NAFTA, which has had a particularly seminal effect on the state’s economic development since the end of the 20th century, as “the worst trade deal in the history of trade deals.”

So Texans — most of whom support trade — should take a moment to exhale.

The deals that Trump touted in Austin aren’t perfect, but the alternative would be an escalation of the trade war, and none of us want that.
