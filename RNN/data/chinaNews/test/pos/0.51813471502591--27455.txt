We quiz some long-term Beijingers on how they intend to spend this year's Chinese New Year and hopefully uncover some horror stories along the way. 过年 How, y'all?

It may not be difficult to hear about the newest gourmet restaurants or the hottest clubbing events around the city but getting the scoop on art happenings, especially those that stray from the mainstream, can be quite the challenge. However, French photographer Pierre Alivon has built a career here doing exactly that, turning his camera on the city and its people to discover niche lifestyles and esoteric happenings. Alivon then uses what he finds to fuel the curation of Art-Des, Destination club's adjoining art gallery.

Alivon then has been integral to building Art-Des' reputation as one of the few Beijing galleries dedicated to showing works from LGBTQ artists or housing pieces that address issues related to sexuality, identity, and perceived taboos in China's largely conservative climate. Ahead of Chinese New Year, we spoke to Alivon about what he envisions for the year ahead.

What's your full name and where are you from?

Pierre Alivon (苏善书) from Paris, France.

What’s your Chinese zodiac (from the year you were born)? Do you think you’re typical of that sign? Why or why not?

I belong to the year of the monkey and I think I have a lot of characteristics that are similar to the monkey. For example, my capacity for action belongs to a very strong type of person, and I am always energetic during the creative process – this brings to mind the impression of a monkey.

What does your average CNY entail? Where are you headed this year? At a guess, how will it differ to last year?

This year I'm going to spend the new year with a Chinese family in the city of Huaining; to experience the new year from inside the house of a Chinese family is to become an actor in this event, rather than a spectator like in previous years. This will allow me to better understand the ties of the Chinese family.

Tell us about a particular CNY nightmare that you've encountered.

Previously, I dreamed that on New Year's Eve, the long streets were empty but there were thousands of lights, I was cold and hungry but I could not buy food with the money I had in hand. Just when I was feeling hopeless, suddenly a group of mice pulled me into their row, and I became a little mouse. I joined their New Year's party, and we sang and danced by a bin.

Which dishes do you particularly look forward to gorging on every year? Drinks?

Dumplings and red wine, of course, but what I really want to experience is southern China's traditional New Year's dinner.

What are three tips for avoiding the excesses of eating and drinking that a proper CNY is defined by?

First, eat on time and sleep less. Second, eat more fruit and vegetables and eat meat appropriately. Third, drink alcohol appropriately or replace alcohol with tea.

Got any tips on how to deflect those awkward family questions?

I think when your New Year's hosts ask you questions it's just because they are anxious to get to know you and is often about love, marriage, work, etc. It is precisely because young people choose to avoid speaking that their interrogators' curiosity is increased to the point where they begin to worry. So my suggestion is to try to be more proactive and not wait for them to ask questions.

Is there anyone this year that’s particularly deserving of a big fat hongbao from yourself?

Edmund Yang, co-founder of the Destination group, for his big heart and support for my exhibition project and for Art-Des gallery.

What do you predict the Year of the Rat holds for you?

My goal for 2020 is to give a voice to more young artists and to allow them to be able to express themselves through their art.
