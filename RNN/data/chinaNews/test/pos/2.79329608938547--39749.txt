The Department of Health and Human Services are now advising all people who have visited Hubei province in China to stay at home and avoid public settings until 14 days after they left Hubei.

Anyone who has been in close contact with a confirmed case of 2019-nCoV (Coronoavirus) should also stay at home and avoid public settings until 14 days after their last contact.

In line with this advice, students and teachers who have travelled to Hubei Province in China should not attend school or university until 14 days after leaving Hubei.

Children, students, teachers and people who work in childcare who have travelled to other parts of China are not required to stay away from childcare, preschool, school or university unless you:
