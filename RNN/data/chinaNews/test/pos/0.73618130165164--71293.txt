The world is staring at an epidemic in the form of coronavirus outbreak that started in China's Wuhan city early December last year. There are no second thoughts about that. Over 60,000 people the world over have been infected with Covid-19 (earlier known as 2019-novel Coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) and the death toll has crossed 1,350. While the infection is primarily concentrated in China, confirmed cases have been reported in at least 25 countries so far.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has been at the forefront in fighting this health crisis under the leadership of its Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Since December 31, 2019, when WHO was first informed about pneumonia cases in Wuhan emanating from "unknown causes", the WHO has been actively monitoring the situation and holding consultations at different levels.

These include declaring the outbreak an international health emergency, mobilising the international scientific community to come together to fight coronavirus, and issuing safety precautions and guidelines for general public, businesses, governments, hospitals and other stakeholders, among other measures.

As WHO chief, Dr Ghebreyesus flew in to China to meet President Xi Jinping, and a WHO team comprising of international health experts is already operating in China. Dr Ghebreyesus has also been interacting with world leaders, spearheading calls for research collaborations and raising funds to tackle the coronavirus outbreak.

We have a choice. Can we come together to face a common and dangerous enemy? Or will we allow fear, suspicion and irrationality to distract and divide us?-DrTedros at #MSC2020 on #COVID19 #coronavirus February 15, 2020

But these efforts by the WHO in the face of a global health emergency, about which very little is known, seem to be of little consideration for a section of society that has unleashed a brutal attack against Dr Ghebreyesus on social media.

The attack is not only personal in nature, but also seeks to tarnish his professional image by questioning his credentials and commitment.

'CHINA'S LAP DOG'

Dr Ghebreyesus has been accused of conspiring with China in its "propaganda" to hush-up coronavirus cases. Many have gone on to call him "China's lap dog", say he is "irresponsible and coward", and accuse him of "jeopardising the world for his private profit", among other charges.

The WHO chief's recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and his tweets praising the country's leadership for its "determination to end the new coronavirus outbreak" too have not gone down well with many social media users.

Today I met with Xi Jinping, President of #China, in Beijing to discuss next steps in battle against the new #coronavirus outbreak. @WHO appreciates the seriousness with which is taking this outbreak & the transparency authorities have demonstrated. https://t.co/WGadkXEpP5 pic.twitter.com/dqVMBXKXrM Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) January 28, 2020

Irked by his alleged mishandling of the coronavirus crisis, his critics have started an online petition on Change.org, demanding that the United Nations sack him immediately. The petition, which has already been signed by more than 3,77,000 people, argues Dr Ghebreyesus should have declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health crisis much earlier.

The petition blames Dr Ghebreyesus for the rising coronavirus cases and resultant deaths, and says this is partly because of his underestimation of the outbreak.

"We strongly think he is not fit for his role as WHO Director General. We call for the immediate resignation of Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. A lot of us are really disappointed. We believe WHO is supposed to be politically neutral," the petition reads. Its comment section, where people mention why they are signing the petition, is filled with derogatory remarks that are unmentionable.

In short, Dr Ghebreyesus is being hounded online on two counts:

He met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing and praised China for its efforts in controlling the coronavirus outbreak; and The WHO did not declare coronavirus outbreak an international health crisis at an earlier date.

MISPLACED ANGER

People's concerns and anxiety about the coronavirus outbreak are understandable but that cannot be an excuse to malign the WHO or its chief. In times of an epidemic of this magnitude, people, irrespective of national boundaries and political leanings, need to stand united and support individuals and organisations that are working on ground to tackle the crisis.

Hurling personal attacks on individuals leading such efforts doesn't help improve the situation, but rather often proves to be counterproductive. It infuses negativity in public discourse, which in turn tends to cast aspersions on genuine efforts--a breeding ground for suspicion and misinformation.

A confrontational approach against President Xi Jinping is likely to snowball and prove futile when it comes to controlling the situation.

Secondly, one may have a hundred differences with China and what its political system and leadership stands for. But is this really the time to attack and malign the nation?

Before attacking Dr Ghebreyesus for meeting President Xi Jinping and praising his government's efforts against coronavirus, one must realise that besides leading an international health organisation in the midst of an epidemic, Dr Ghebreyesus also has to negotiate various diplomatic hurdles in forging an international coalition against the epidemic. With regards to coronavirus, this global effort is simply impossible if China is not on board.

Faced with such a sensitive situation, the WHO chief cannot afford to upset the Chinese leadership, even if there are some shortcomings on ground. A confrontational approach against President Xi Jinping is likely to snowball and prove futile when it comes to controlling the situation.

Those who are calling Dr Ghebreyesus names and demanding his resignation must answer if they think China would have allowed a WHO team comprising international health experts to visit coronavirus-hit regions and investigate the situation had the health body's chief confronted President Xi and talked bitter about him.

The reality today is that thousands of people are suffering in China. Many have died and many more are likely to die in the coming days. Priority for the global community right now should be to control the situation, not to embroil itself in mudslinging and waste its energy by pointing fingers in a show of one-upmanship. Investigations into who and what went wrong (if at all) can wait. Saving lives can't.

Dr Ghebreyesus's success in convincing China to allow a team of international health experts to visit coronavirus-affected regions is nothing short of a major diplomatic success. If at all China deliberately hid facts or underreported the situation, as is alleged, it will be known to the world in due course when these international experts document their observations.

Why do we have to jump into conclusions without any evidence and tarnish the image of hardworking health workers who have been slogging day in out treating patients? Those leading the vitriol online attack against the WHO and its chief must answer if slander, malice and a hatred-filled anti-China campaign is how these tireless medicos deserve to be treated with for their services.

Priority right now should be to control the situation, not to embroil ourselves in mudslinging and waste our energy by pointing fingers in a show of one-upmanship. Investigations into who and what went wrong (if at all) can wait. Saving lives can't.

The other reason why the WHO and Dr Ghebreyesus are being attacked stems from the argument that Dr Ghebreyesus didn't declare coronavirus outbreak an international health emergency at an earlier date.

Those forwarding this argument must understand that decisions to declare an international emergency cannot be based on one person's whims and fancies. Far from being a one-person show, it involves rigorous assessments and deliberations between various stakeholders, all of which takes time. Even before declaring it an international health emergency, the WHO had been rigorously following up on research and treatment of coronavirus patients in China.

However, none of this means China, the WHO or Dr Ghebreyesus are above questioning. One must question them by all means, but personal attacks and a campaign aimed at tarnishing individuals and maligning an entire country is definitely not the way to do so.
