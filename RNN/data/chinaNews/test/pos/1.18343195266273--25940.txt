Crown Resorts' controversial investor, Lawrence Ho's Melco Resorts and Entertainment, is expected to respond on Monday to reports that its offices in Tokyo were raided as part of a political corruption probe relating to casino developments in the country.

Melco's offices in Tokyo were raided between January 17 and 20, according to reports from Japan's major media groups, including financial newspaper Nikkei.

The raids came just days after Tokyo prosecutors arrested Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker Tsukasa Akimoto on suspicion of accepting bribes from Chinese gambling group, 500.com.

Mr Akimoto, who is in detention, has denied any wrongdoing.
