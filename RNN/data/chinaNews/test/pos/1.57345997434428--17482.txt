Yang, also director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, said the purpose of the UN Security Council's reform is to enhance its authority and effectiveness, enable developing countries and medium- and small-sized countries to have a greater representation and say, and reflect the international trends of democracy and multi-polarization.

Yang said China will actively support the co-chairs to make sure that the reform will be carried out in line with the UN Charter and member countries' shared interests.

Nusseibeh and Wronecka, who are permanent representatives of the United Arab Emirates and Poland, respectively, to the UN, said they attach great importance to China's position on and role in the UN Security Council reform and are willing to maintain the momentum of communication and consultation between different sides.

State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi also met with Nusseibeh and Wronecka on Tuesday.

Wang said that the UN Security Council's reform should uphold extensive and democratic consultations and reflect the Member State-driven character.
