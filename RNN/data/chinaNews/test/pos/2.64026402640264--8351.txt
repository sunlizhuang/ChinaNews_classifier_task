TFWA has further strengthened its network in Asia with the opening of a new office in Shanghai, to be headed by Hannah Gao as TFWA’s Chief Representative in China.

As well as the TFWA Asia Pacific Conference & Exhibition, which typically takes place in May in Singapore each year, the Tax Free World Association also hosts a biennial China’s Century Conference, for which TRBusiness has been the official media publication (2015, 2017 and 2019).

The new facility will enable TFWA to further develop its relations with key stakeholders and to promote its events within greater China.

CHINA: A VITAL MARKET

TFWA President Alain Maingreaud commented: “It goes without saying that China is a vital market for us at TFWA, as it is for other organisations in the duty free and travel retail business.

“Hannah has excellent contacts among brands, retailers and airports, and she is well placed to help us to foster even closer relationships with our partners and clients in this all-important region.

“This new office will build on the excellent work done until now by Pierre Lequeux and his team at GLI.

“Pierre and GLI will continue to represent TFWA in Korea and South East Asia and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership.”

Gao has over ten years of experience in the travel retail industry, and has assisted a number of companies looking to expand in the Chinese duty free market.

She is fluent in both English and Chinese, and holds a Master’s degree in integrated marketing communications from Beijing University.

The last China’s Century Conference took place in Sanya, Hainan earlier this year. Extensive coverage of the event can be found at the following links: https://bit.ly/30m9hXP https://bit.ly/36VaKXU https://bit.ly/2uIsask https://bit.ly/2TpiaOT https://bit.ly/30ow71k https://bit.ly/35RBiI7
