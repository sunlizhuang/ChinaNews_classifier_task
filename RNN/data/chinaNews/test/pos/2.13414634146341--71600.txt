Cambodia has in recent times established itself as one of China’s closest allies and has often been at odds with Washington.

Cruise ship turned away by five other countries

Five countries turned away the Westerdam despite it having no known cases of passengers carrying the coronavirus, Covid-19.

Cambodia’s authoritarian prime minister, Hun Sen, stepped in and agreed the passengers could disembark there.

The Westerdam then docked in the port of Sihanoukville on Thursday.

It had by that time been shunned for two weeks.

PM Hun Sen then personally flew in on a helicopter to receive the passengers.

Its 1,455 passengers began to disembark on Friday to head home.

The cruise ship is operated by Carnival Corp. unit Holland America Inc.

The passengers were tested regularly on the ship.

Cambodia tested 20 of the passengers once it docked.

None were found to have the new coronavirus.

Cambodia, friend of China

PM Hun Sen has sparred with the United States, most recently since 2017 after the Southeast Asian country was condemned for its crackdown on the opposition.

Cambodia has also been accused of human rights abuses.

PM Hun Sen has brought Cambodia much closer to China, which has provided billions of dollars in aid and in loans for infrastructure projects.

China has stood by Cambodia in the face of Western criticism.
