Newly installed Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian has conveyed Beijing’s gratitude and appreciation to all its Filipino friends and the Chinese community in Manila for their valuable contributions in the “sustained, sound and stable growth” of the Philippines-China relations.

“The year 2019 witnessed the sustained betterment and growth of China-Philippines relations. President Xi Jinping and President Duterte met twice last year, setting the strategic course for the steady growth of China-Philippines relationship,” Huang said in his remarks at the celebration of the Chinese New Year, Wednesday night.

The Chinese New Year reception also coincided with the welcome party for Huang who officially assumed his ambassadorial post to Manila in early December 2019.

“During the past one and half months since I arrived in the Philippines as new Chinese ambassador, I have extensively engaged with Philippine friends from all walks of life and clearly felt the warmth of your friendship. Taking this opportunity, I would like to thank all of you for awarding me the grand entry,” he said.

In his remarks, Huang boasts of the progress made so far in the Philippines-China relations which started to bloom when President Duterte assumed power in 2016 and opted to embrace closer ties with Beijing, under his avowed independent foreign policy.

As a result, Huang said China has now become the Philippines’ top trading partner, the second-largest source of tourists and one of its largest investors.

Last year alone, he noted that more than 1.5 million Chinese nationals visited the Philippines.

On infrastructure, Huang said both countries have been actively synergizing China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative and the Duterte administration’s Build, Build, Build project.

“I am sure as more and more Chinese projects are launched and completed, they will bring more tangible benefits to the Philippine people,” he said.

With regard to the South China Sea issue, the Chinese envoy also heralded the important developments in the Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea (BCM) and the consultation on the Code of Conduct (COC) under the aegis of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

He pointed out that with the Philippines as the country coordinator of the China-ASEAN dialogue, the talks on the COC has been “steadily moving forward, contributing to the peace and stability of the region and beyond.”

Another example is the ongoing port call of a Chinese Coast Guard in Manila, a historic first in the bilateral relations between the two countries which, according to Huang conveys the message of “friendship, cooperation and goodwill.”

With the year 2020 marking the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Philippines, Huang called on the Philippines to “seize the day and live it to the full to work for the greater development of both countries as well as the sustained growth of our bilateral ties.”
