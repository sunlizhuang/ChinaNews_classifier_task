According to the ambassador, Italy has been considered one of the most favored European destinations for Chinese travelers since 2018. “In 2019, we saw a 20 percent increase in the visas issued. We received over 3 million travelers from China. I believe that number will be 4 million this year,” said Ferrari, who is confident that Italy is well-prepared to attract more travelers.“First of all, we create a very large and sophisticated network of offices to issue visas,” he said, adding that a new agreement has been reached between the two countries’ aviation departments to increase the number of flights between China and Italy from 56 a week to 164.“That is a dramatic change that will give enormous growing space for more Chinese to travel to Italy and for more Italians to travel to China,” he said. These flights will not only include Milan and Rome, but also smaller cities such as Florence, Venice, Bologna and even Pisa.For the special year, the Palace Museum and National Museum of China will work with the Italian side on exchange exhibitions. Parts of the Terracotta Army, an imperial icon of ancient Chinese art and civilization will travel thousands of miles to Italy for a new exhibition there.“Together we have more 16 percent of the world’s UNESCO sites. This makes us two superpowers from a cultural point of view,” Ferrari told the Global Times. “Uniting these sites will give something more to our citizens, to people in China and people in Italy. I think that is very special.”In the modern design area, the annual Beijing Design Week is set to work with the Triennale di Milano while Shanghai will also host a promotional exhibition of local designs.The ambassador also said he hoped that more and more Italians can travel to China, because he thinks it is a safe and modern place to visit, where mobile apps like Didi and e-payment make the trip easier and more convenient. “Although I am still new here, the first thing I learned is that WeChat is very, very important,” he said.
