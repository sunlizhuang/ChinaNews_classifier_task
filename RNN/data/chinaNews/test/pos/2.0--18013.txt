Every winter, black necked cranes fly to the Dashanbao Black Neck Crane National Nature Reserve in Zhaotong, Yunnan Province. After snowfall, the mountain meadows become a world of snow and ice. The black necked cranes flying through white snows and blue skies form an amazing ink painting.

As of Jan. 10, 2020, 1,433 black necked cranes had arrived in Dashanbao.

The black necked crane is an internationally recognized endangered animal. It is also a national key protected wild animal. Established in 2003, the Dashanbao Black Neck Crane National Nature Reserve is one of the largest winter habitats for black necked cranes in China.

In recent years, with the effective implementation of ecological projects such as returning farmland to forest and wetland restoration, the ecological environment of Dashanbao Nature Reserve has gradually improved, providing an ideal winter habitat for migratory birds. (Photo/People's Daily Online)
