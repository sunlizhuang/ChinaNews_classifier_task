Rolls-Royce's new Cullinan vehicle helped to push sales at the high-end car firm up by 25 per cent last year.

The super-luxury SUV, which costs a hefty £264,000, has been very popular since it arrived on the market last year and propelled sales of the luxury automaker's vehicles to their highest since the company's founding in 1904.

The continuing popularity of the company's Phantom model also helped boost annual sales at Rolls Royce by more than a thousand to 5,152. There were record sales in Russia, Singapore, Japan, Australia, Qatar and Korea.

Rolls-Royce's performance stands in sharp contrast to its rival Aston Martin, which expects earnings to be more than a quarter lower this year as the Warwickshire carmaker continues its struggle with poor sales.

It now expects adjusted earnings to fall from £196million last year to between £130million and £140million this year.

The firm says it will miss its profit targets after tough headwinds continued into December, a key month, even as Rolls-Royce posted a record year.

The business said that 'challenging trading conditions' it flagged up in November have not eased and, as a result, it has registered fewer sales, higher costs for selling each vehicle, and lower margins.

Chief executive Andy Palmer said the firm is taking numerous actions to try and turn itself around.

He said: 'This will include a cost saving programme alongside a focus on returning dealer stock levels to those more normally associated with a luxury company; winning back our strong price positioning is a key focus.'

In November last year, the firm blamed poor sales of the Vantage model and 'tough trading condition in the UK and Europe' on its faltering bottom line.

That same month, it opened a new factory in St Athan, Wales where its first SUV, the new DBX model will be built. The Welsh Assembly even paid for a new access road to the facility.

Palmer has said he hope the vehicle would possess strong appeal with multimillionaire women in China and the USA.

Aston Martin hopes this vehicle will turn around the company's fortunes. Between becoming a publicly traded company in October 2018 and the DBX coming on sale in November 2019, the firm's share price had declined by 75 per cent.

The new DBX model has a top speed of 181 mph, a 4.0 litre twin-turbo V8 engine and can go from 0-62mph in 4.5 seconds.

The auto manufacturer says there have been 'very encouraging' signs with the DBX after its launch. The vehicle has been touted as a competitor with the Rolls-Royce Cullinan.

The off-road Cullinan launched in 2018 and is named after the world's largest ever gem-quality rough diamond ever discovered.

It has a twin-turbocharged 6.75-litre V12 engine and is the first 'three-box' car in the SUV-sector according to Rolls Royce.

The automaker's chief executive Torsten Muller-Otvos said: ‘Worldwide demand last year for our Cullinan SUV has driven this success and is expected to stabilise in 2020.

‘It is a ringing testament to the quality and integrity of our products, the faith and passion of our customers and, above all, the skill, dedication and determination of our exceptional team at the Home of Rolls-Royce at Goodwood and around the world and our dedicated global dealer network.
