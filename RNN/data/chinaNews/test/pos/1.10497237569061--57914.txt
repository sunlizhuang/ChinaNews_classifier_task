Taipei, Feb. 6 (CNA) Health and Welfare Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said Thursday that the Taiwan government has asked the American drugmaker Gilead Sciences to reserve doses of its experimental drug Remdesivir for potential use in Taiwan, amid reports that the antiviral medication may be effective in treating the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

At a press conference, Chen confirmed the request to Gilead, while noting that the drug — which is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally — needs government approval before it can be used.

Originally developed for use against the Ebola virus, Remdesivir has been widely discussed in recent days as a possible coronavirus treatment, following positive results from Chinese and American doctors who have administered the drug experimentally.

On Jan. 31, Gilead said in a statement that it was working with the Chinese authorities to conduct a clinical trial involving the use of Remdesivir on coronavirus patients. [FULL STORY]
