Gifts from socks to world travel have been declared by Auckland Council staff.

OPINION: When is a gift too big? It is a touchy subject in the public sector and in Auckland has proved perilous at the top end of the scale.

Three years ago, two senior staff at Auckland Transport and a roading contractor were convicted on corruption charges over six- and seven-figure sums paid to the officials, but never declared, connected to the awarding of council contracts.

Roger MacDonald, the chief executive of the council development agency Panuku, resigned suddenly without explanation in 2019 after not declaring in advance that hospitality from a property developer included a helicopter trip to the Bay of Islands.

For most employees at Auckland Council, though, the perks are a merry and mostly modest mix, now able to be scrutinised online.

The council, and its family of agencies such as Auckland Transport and Watercare, all have policies on accepting gifts and hospitality – though the threshold varies.

Supplied Roger MacDonald, the former chief executive of the Auckland Council agency Panuku Development, resigned suddenly without explanation in 2019.

Auckland Council requires all gifts must be declared, permission must be given in advance for grander gestures, and hospitality must have a "justifiable business purpose."

Watercare does not allow anyone involved in procurement to accept gifts or hospitality, but while all gifts must be declared to managers, only those over $150 are recorded on the formal register.

So far, only the council itself has chosen to publish a quarterly list of gifts declared by its staff online.

Anything under $10 does not have to be declared and nor does small, branded merchandise such as pens or water bottles.

Law firms feature as generous hosts, such as the $1235 spent by DLA Piper to host 13 council legal staff for "social cooking".

Council-contracted lawyer Simpson and Grierson spent $1050 for drinks for 31 of the council's legal staff.

Rival diplomacy from Mainland China and Taiwan brought $4500 worth of travel from the Beijing Youth Foundation to take three council staff to the 2019 Beijing Sister City Youth Camp.

Meanwhile, from Taiwan, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office spent $1790 to host a council representative at the 2019 Ni-Hao Taiwan Study Program for Future Leaders.

Some gifts have a surprisingly high value. Two senior staff, hosted in the corporate lounge for a Warriors rugby league match, declared the worth as $1050.

Among the weighty and costlier items on the list are glimpses of genuine kindness.

"A small selection of baking goods" from a member of the public was declared by one staff member, putting a value of $25 on the gift.

Another cake – donor unknown – was declared as being worth $30, and a "box of tea leaves" was declared at $20.

Corporates have displayed an occasional sense of humour with lobbyist the NZ Property Council gifting two pairs of socks to a manager.

Some gifters are better than others at finding bargain-priced bottles of wine, with the priciest declared being a $28 bottle from an architectural firm, while the council's own senior advisory panel bought two for $30 for a council manager.

Accepting gifts is a recognised area of risk for public bodies like Auckland Council, and after the Roger MacDonald helicopter trip, Panuku called in consultants PWC, who are working through a review of the agency's gift and hospitality policies.
