BURIN, N.L. —

Guangming Weng is no stranger to the kitchen.

Weng, who goes by his English name Danny, is a Chinese cooking student at the College of the North Atlantic's campus in Burin

He studied a Chinese cooking program at the Guangzhou Tourism Commerce and Trade Vocational School from 2007 to 2010. Upon graduating, he worked as a chef until 2017 at the Crowne Plaza Guangzhou City Centre, an international five-star hotel in China.

In October 2017, Weng moved to Barrie, Ont. where he studied English as a second language at Georgian College. After completing the program he moved to Newfoundland where he spent seven months studying English at Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador before enrolling in the cooking program in Burin.

He decided to go back to cooking school to expand his knowledge of western cuisine.

Weng explained watching cooking shows helped spark this interest.

“I love the cooking program," he said. "I would watch the cooking show. It’s Gordon Ramsey. He is very, very nice cooking."

Weng, who resides in the college residence, said he enjoys living on the Burin Peninsula although he often has to rely on others to get him to where he needs to go off campus.

“It’s a very nice (town), but have a little bit of a problem with transportation," he said. "There’s no busing. Somebody needs to drive a car (to get around).”

Weng will be completed the cooking program in June or July. He is still uncertain where he will go from there.

“Maybe I will stay here and find work … or move back to China," he said. "But I’m not sure.”
