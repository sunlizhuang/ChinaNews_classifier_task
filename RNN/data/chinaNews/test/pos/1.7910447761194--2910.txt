Hannah Canham’s friends and clients are always asking her to spill her secrets. They want to know where she shops for vintage and how she sources her prized pieces, not only at home in Madrid, but also around the world. After living and working as a designer in New York for five years, Canham moved to Spain, founding her vintage business This Era Archive in 2018. She rents her pieces through her own space, as well as via pop-ups in New York and Paris and online. Last month, she published a vintage guide titled Treasures.

The little brown book culls recommendations from Canham herself, as well as from other experts around the globe, and it’s divided into sections by city. There are 25 total and five vintage shops for each. While recognizable fashion folk like founder of Lisa Says Gah Lisa Buhler; Object Limited creative director and cofounder Anna Z Gray; and the Webster founder Laure Heriard Dubreuil contributed their top spots, there are also more obscure suggestions from lesser-known names. Vintage fashion blogger Stella Yuhang included Shanghai outposts Lolo Love Vintage and Pawnstar. Shelly, Georgia, and Meila Hembrow of the sustainability minded label Wixii added their choices in Auckland, New Zealand. And vintage shops in Detroit, Tucson, and Joshua Tree also make the list. Tasmania is perhaps the most unexpected locale included in Treasures.

“One of the things that I discovered through making this book was how unique each city’s vintage scene is,” Canham says. “Each city has its own style, its own way of curating and covering different decades and representing different designers.” As for This Era Archive, Canham’s stock currently includes circa 1980s Mary McFadden, Schiaparelli from the 1940s, and 1970s-era Bonnie Cashin, along with Dior, Givenchy, Valentino, and Ossie Clark.

Canham opens the book with the phrase “seek and you shall find.” This handheld guide is a gift to vintage obsessives everywhere. Happy hunting.
