SEPANG: Malaysian aid organisation #OpsHarapan is sending about 2.4 tonnes of medical supplies to Wuhan to assist in the battle against the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) outbreak in China.

Its founder Ng Yeen Seen said the goods, comprising assorted face masks, goggles and medical supplies donated by the public, will be transported via flight MH386 from Kuala Lumpur to Shanghai Pudong tonight.

“After we launched the campaign last Friday, we managed to collect 338,000 surgical masks valued at about RM338,000, 540 N95 face masks with a value of RM4,320, 107,900 rubber gloves with a value of RM32,370 and 876 safety goggles with a value of RM34,922,” she told a press conference at the MASkargo headquarters, here today.

She said the goods, worth a total of RM409,612 or RMB696,340, were packed in 287 cartons and weighed about 2,400kg.

Also present were MASkargo chief executive officer Datuk Ibrahim Mohamed Salleh and executive director of Yunda Express Malaysia Datuk Luke Low Choon Pheng.

Ng said MASkargo and Yunda Express have footed the logistical bill to send the items to Wuhan, adding that a second batch of supplies might be sent later.

She said that #OpsHarapan is keeping open its donation drive to buy medical supplies to help Wuhan fight the outbreak, which has infected thousands and killed hundreds in China.

“We are very happy that MASkargo could help us, a grassroots NGO with no professionals. The donation (money) would be used to buy more medical supplies,“ she said.

Ng said MH386 would deliver the goods to the Shanghai Pudong International Airport before they are distributed to the Yunda Express Shanghai warehouse.

Yunda Express, a multinational transport company, will then coordinate with local authorities for the goods to be sent to hospitals in Wuhan and other parts of Hubei province, she added.

Meanwhile, Ibrahim said MASkargo was honoured to be part of #OpsHarapan as the company had been taking part in many relief aid missions, with the most recent ones being for victims of Taal Volcano eruption in Manila and bushfire victims in Australia.

He said its logistics support network had allowed relief aid teams to move efficiently and quickly to help those in need.

Ibrahim said MASkargo will ensure that the supplies reach the respective hospitals.

“In MASkargo we operate on one magic word, empathy, and with empathy, we can channel human kindness,” he said. - Bernama
