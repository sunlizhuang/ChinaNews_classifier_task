Edelman China has raised up two of its regional managing directors to top spots in its regional structure, elevating Mark Wang to CEO for China, and promoting Melinda Po to China chief growth officer.

Wang wiill lead business for the agency across its four China mainland offices, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.

“Mark is an outstanding leader and has driven double-digit growth leading our Beijing office over the last two years since he joined Edelman. With his years of experience on the client side managing large-scale businesses, marketing and communications functions, he brings a unique perspective on how to understand and tackle client business challenges,” said Stephen Kehoe, CEO Edelman Asia Pacific.

Wang, who currently serves as managing director for Beijing, commented on the new role saying:

“We are in the talent business. With the right talent and an intense focus on developing our people to understand and advise our clients on their growth and reputation agendas, I believe we will increasingly be distinct in our ability to not only promote our clients, but also evolve and protect them as well.”

Meanwhile, as its China chief growth officer, Po will be leading Edelman’s China Brand Hub which consolidates specialist resources across brand, strategy, creative, digital, and PR communications.

“Edelman is well-known for our leading corporate communications, issues and crisis management and B2B capabilities in China. However, since Melinda joined us two years ago, she has dramatically re-shaped our integrated communications capabilities. She has hired key talent and through differentiated work, earned the trust of marketeers that traditionally may not have thought of Edelman,” said Kehoe.

In addition to her new responsibilities, Po will also continue in her role as managing director of Edelman Shanghai.

Commenting on the appointment Po said, “Edelman truly understands the convergence of communications channels and the intersect between Brand and Reputation management. I am very excited to help our clients in China understand the importance of trust and what it means in today’s environment that changes at a pace never seen before.”
