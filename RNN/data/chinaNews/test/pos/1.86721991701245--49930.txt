Bruks Siwertell has completed the delivery of two high-capacity Siwertell 790 D-type unloaders. Ordered to ensure zero dust emissions and spillage-free coal handling, they now operate as a critical part of a large expansion project at the 3,800MW coal-fired Suizhong Power Plant in Liaoning, China.

“Seaside resorts and large coal handling facilities are not natural companions, but busy ports, space constraints and growing populations often require them to be, and when they are, some of the strictest environmental regulations come into force,” says Per Wahlström, Bruks Siwertell Contract Manager for the Suizhong project.

This was the issue faced by Suizhong Power Plant when it needed to expand. Located on the Bohai Sea, Liaoning is the most populous province in the region and its seaside resorts are particularly popular holiday destinations for people living in Beijing.

“No spillage or dust emissions from handling coal were allowed,” continues Mr Wahlström. “This is where Bruks Siwertell came in. The power facility approached us to see if our enclosed unloaders would meet the standards required, and they do.”

The initial contract was signed with Suizhong Power Generation Co Ltd and Shenhua in 2016. Since then, Shenhua has merged with another large Chinese energy company, Guodian; forming China Energy. The combined energy group owns one other smaller Siwertell unloader, which was delivered in 2018 to the Suqian power plant, formerly part of Guodian.

“Suizhong needed to increase its annual intake of coal to around six million metric tons in the most environmentally friendly way possible,” Mr Wahlström explains. “Previously, the coal was handled with grab cranes, and in comparison, our unloaders offered significantly higher rates of through-ship efficiency, environmental protection, shorter turnaround times for vessels, and cost savings.”

The two units ensure totally enclosed, dust-free coal handling and each offer a continuous rated capacity of 1,500t/h, serving vessels up to 50,000 dwt. They were delivered at the end of 2019 to accommodate the owner’s extended construction schedule and were transported fully assembled on a barge from Nantong.

“The most critical phases were loading and unloading the completely assembled units from the barge onto the power station’s new jetty using a floating crane. Safety precautions, effective preparation and good communication involving all parties are crucial in these operations,” he notes.

The jetty extends 2,500m out into the Bohai Sea and accommodates the unloaders on a 300m-berth along with transfer towers and new conveyors.

“The customer was very happy to receive the equipment and eager to put it into use,” says Mr Wahlström. “The unloaders have now been in service for a few months and early feedback on their performance is positive.”

Siwertell unloaders are known for their reliable, long service, particularly enhanced with good maintenance regimes; keeping the unloaders in peak condition is now being discussed with their new owners.
