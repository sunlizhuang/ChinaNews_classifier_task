Since arriving in Finland a year ago, Ajisen Ramen has opened restaurants in Panama and New Zealand as it continues its spread around the globe. Whether you’re passing through Helsinki Airport on a connecting flight, or looking to stay for the long haul, the restaurant remains a tasty and convenient option for travellers.

Around a year ago, Ajisen Ramen on of the popular restaurant chains in Asia opened its largest restaurant yet in the non-Schengen area next to the Aukio event space at Helsinki Airport. Whereas most of its 800+ outlets are small takeaway stalls, Ajisen Ramen’s restaurant at Helsinki Airport is by far the its biggest outlet in the world, and one of only two in Europe (the other is in Rome’s Fiumicino Airport). Spread across two entire floors, the restaurant has enough space to seat 217 people.

Having started out as a small ramen house in Kumamoto in Japan in 1968, Ajisen Ramen is now a global chain, and the third biggest fast casual brand in China. It still uses the original secret recipe for its famous Tonkotsu soup (pork broth) today, over 50 years later.

While the restaurant specialises in in ramen noodle soup dishes, it also has a lot more to offer. “Authentic ramen soups are the heart of Ajisen Ramen, but it also offers a wide selection of other delicacies from Asia, such as sizzling rice dishes and snacks,” says Johanna Sinerkari, Business Coordinator at SSP Finland. “Away from the hustle and bustle of the airport, you can enjoy a unique combination of Japanese and Scandinavian design, and excellent views of the runway.”

As all restaurants and shops at the airport, the restaurant was chosen by Finavia through public tender and supports the airport’s strategy to be a hub between Europe and Asia.

“As the number of passengers from China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore and South Korea have been growing at Helsinki Airport, there has been significant demand for this type of food,” says Sinerkari. “The brand is both familiar and popular among Asian passengers and its simple, tasty and convenient dishes have proven to be ideal for the travellers.”

Outside of Finland, Ajisen Ramen has outlets in Australia, Cambodia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Marianas, Mongolia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United States, Vietnam, Italy and Panama.
