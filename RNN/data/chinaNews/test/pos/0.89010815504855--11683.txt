UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy on Thursday asked parties in Yemen to stay on the course of political settlement.

Parties in Yemen need to work for the implementation of the Stockholm Agreement and the Riyadh Agreement and strive for an early restart of the UN-led all-round political process, said Wu Haitao, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations.

Despite setbacks in its implementation, the Stockholm Agreement between the government and Houthi rebels has played an important role in easing tension in Hodeidah governorate and promoting dialogue among Yemeni parties, Wu told the Security Council.

The December 2018 Stockholm Agreement must continue to be implemented, he said.

The implementation of the November 2019 Riyadh Agreement between the government and the Southern Transitional Council bears directly on political negotiations in the next step. China encourages Yemeni parties to jointly maintain solidarity and stability in the south to safeguard the country's sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity, he said.

Wu asked the international community to carry out robust mediation to help create the conditions for dialogue and negotiations among Yemeni parties.

The international community also should help improve the humanitarian situation in the war-torn country, said Wu. Enditem
