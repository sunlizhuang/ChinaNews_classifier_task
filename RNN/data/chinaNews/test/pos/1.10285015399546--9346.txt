At Memorial Coliseum on Tuesday, inquiring farmers wanted to know one thing.

Will 2020 be like 2019?

It's no wonder, said Rob Winters, farm director for WOWO-AM 1190, during a seminar on upcoming market and weather trends held Tuesday at the 31st annual Fort Wayne Farm Show.

Between rain that delayed or prevented planting and a late harvest, last year's growing season was “mostly awful” for area farmers, he said to his audience of about 200.

But experts at the show had hope for the upcoming season – in the form of better weather.

“Is it going to be like last year? No it is not,” said Ryan Martin, meteorologist with Hoosier Ag Today, during the session. “It's going to be more like a normal year.”

Martin said weather during planting in 2019 did not bring that much excess rain – about 2.5 extra inches in April through June in northern Indiana and about an inch more than that in northwest Ohio.

The problem was that rains came every couple of days, and soil never had a chance to dry out enough for planting.

“We will not duplicate this pattern” this year, he said.

Martin acknowledged last weekend's unseasonably warm weather made a mess of his January predictions. But he's sticking by his forecast for February and March.

He's calling for normal or slightly below normal precipitation and temperatures for February and slightly above normal precipitation and normal-to-below normal temperatures for March.

“The big question in March is, 'Is it going to be rain or snow?' The answer is 'Yes,'” he joked.

March has the best potential for “nasty” weather conditions and may come in and go out like the proverbial lion, Martin said.

However, April and May should bring near normal conditions in both precipitation and temperature, he explained, adding that he sees good windows for planting.

Overall, in April and May this year, “These are good growing conditions,” Martin said.

Jon Cavanaugh, marketing director for Central States Enterprises, said he was encouraged by a far-flung weather prediction – for Brazil.

The South American nation, with a growing season opposite that of the United States, has become a soybean export competitor of the United States and moreso since the trade war with China, which experts say has cost the U.S. about $12 billion in the last three years.

But dry weather conditions in South America lately may depress yields, Cavanaugh said. If yields go down and China comes back online as a major U.S. market, he said, “That is a lot more demand” for soybeans, and that could drive up prices.

“Today, the market is very skeptical that they (China) are going to do what they say they will do” in terms of upping purchases, Cavanaugh added.

David Kohli, an Ivy Tech adjunct agriculture professor, said he expects $4 a bushel this season as a good price for corn and $10 a bushel as a good price for soybeans.

He urged area farmers, if they have stocks of soybeans on hand, to hang onto them for a bit. Right now, “Beans are too cheap,” he said. But he thinks there's not much room for price increases in corn.

As for planting, Kohli said his best guess now is that farmers should plant typical full-season corn and soybeans and “plant them at normal times” – the last week of April and first week of May for corn and the middle to the end of May for soybeans.
