Café des Sciences lectures



As the Science Consulate of Switzerland in China, swissnex China held its New Year Café des Sciences on Thursday to wrap up its monthly lecture series initiated in 2019.



The program featured past speakers for their project updates, a keynote presentation from Stéphane Vernède, CEO at Enwise, and awards for community members with the highest attendance for the 2019 events, as well as a live performance.



Vernède shared the mechanism and science behind a modular digester for organic waste, specifically dry anaerobic digestion technology as well as real time IoT monitoring and control technology.



He said that "If the world is going to clean up its trash heaps, Shanghai's new program could well be the model."



Café des Sciences at swissnex China offers a monthly platform for Swiss spotlight scientists, start-ups, and artists to present their projects and connect with the local community.



Audiences are welcomed to enjoy networking reception with Swiss flavor after the talk. The lecture is scheduled to take place every third Thursday of each month at the swissnex China office or its partner spaces.
