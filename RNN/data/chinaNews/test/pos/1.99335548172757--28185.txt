These are the first pictures of what the largest ships ever to sail between Dover and Calais will look like.

The first of the new fleet of four 230-metre long superferries will be in use by 2023.

The vessels surface area will be three quarters as large as Trafalgar Square and provide room for 1,500 passengers

David Stretch, managing director for short routes at P&O Ferries, said: "These remarkable images provide a glimpse of the transformation which our customers will experience when they travel between Britain and Europe on the most sustainable, most reliable and most customer friendly ships ever to sail on the route."

"This major investment will be a vital part of Europe's transport infrastructure into the 2040s and symbolises our commitment to making trade flow for our customers."

The new ships are carbon neutral, cutting fuel use by 40% through a combination of fuel and battery propulsion.

They also have a heat recovery system and a power management system to close down parts of the ship when not in use.

The ships are also double-ended with two bridges so there is no need to turn around to dock.

The hull has a new shape and special propellers called azimuth thrusters, which increase manoeuvrability.

There are also outside deck areas which provide views of the White Cliffs of Dover.

The new ships were first announced last September after P&O signed a €260 million (£229m) contract with Chinese-based Guangzhou Shipyard International Ltd.

P&O Ferries sails 27,000 times a year on eight major routes between Britain, France, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Holland and Belgium.
