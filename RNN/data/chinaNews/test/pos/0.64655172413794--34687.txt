Aaron Gladd, the Democratic candidate for the state’s 43rd Senate District seat in the 2018 election, announced on Facebook last week that he would not seek a rematch with Sen. Daphne Jordan, R-Halfmoon, this November.

Gladd grew up in Saranac Lake.

“I have spent a lifetime of service to my country, my state and my community,” he wrote. “This year, knowing that our daughter will be starting kindergarten, and knowing firsthand the toll it will take to win and fight in Albany, we are going to take some time to step back and focus on family and health while serving a little closer to home.”

Preventing suicides

–

The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted Monday for legislation to direct the National Science Foundation to award competitive grants to colleges and universities to conduct research into the causes of suicide.

The legislation cited the fact that the rate of Americans dying by suicide has increased from 10.7 deaths per 100,000 people in 2001 to 14 per 100,000 in 2017. It is the 10th-leading cause of death in the United States and second-leading cause of death for young people between the ages of 15 and 34.

Stefanik voted in favor of the bill, which passed 385-8.
