High flying software group Altium has blamed the impact of the coronavirus and a slow start for its Octopart business for a downgrade to its financial forecasts.

Delivering its half-year results Atlium said it now expects full year revenues and profit margins to come in at the lower end of a previously stated range. Its shares had just hit a record high of $42.53 in anticipation of the announcement.

"They are still going to hit guidance but the share price has run so hard the market was likely expecting another upgrade," said Altium investor TMS Capital's Ben Clark after the announcement.

Altium confirmed that revenue would still be between US$205 million to US$215 million with an earnings before, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin of 39 per cent to 40 per cent.
