DHAKA, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina issued a statement on Saturday sending greetings and best wishes for a Happy Lunar New Year.

In her statement, Hasina said, "On the occasion of the Chinese Lunar New Year, I, on behalf of the people and the government of the people's Republic of Bangladesh and on my own behalf extend heartiest greetings to the people and the Government of the People's Republic of China."

The Bangladeshi premier said the Chinese new year is the most prominent traditional festival of the Chinese people marked by family reunion and celebrations.

"I wish the people of China all the prosperity and happiness in the New Year," she said.

"The cordial relation between Bangladesh and China is deeply rooted in our history and cultural exchanges," Hasina said.

The relations between modern China and today's Bangladesh were established on a solid foundation with the visit of the founder of the nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to China in the year 1952 and 1957, she said.

Bangabandhu was highly impressed with the enthusiasm of the Chinese people to build their country, which was reflected in his "unfinished memoir," said Hasina, daughter of Rahman.

Hasina said the year 2020 is very special for Bangladesh and China as the two countries would celebrate the 45th anniversary of the establishment of their diplomatic relations.

"On this auspicious occasion, I again wish the continued peace, progress and prosperity of the friendly people of China. Happy Chinese New Year and Congratulations." Enditem
