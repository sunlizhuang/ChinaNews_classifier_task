China Three Gorges (CTG) signed an offshore wind alliance with compatriot turbine OEM Ming Yang Smart Energy covering developments at home and abroad.

Described as a an “offshore wind power framework cooperation agreement”, the two Chinese groups said the deal will see them cement a long-standing relationship in the sector.

Zhang Jian, deputy general manager at Ming Yang International, said: “The cooperation framework agreement will be implemented in next few years through joint development in offshore wind energy sector in China, as well as overseas markets.

“CTG has been our key client for the past few years, this agreement will allow us to leverage the strength of each party to maximise the potential benefits derived from worldwide renewable energy development.”

A statement announcing the pact also refers to “onshore wind power, wind power industry upgrades and technological innovation”.

CTG – which takes its name from the famous hydro-dam – is one of China’s biggest developers, with an increasing footprint in the offshore wind sector. It has grabbed more than 7GW in the huge offshore wind pipeline planned off China, and is a pioneer in plans for floating wind off the nation’s coasts.

Like other large Chinese groups, CTG is also eyeing international expansion, including through an unsuccessful bid for full control of Portuguese utility EDP.

Ming Yang was China’s number-three turbine installer in 2019. Offshore it has a 7MW machine on the market, an 8MW prototype and recently raised funds to develop a 10MW turbine.
