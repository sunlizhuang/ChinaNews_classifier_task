BANGKOK (The Nation/ANN): The Department of International Trade Promotion is all set to organise the 65th Bangkok Gems & Jewellery fair from Feb 25 to 29, even though the novel coronavirus outbreak would reduce the number of Chinese participants, department director-general Somdet Susomboon said.

“Numerous exhibitors told us on Thursday [Feb 6] that they wanted to participate in the event, especially as the Hong Kong International Jewellery Show has been suspended, ” he added.

“This has made us extend our registration date until Feb 20.”

The department estimates that there would be a sharp fall in the number of Chinese buyers visiting the fair.

“However, I was informed that many US and EU participants have confirmed their participation, ” the director-general added saying that a total of 913 Thai and foreign companies had registered for the event.

“This number is up 2 per cent from last year.”

The Bangkok Gems & Jewellery Fair will be held at Impact Muang Thong Thani. To ensure the safety of participants, the department has teamed up with related parties to step up hygiene measures against the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.

Thermal scanners are being installed and thermal guns will be used at entrances and exits.

The venue will increase the frequency of disinfecting spots which are oftenly touched such as toilets, elevators and escalators. Face masks and sanitising gels will be available at many spots. - The Nation/Asia News Network
