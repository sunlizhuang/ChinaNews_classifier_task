The January 30th episode of the Chinese comedy show Roast! <吐槽大會> featured Taiwanese pop queen Elva Hsiao (蕭亞軒) on the floor, where she finally responded to the rumor that accused her of having over 17 different boyfriends in the last 16 years.

“I’ve never had that many boyfriends,” she said confidently before roasting herself. “I just get photographed whenever I’m out on a date at the movies or at dinner.”

She then dropped the punchline. “But if that’s your standard definition of a boyfriend, then I must’ve had at least a hundred boyfriends by now.”

Even so, the 40-year-old never minded dating rumors. On the show, she described herself as a “romantic little genius,” expressing that she enjoys meeting new friends and going out on dates. She would be the last one to be offended if one calls her as a woman with too many men in her life.

Indeed, the amount of dating rumors that Elva has had over the years are countless. A majority of her rumored boyfriends were also younger “little fresh meat.”

But rumors aside, Elva did confirm several long-term boyfriends. Her most famous ex-boyfriend by far was Taiwanese American actor Sunny Wang (王陽明), who is three years younger. The ex-couple met at a party and was introduced through a mutual friend. When they started dating, Sunny was still in college and did not know that Elva was a famous celebrity. They were in an on-again, off-again relationship for over three years before finally calling it quits in 2006. They remain good friends.

Another familiar ex was Kai Ko (柯震東), who is 12 years younger. They dated for approximately one year from 2012 to 2013.

Elva also dated Elroy Cheo (石正祥), who is 5 years younger. Elroy is the heir of a million-dollar business in Singapore.
