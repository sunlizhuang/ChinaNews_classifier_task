When asked why he is so keen for the coronavirus to be contained, he said China is a very close friend to Sierra Leone, a strong business partner for Sierra Leoneans and there are many Sierra Leonean students studying in china.

He said what is happening in China is something that Sierra Leone should take very seriously and if possible to help them.

“When I was Foreign Minister in 2014 when we had the ebola outbreak, I was the one receiving the Chinese supplies and personnel as they were so eager to help us win that battle. Now that they too have been caught with the coronavirus, we must show concern and be with them until they conquer this ungodly virus.”

He said he has seen some stories of Sierra Leonean students calling for the government to evacuate them. This, he said, is very difficult for the government and it will not even be encouraging for them to go through other countries before reaching Sierra Leone as it will be very difficult.

“I want all of you over there to stay calm and follow all the instructions given to you as the Chinese government is very particular of the foreigners that they are responsible for they will take very good care you all. Stay calm and make sure that all instructions given to you in your universities you follow them.”

Dr Samura Kamara said he hopes the government had issued a statement through the Chinese Embassy of their moral an unflinching support to the government and people of China for the coronavirus, because both countries have a strategic partnership and for all they have done for us.

“Even the rice saga going on now was given to us by the Chinese government to support the Free and Quality Education. This shows how close we are to China and if they are going through so many challenges we must show our concern and support to them.”

He said as for him he has reached out to his Chinese friends in and out of government and will continue to keep in contact with them and encourage them to be strong and continue to do what they do best in winning the battle against the coronavirus as they did with the SARS.
