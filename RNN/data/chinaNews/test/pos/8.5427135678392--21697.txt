This year, Mickey and Minnie are stepping out in style with Lunar New Year costumes designed by Chinese designer Guo Pei. You might have seen her elaborate designs on celebrities such as Rihanna, and at the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana last year.

Her award-winning work, which seeks to honor traditional Chinese culture, is very fitting for the Lunar New Year celebration at Disney California Adventure. The new outfits feature Chinese embroidery and auspicious red and gold hues.

“My inspiration comes from Chinese culture,” says Pei. “This is the Year of the Mouse. Also the year of Mickey and Minnie. Through my design, I wish to convey the richness of Chinese culture to the world. When Mickey and Minnie wear this new attire at Disneyland Resort, and children run forward to hug them, it shows the passion and love which directly connects people.”
