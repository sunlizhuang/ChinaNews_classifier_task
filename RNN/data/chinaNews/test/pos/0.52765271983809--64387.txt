A Hong Kong biotech company based in Guangzhou has developed new test kits for diagnosing the coronavirus with an accuracy of 99.9 percent.

Guangdong Hybribio Biotech is also ready to donate 3,000 of the kits to Hong Kong, pending approval by the food and health bureau.

The kits were trialed by hospitals in Guangdong and the Wuhan Institute of Virology over the past few weeks and diagnosed over 100 confirmed cases.

Director Kun Tit-sang said the firm has the capacity to make up to 200,000 test kits a day but is awaiting China Food and Drug Administration approval before mass production.

Upon approval, all mainland medical organizations can conduct diagnoses with the kits on their own, he said, adding Hong Kong could use the test kit as soon as local authorities approve it.

The company conducted over 5,000 tests in Guangdong since February 1 in collaboration with local authorities and discovered 10 positive cases, Kun said.

Senior consultant Chris Wong Lei-po said the test actually involves two tests - one for singling out suspected cases and another for confirmation.

Samples that test positive using the first test kit could be for the novel coronavirus, SARS or other bat-released coronaviruses.

The second uses a Sanger Sequencing Kit to identify the disease by comparing eight specific genes of the ne coronavirus.

"The first test takes 70 minutes, and the second takes around four to five hours depending on the laboratory's efficiency," Wong said.

Kun said the price could be a fraction of the HK$55 test kits invented by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Last week, HKUST researchers announced they had produced the world's fastest portable 2019-nCoV detection kit, which can detect the virus in 40 minutes.

The device is deemed safe for launch in Hong Kong and is already used by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Shenzhen and Guangzhou.

"I can only say the production cost for each set of test kits will be 50 percent, or even lower, than the ones developed by the university," Kun said.
