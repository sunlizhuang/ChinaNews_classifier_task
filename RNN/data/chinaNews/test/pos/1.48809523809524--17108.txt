Turkcell recently demonstrated its commitment to the ethical and responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, which will be embedded to core business procedures and technologies.

The initiative aims to make the company one of the key global contributors to AI ethics and also the first in the country to announce concrete AI principles.

Turkcell CMO, Omer Barbaros Yis, said: “AI should be raised like children and we commit to teach better as responsible parents. Today we share our principles and our commitment to help AI have socially beneficial impacts for our customers and society at large.

“We are proud to become the first company to contribute to AI ethics in Turkey. The field will continuously expand and we will witness its transformative impacts in our daily lives. Backed by our experience in digital transformation and creating next-generation technologies, we will continue to drive a positive direction towards its advancement and help overcome public concerns about the field.”

Last November, Zhao Dachun, the vice general manager of China Mobile, expressed his thoughts on the rollout of 5G during the third China Enterprise Reform and Development Forum. Highlighting research data from IHS Markit, which predicts 5G to help grow $12.3 trillion globally across sectors by 2035, Zhao said: “5G will become the aorta of the information society, the accelerator of the industrial transformation, and the footstone of digital society.”

Xiaomi recently announced that it would invest more than 50 billion yuan in 5G and AI in the coming five years. The company has long held a vision around the convergence of 5G, artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things, advocating for an ‘all in AIoT’ (AI + IoT) approach.
