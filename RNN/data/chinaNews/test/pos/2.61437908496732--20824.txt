The Chinese embassy in Kingston has fired back at Washington's top diplomat US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who on Wednesday urged Caribbean countries to be wary of accepting easy money from countries like China.

Mr. Pompeo made the comment while addressing a policy discussion before ending his visit to Jamaica.

In a statement, the Chinese embassy said it has observed that some US politicians have been tarnishing China's reputation.

It said China has been carrying out cooperation with Latin America and the Caribbean on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.

It added that the cooperation has been open and transparent as well as in compliance with local laws and market rules.

The Chinese embassy said Latin America and the Caribbean countries have the right to determine their own foreign relations including choosing their trade and investment partners.
