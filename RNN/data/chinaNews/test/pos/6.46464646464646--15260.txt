Vancouver is lucky in that its multicultural makeup makes for some of the best festivals a city can offer, including Lunar New Year.

With 2020, comes the Year of the Rat, the first of all zodiac animal symbols. In Asian culture, the rat is associated with the “Earthly Branch” and midnight hours and, in the terms of yin and yang, represents the beginning of a new day. Here are just a few suggestions for celebrating Lunar New Year in Vancouver.

The Chinese New Year Parade takes place Jan. 26 in Chinatown.

Chinese New Year Parade

The 47th annual Chinese New Year Parade takes place Sunday, Jan. 26 in Chinatown. This signature event features lion dances, cultural dance troupes, marching bands, martial arts performances and much more. The parade begins at 11 a.m. A highlight of the parade is the largest assembly of traditional lion dance teams in Canada with dozens of colourful and energetic lions from various local fraternal and martial arts organizations.

The parade includes 70 entries — bringing more than 3,000 participants from various community and cultural groups — including multicultural dance troupes, the Vancouver Police Department Motorcycle Drill Team, marching bands and various community groups. It is not surprising that the parade draws over 100,000 spectators along the route each year.

The 1.3 kilometre parade route starts at the Millennium Gate on Pender Street (between Shanghai Alley and Taylor Street), proceeds east along Pender Street, turns south onto Gore, turns west onto Keefer and then disperses on Keefer at Abbott. See map here

Post-parade lion dances

You won’t want to miss the lion dances throughout Chinatown after the parade. As a Chinese New Year tradition to promote good fortune for the year, some lions will be visiting shops and businesses in Chinatown to perform a celebratory dance to bring good luck and prosperity. The dancing starts right after the parade and will run from approximately 2 to 4 p.m.

Vancouver Chinatown Spring Festival — Cultural Fair

By popular demand, the Cultural Fair will be held on both Jan. 25 and 26, with multicultural performances, special lion dance grand finale, martial arts demonstration and more at Sun Yat-Sen Plaza, 50 East Pender St.

Jan. 25: 2 to 4 p.m.

Jan. 26: 2 to 4 p.m.

All events of the 2020 Vancouver Chinatown Spring Festival are open to the public. The Chinese New Year Parade and the Cultural Fair are free to attend.

Yellow Peril: The Celestial Elements

Yellow Peril: The Celestial Elements is a visual art exhibit inspired by the Chinese Five Elemental forces, “seized by the urgent tensions between Queer Chinese diasporic identities.”

The exhibit is a collection of multi-channel installations, including visual and sculptural activations created to provoke a cosmic encounter of our living past and present as we “race towards a healing future.”

“These elemental activations attempt to collapse the linear temporality to dislodge an emotional, spiritual, cosmological, and metaphysical enunciation of our Queer ‘Chineseness.’ Rather than focus on the trauma that queer people of colour face, this project is fundamentally an invitation to an exuberant celebration of queerness that is unabashedly Chinese.”

Feb. 1, 4 to 6 p.m.: opening

Feb 2, 5 p.m.: curator tour

Feb 15: Yellow Peril film screening and artist talk

March 7: Community food sharing

April 4: Grave Sweeping activation

Yellow Peril is at SUM Gallery, 425-268 Keefer St., from Feb. 1 to April 18.
