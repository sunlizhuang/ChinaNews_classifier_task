Besides selling books, the Chinese pavilion at Bangla Academy premises at the Amar Ekushey Book Fair-2020 has turned into a place for cultural exchange and interaction. People of all ages, particularly the youth, are gathering in front of the pavilion and browsing through books about China.

Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Bangladesh and Bangladesh Bureau, China Media group jointly set up the stall at Ekushey Book Fair for the first time.

“Selling books is not our top priority. As the relation between Bangladesh and China is developing day by day, we feel responsible for helping the Bangladeshi readers know easily about China,” Zha Mingwei, Third Secretary of Cultural section of Chinese Embassy in Dhaka told UNB.

He said many visitors are gathering at the stall to buy books for children about language, Chinese history and culture in particular. “We offer the books at more affordable prices than at other times,” he said.

The pavilion also sells Chinese gifts and souvenirs to promote the exchange of cultural products.

Among the books, Xi Jinping: The Governance of China, China’s Culture, China in the next 30 Years, Healthy China: 1949-2019, Where is China Going, Studying in China, China Creative Digest and Chalkbazar to China (written in Bengali), among others, are attracting the visitors most.

Rasel Sharker, a third year student of Dhaka University, was buying a book from the stall. “I’ve bought a book on higher study at China as I want to do my masters there. As the Chinese government is offering lots of scholarships for international students, Bangladeshi students are becoming interested about China,” he said.

He said the prices at the Chinese pavilion are lower than the stores outside the fair, adding that visiting the pavilion is very useful for those searching books about Chinese culture, history and study.

Praising the initiative, Md Delwar Hossain, president of Bangladesh-China Friendship Centre, said a lot of Chinese people are working in different development projects in Bangladesh while the number of Bangladeshi students and workers is also increasing in China. “The move to set up a Chinese stall at the book fair will be helpful for both countries,” he said.
