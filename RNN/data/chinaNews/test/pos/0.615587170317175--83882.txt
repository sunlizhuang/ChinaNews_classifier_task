CANTON The new CommQuest Services detox center at Aultman Hospital will get its first patients this week.

CommQuest and Aultman officials held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the facility Friday evening.

CommQuest President and CEO Keith Hochadel said he and the agency were grateful and excited to partner with Aultman.

"Relationships like this just show how far our community has come in reducing stigma around getting treatment," Hochadel said.

The facility on the sixth floor of Aultman Hospital has 20 beds, and will treat patients detoxing from alcohol, opioids or benzodiazepines. Patients will start moving in on Wednesday.

The detox is located in Aultman’s former psychiatric ward. There are 10 patient rooms, along with offices, a lounge area and a nurses’ station. Counseling and medication-assisted treatment will be available around the clock.

“If it’s two o’clock in the morning and somebody calls or somebody walks up and says, ‘I need help,’ I feel that it’s our obligation to be there to help them out,” Hochadel said.

CommQuest expects to treat 750 patients a year at the Aultman Hospital detox. Before patients leave the detox, they will be linked to ongoing treatment. The average length of stay will be two weeks.

The detox beds had been housed at CommQuest’s ReCOR facility in Massillon. ReCOR will continue to provide outpatient treatment.

The Aultman detox center is CommQuest’s second around-the-clock, hospital-based detox in Stark County. A similar facility opened at Aultman Alliance Community Hospital in 2017.

“It’s something that we definitely need here at Aultman and in our community,” said Shelley Johnson, Aultman vice president of regulatory and behavioral health. “I know we’ll have a lot of success stories to come in the future.”

Having a detox center in a hospital allows patients who come to the emergency room for an overdose to move directly into detox without having to go to a different site.

At the same time, detox patients can get medical treatment without leaving the hospital.

"Hopefully we'll be navigating more people to treatment by having a presence in the hospital,” said Wendy Hunter, detox director.

Roughly 25 CommQuest employees will work in the detox unit, including nurses, counselor and social workers.

Stark County Mental Health and Addiction Recovery Executive Director John Aller said the agency would fund treatment at the facility for patients who aren’t covered by Medicaid or private insurance.
