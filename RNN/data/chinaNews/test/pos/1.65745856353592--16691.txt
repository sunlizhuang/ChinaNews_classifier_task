Taipei, Jan. 21 (CNA) President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) said Monday she could consider meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) as long as the two met on an equal footing.

In an interview with SET News, Tsai reiterated she would be willing to meet with Xi based the four principles she said were needed to stabilize the relationship across the Taiwan Strait: "peace," "parity," "democracy" and "dialogue."

"We hope cross-strait interactions will take place based on such a foundation (of the four principles)," Tsai said. "We will consider any form of interaction (with China)" based on the four principles.

Tsai of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), won a second term on Jan. 11 by nearly 20 points over her closest rival, Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜) of the China-friendly Kuomintang (KMT). [FULL STORY]
