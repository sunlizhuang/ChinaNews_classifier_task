A Wirral solicitor is preparing to walk along the Great Wall of China to raise money for cancer care organisation Maggie’s.

Claire Currie, managing partner of Kirwans law firm, is hoping to raise at least £3,000 for the charity, which provides support, information and practical advice to anyone who has been affected by cancer.

Now the mum-of-two is embarking on regular training sessions in order to take on the seven-day challenge with her sister, Helen Gibbs, in October.

It costs £590,000 every year to keep a Maggie’s centre open, and the funds raised during the expedition will go towards their vital work.

Claire said: “With millions of steps and uneven, broken areas of the wall to navigate, it’s fair to say that walking the Great Wall of China will be a huge challenge on my already broken knees.

“But that challenge is nothing compared to the challenge of facing your own or a loved one’s cancer diagnosis. That’s why I am so passionate about supporting Maggie’s.

“It is so hard to describe just how extensive the support is that the centre gives, but it is a lifeline for so many people. Offering everything from support groups to practical help on topics such as make-up, wigs, knitting and wills, Maggie’s is a lifeline for so many people facing the most difficult period of their lives.

“Equally as important is the cake, cuppa and chat that’s always on offer too.

“This is an exciting year for Maggie’s Merseyside as they have outgrown their Wirral centre and are in the process of building a new one on the current grounds.

“I am very privileged to run the wills clinics for the centre, and I have never met such an amazing group of people. They are totally dedicated to helping others, which is why I am so keen to help raise money for them.”

This is the second year running that Claire has taken on a challenge for Maggie’s; last year she took part in Strictly Maggie’s at the Titanic hotel, which saw 16 participants pair up with professional dancers to compete for the chance to win the Strictly crown under the watchful eye of celebrity guest Shirley Ballas, who was in attendance.
