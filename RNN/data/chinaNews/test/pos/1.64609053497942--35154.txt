The US House of Representatives has voted to authorize sanctions against Chinese officials who meddle in choosing the Dalai Lama's successor, raising pressure as Tibet's spiritual leader approaches 85.

Under the legislation, Washington would freeze US assets and ban travel to the United States of Chinese officials involved in "identifying or installing" a government-approved Dalai Lama.

The act, backed by 392 lawmakers against 22, needs approval from the Senate before going to President Donald Trump for his signature.

The law would also prohibit China from opening more consulates in the United States until Washington can open a mission in Lhasa.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a longtime advocate for Tibet, said the bill aims to encourage Beijing to resume dialogue with envoys of the Dalai Lama.

It is the latest rights bill passed in the US Congress after an act in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters.

The 14th Dalai Lama, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, has a wide following through his good-humored discourses.

Beijing has signaled it could try to manage his succession - a ritualistic search by monks for a young boy.

The Dalai Lama has said he is open to a successor being chosen before he dies or declaring the institution finished with him.

In 1995, Beijing selected a Panchen Lama - another top Tibetan Buddhist position - and held a six-year-old for the role. Rights groups described him as the world's youngest political prisoner.
