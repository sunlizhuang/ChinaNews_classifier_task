New York Times international editor Michael Slackman and business editor Ellen Pollock sent out the following announcement on Tuesday:

When we started searching for a new Asia business editor four years ago, several reporters were unanimous in their recommendation: Carlos Tejada.

The choice was equally easy when we needed a new deputy Asia editor.

Smart, driven, kind and devoted, Carlos is the ultimate reporter’s editor. He is committed to his team, an unending advocate for their work and their voice. He is the consummate collaborator, willing to jump on anything if needed.

Carlos’s new role solidifies our commitment to breaking down barriers at The Times — and creating a truly integrated, global newsroom. As the deputy, he will continue to oversee our business report in Asia. But he will also help drive our broader international coverage with Adrienne Carter, working with reporters across our various bureaus.

In the same vein, editors in the Hong Kong newsroom who have traditionally focused on international will expand their portfolios to include business news and enterprise, working more closely with the business reporters. Much of this has already been happening in Hong Kong, as we have worked to create a more seamless operation. Now we are evolving our structure to match our goals.

And Carlos is the perfect partner to help reinvent our Hong Kong newsroom, with the right mix of business and international experience.

Carlos spent two decades at The Wall Street Journal as a reporter and an editor. Since joining The Times in 2016, he has been a force behind some of our most ambitious business stories in Asia, helping guide our coverage on the trade war, techno-authoritarianism, the slowing Chinese economy and the saga of Carlos Ghosn.

Please join us in congratulating Carlos on his new role.
