MINSK, 11 February (BelTA) – Belarus-China cooperation in the sphere of education advances dynamically. Belarusian Education Minister Igor Karpenko made the statement during the ceremony held in the Minsk State Linguistic University (MSLU) on 11 February to close the Year of Education of Belarus in China, BelTA has learned.

The official said: “Today as we sum up results of the Year of Education of Belarus in China we can say with pride that the decision to organize the year was undoubtedly correct, that the intensification of our movement towards each other in the sphere of education has reached unprecedented heights. We do have something to be proud of and take good care of in our relations.”

In his words, so far Belarusian and Chinese universities have signed over 400 direct agreements on cooperation, with 32 agreements signed in 2019. More than 40 delegations of Chinese educational institutions visited Belarus last year while over 30 Belarusian delegations visited the People's Republic of China. The legal base of cooperation was expanded with an intergovernmental agreement on the mutual recognition of academic certificates and academic degrees. “During the fifth joint session of the education cooperation commission of the Belarus-China intergovernmental cooperation committee in May 2019 we had an opportunity to not only compare notes, but also work out a number of important decisions to determine the advancement of bilateral interaction in the future,” the education minister noted.

Tight cooperation of Belarusian and Chinese educational institutions has resulted in over 20 joint university education programs and over 10 post-graduation university education programs. The possibility of jointly training top-qualification scientists is under consideration. The opening of an institute at premises of the Belarusian State University in association with the Dalian Polytechnic University represents another step in the process of establishment of joint educational institutions.

Scientific personnel from Belarusian and Chinese universities use joint research labs to carry out research projects in order to accomplish tasks of mutual interest in realms of scientific knowledge, including during joint scientific research contests arranged by Belarusian and Chinese governments. Work is nearing completion to open two more labs like that.

“Taking into account the implementation of Belarusian-Chinese investment projects and the largest joint project – the China-Belarus industrial park Great Stone – today there is a great demand for technical specialists not only with excellent expertise in their field but with fluent Chinese. This is why the Belarusian National Technical University in association with the Confucius Institute on Science and Technology operating at the university's premises has implemented an ambitious project to compile a Russian-Chinese-English dictionary of technical terms during the Year of Education of Belarus in China,” Igor Karpenko said.

Three Belarusian studies center and a Belarusian-Chinese research center were opened at premises of Chinese universities as part of the Year of Education of Belarus in China. Preparations are nearing completion to open a Confucius Institute at premises of the Brest State A.S. Pushkin University and convert a Confucius classroom operating at premises of the Belarusian State University of Physical Culture into a Confucius Institute. The Chinese studies institute of the Belarusian State University is about to publish a textbook to teach Belarusian to Chinese students.

Two facilities built thanks to China's gratuitous aid – a new building of the Chinese studies institute of the Belarusian State University and a student hall of residence of the Belarusian National Technical University – were solemnly opened in autumn 2019. Apart from that, over 30 official events of mutual interest were held in 2019 with participation of top officials of the education ministries and representatives of the academic community of Belarus and China. Those included conferences, roundtables, contests of creative and scientific work, seminars, and exhibitions.

Igor Karpenko stressed that the implementation of the Year of Education of Belarus in China had allowed substantially increasing the dynamics of bilateral cooperation in the sphere of education and university science. It also allowed enhancing direct ties between universities. A colossal potential for further advancement for the benefit of the two countries was formed after a number of mutually beneficial projects were implemented. “I am convinced that, as we continue moving towards each other following the established policy, we will even more strongly reinforce the foundation for the development of political, trade, economic, and investment ties, which the sphere of education surely is,” he added.

Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of China to Belarus Cui Qiming noted that the organization of the Year of Education of Belarus in China was of much importance for advancing interaction in the sphere of education. In 2019 nearly 40 higher education institutions from 25 provinces and oblasts of Belarus and China jointly organized over 100 events. A huge number of professors and students from China and Belarus took part in them. It had a positive effect and took Belarus-China cooperation to new heights, the ambassador noted. “May today's event become another starting point. We continue walking hand in hand and will make an even greater contribution to the development of the sphere of education of the two countries and to stronger friendship between our nations,” Cui Qiming said.
