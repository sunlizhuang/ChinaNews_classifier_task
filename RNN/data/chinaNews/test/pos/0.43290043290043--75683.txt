The federal government's move follows calls from the industry for help and comes as Queensland unveiled on Tuesday a $27 million rescue package for its tourist operators to help them recover from the economic losses associated with the virus.

Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk called on Prime Minister Scott Morrison to match the funding which includes $7 million for an international marketing campaign, money for specific regions popular with Chinese tourists such as North Queensland and the Gold Coast, as well as $3.7 million for financial counselling and support.

Ms Palaszczuk said she had written to Mr Morrison to not only match the new funding but also activate the Disaster Recovery Allowance.

"Queensland has been hit hard by the coronavirus. Federal support would not only double the value of tourism marketing, it would allow us to provide a $2000 resilience grant for up to 8700 small businesses across impacted areas," she told state Parliament.

"And it would trigger $700,000 in export grants for small-to-medium enterprises, allowing them to travel to China and reconnect with key partners once the borders re-open."

Tourism bodies have urged the federal government to double financial assistance to the industry, saying the $76 million allocated to Tourism Australia was on the back of the summer of bushfires.

It comes as new figures show 1.438 million Chinese tourists visited Australia in the year to December.

Updated visitor numbers showing the impact of the coronavirus won't be available until the middle of the year, but tourism bodies predict the losses are about $1 billion a month from the Chinese travel ban.

Australian Tourism Industry Council chief Simon Westaway said the overseas visitor arrivals numbers marked the high point for international tourism for the foreseeable future.

"ATIC’s strong concern remains for many Australian tourism enterprises, particularly in our regions and how they’re coping, given the dramatic slide in Chinese visitors that has been occurring," he said.

The plea to assist the industry came as Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials finalised details for an evacuation flight of Australian passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship riddled with coronavirus cases.

Health Minister Greg Hunt said indications were about 200 people would take up the government's offer of the Qantas charter flight, expected to leave Japan on Wednesday.

He said they would be screened five times for the virus within a 24 hour window – before they leave the ship, twice on the flight, when they land at the RAAF base in Darwin and a final test at the quarantine centre at Howard Springs, where they will stay a fortnight.

Mr Hunt confirmed that if Australians did not take up the offer of the charter flight, they would have to spend another two weeks away from Australia before being allowed back in the country.
