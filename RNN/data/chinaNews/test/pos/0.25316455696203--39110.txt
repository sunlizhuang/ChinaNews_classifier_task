With the announcement of allowing Huawei to partially participate in its 5G network construction, the United Kingdom became the first “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing ally to openly defy the Trump administration’s call for a total ban of the Chinese telecom giant.

Despite the relentless pressure and threat from the United States, including personal calls from President Trump, and opposition from his own party, Prime Minister Boris Johnson demonstrated courage and leadership by making a decision based on Britain’s national interests and security risk calculations.

The U.K. decision on how to manage Huawei’s presence has significant global implications. First, it sets an example of not blindly following Washington. Instead of a total ban or a totally open option, U.K. permits Huawei to have up to 35 per cent of its 5G market share in the non-core security areas while listing the company as a high risk entity with close monitoring in place. This approach is a careful compromise between meeting the U.S. demands and not damaging relations with China.

Second, it puts British economic interests first with a set of measures to mitigate security risks. Up to now, all four major U.K. telecom providers have business collaborations with Huawei in their existing operations. Taking Huawei out will incur substantial cost while there are not enough alternatives.

Even with partial inclusion of Huawei in its 5G networks, it is estimated that the immediate benefits to the British economy will be well over $1.7 billion CAN. With the uncertainty ahead after the Brexit, the U.K. has sided with pragmatism over ideological rigidity.

Third, the U.K. decision on Huawei is likely to have an “AIIB Effect” globally. In 2015, China launched the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank initiative, and the U.S. fiercely lobbied its allies not to join. But Britain broke rank with the U.S. and joined the AIIB, leading to other U.S. allies, including Canada in a later date, to join the new global institution.

Today, like then, many countries are watching Britain closely on the Huawei move, and they are likely to be relieved to see such a hybrid solution, that is to allow a certain level of Huawei participation while implementing enough mechanisms to guard against potential risks involved.

What about Canada’s pending decision on Huawei’s involvement in our own 5G networks? Following the EU and the U.K.’s gentle rebuff of Washington’s bullying over Huawei, it is time for Ottawa to take its own stand.

Given the circumstances, this should be pragmatic and based on self-interest. We should not succumb to President Trump’s hectoring to retreat into the primitive cave of fortress North America when the U.S. has no viable 5G alternative on offer, nor should we be wooed by Huawei’s founder Ren Zhengfei’s promise to make Canada its North American R&D base.

Huawei technology is neither a gift nor a Trojan horse. Instead, we should look it straight in the mouth and promptly bridle it through regulation because 5G technology is both an opportunity and a risk.

Since much of Huawei’s 5G technology was developed right here in Canada by engineers formerly employed by Canada’s flagship technology enterprise Nortel, we should not undermine Canada’s technology competitiveness through an outright ban.

At the same time, we need to understand, evaluate and mitigate the risks of technology co-operation with Huawei and other firms and bodies associated with the Chinese state.

Canada’s interests lie both with an open competitive system and robust research collaboration but we must also be vigilant and closely monitor Chinese research partnerships here to ensure that Canadians retain intellectual property and to prevent leakages of sensitive technology to the detriment of our own interests and those of our allies. We should ride this horse rather than locking it out but should steer it where we want to go.

The core issue is regulating 5G technology at the national and the international levels. Washington’s pressuring of its allies has been a distraction from the real issues at stake.

We need a robust system for registering and monitoring research partnerships but not one that is completely in the hand of security agencies. A model, like the Tri-council research ethics system, may work with monitoring by a special body with representatives from industry, academia and government, that also include security agencies.
