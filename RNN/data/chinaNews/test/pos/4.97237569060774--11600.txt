As part of our pioneering information-sharing agreement with leading Chinese consumer platform Globuy, a selection of our stories with key Moodie Davitt brand partners appears on Globuy’s weekly ‘Duty Free News Flash’ column.

Globuy aims to become “the KOL of Chinese travel retail” and already has 400,000 followers and a monthly audience of 1 million views for its WeChat social media platform promoting new launches, product availability, promotions and special offers.

This week’s Duty Free News Flash begins with some exclusive coverage from Shanghai Pudong International Airport, as Dior and Armani Beauty unveil two eye-catching pop-ups in the key Chinese gateway.

The pop-ups were launched in partnership with CDF-Sunrise Duty Free and can be found in Terminal 1 of Shanghai Pudong Airport. Both pop-up stores were launched in January and will run until the end of February.

The Armani Beauty pop-up is hard to miss and shines the spotlight on three different interpretations of Armani Beauty’s signature red shade. These are the Si Passione fragrance, the Lip Maestro lipstick, and the My Armani To Go Cushion Foundation.

According to Globuy, Armani Beauty’s best-selling 405G, 405, and 206 Lip Maestro shades – which are in high-demand in both domestic and travel retail markets – are showcased at the pop-up.

The 405G red lipstick shade is Armani Beauty’s latest limited-edition release; its formula is enhanced with refined golden pearls and comes in exclusive gold-lacquered packaging.

The Armani Beauty pop-up also offers exclusive gift-box packaging to mark Chinese New Year. This allows customers to mix and match different products and create their own personalised Armani Beauty sets. The experience is completed with a free mini lip gloss or mini Si Passione fragrance sample, packaged in a lucky red envelope, as an exclusive gift with purchase.

Elsewhere in T1, luxury fashion and beauty house Dior has launched a spectacular beauty, fragrance and skincare pop-up store. The multi-faceted Dior pop-up highlights the brand’s Miss Dior Rose N’ Roses fragrance, the Dior Prestige Skincare Collection, and its ‘biggest-ever skincare discovery’, the Capture Totale C.E.L.L. Energy Collection.

As reported, an ambitious launch programme for the Capture Totale C.E.L.L. Energy collection is being supported by a series of pop-ups in key travel retail doors, including Shanghai Pudong.

The pop-up was launched in partnership with CDF-Sunrise Duty Free and features high-impact retailtainment via various touchpoints. These include Capture Totale beauty classes, skincare consultations and gift personalisation.

Other Dior Capture Totale activations are planned in Beijing Daxing Airport in partnership with China Duty Free Group and in Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport in partnership with King Power Thailand.

According to Globuy, Dior’s newly launched Capture Total C.E.L.L. Energy range has been gaining popularity amongst Chinese customers thanks to the promotions of top Chinese KOL Li Jiaqi.

Globuy continues its report by reviewing key products from Dior’s Capture Totale C.E.L.L. Energy range. It began its review with the Super Potent Serum, followed by the Moisturising Firming Cream, the Eye Lifting Cream, and the High Performance Gentle Cleanser.

The Dior Capture Totale pop-up also offers a variety of exclusive gifts with purchase. For every purchase totalling ¥1500, customers can receive a three piece Capture Totale C.E.L.L. Energy gift set. In addition to this, they can also participate in a raffle draw for a chance to win a pair of exclusive Dior Earrings.

The Duty Free News Flash then moves onto Paris, where Chanel has opened a new boutique at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport. The 170sq m boutique is located in Terminal 2E by Gate L and officially opened on 20 December.

Globuy also shared our story on Louis Vuitton’s duplex store in Hong Kong International Airport. As reported, Louis Vuitton is to proceed with the opening of its duplex store at Hong Kong International Airport later this year; despite widespread media reports that the luxury house is to close its downtown Causeway Bay store due to the commercial fall-out from months of social unrest.

Elsewhere in Asia, Globuy posted our story on Malaysia Airports-owned travel retailer Eraman, which has opened new boutiques in partnership with leading brands Dior, Lancôme and Swarovski at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) plus an Estée Lauder store at Kota Kinabalu Airport.

The KLIA stores, which opened in departures Level 5 on 19 December, cover 2,438sq ft (Dior 947sq ft, Lancôme 818sq ft and Swarovski 673sq ft). The openings are the latest additions to the retail portfolio under the airport company’s Commercial Reset strategy

Finally, the Duty Free News Flash concludes in South Korea, where Shinsegae Duty Free has revealed plans to enter the downtown duty free market in Jeju Island. The company said that if it is successful in obtaining a duty free licence, the sales floor at its earmarked location will be around double that of existing downtown duty free stores operated by Lotte Duty Free and The Shilla Duty Free in Jeju.
