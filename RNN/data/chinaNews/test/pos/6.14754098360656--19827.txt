As part of an exchange program with Shenyang Aerospace University in China, Saginaw Valley State University is hosting an art exhibition featuring paintings and lacquerware that explores culture and memory, among other themes.

The artwork of Shenyang Aerospace University professors Li Shaohong and Liu Wei is on display now at the SVSU University Art Gallery, located on the first floor of SVSU's Arbury Fine Arts Center. The exhibition, titled "Images from China," ends Friday, Feb. 7.

Since 2012, Shaohong has been featured in solo exhibitions at galleries in the U.S. and China. His paintings focus in part on childhood dreams and memories as well as history and cultural traditions.

Wei specializes in lacquerware, which are objects -- such as containers and tableware -- decorated with intricate designs. Through his art, Wei attempts to make connections between the northern and southern Chinese cultures while focusing on the concept of fate.

Shenyang Aerospace University has an articulation agreement with the SVSU art department in graphic design, allowing Chinese students the opportunity to spend two years at SVSU. As part of this agreement, the two professors were chosen to share their artwork at SVSU.

The University Art Gallery is open 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Mondays through Fridays.
