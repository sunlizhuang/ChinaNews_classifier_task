The Myanmar version of China: Time of Xi, a documentary about China's governance, was introduced on January 16 in Yangon ahead of President Xi Jinping's state visit to the country.

Speaking at a ceremony marking its release, Xu Lin, deputy head of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and minister of the State Council Information Office, said the documentary will help the people of Myanmar learn more about China's governance under the leadership of Xi and about the country's development experience.

The documentary was a hit in China and abroad after being broadcast on several global media platforms. It will be broadcast on Myanmar's Skynet TV from Thursday to Saturday.

The documentary comes to Myanmar as the two countries celebrate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties this year. Its release was timed to coincide with Xi's state visit on Friday, Xu said.

Characterizing the documentary as highly significant in bilateral relations, he said it will further enhance people-to-people bonds.

Xu called on the two countries to step up their efforts to strengthen synergies in their development strategies by jointly building the Belt and Road and intensifying pragmatic cooperation in various fields that will push the comprehensive strategic partnership to a higher level.

More than 100 officials from China and Myanmar attended the ceremony, along with media representatives.

The three-episode documentary, which presents Xi's vision of governance, was jointly presented by the China Intercontinental Communication Center and the Discovery Channel from the United States. It uses vivid stories to explain practices and achievements in the governance of China under Xi's leadership and provides deep insights about China's development path. And it shows why China is an inspiration to the world.

The first episode, The People's Republic, features stories about poverty reduction, healthcare reform, construction of high-speed trains and various other fields that relate to people's everyday life.

The second episode, Running China Now, presents case studies on China's supply-side reform, technical innovation and pollution management, among other endeavors the country is undertaking on the domestic front.

The final episode, All Aboard, features China's major global initiatives and undertakings.

The documentary includes interviews with a panel of experts and scholars, including former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd; US scholar Robert Kuhn; British scholar Martin Jacques; Zheng Yongnian, director of the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore; and Zambian economist Dambisa Moyo.

Kyaw Win, chairman of Shwe Than Lwin Media Co, said at the ceremony that he was impressed by China's poverty reduction and its efforts to fight corruption. Myanmar can learn from China's governance experience, as it deals with similar problems, he said.

Kyaw Win also called for media cooperation to promote cultural and people-to-people exchanges.

During media exchanges, representatives of Chinese and Myanmar outlets held a roundtable discussing bilateral cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative on Wednesday.

A book of Xi's remarks on the BRI was introduced at the meeting.
