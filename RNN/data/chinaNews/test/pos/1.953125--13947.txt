Victoria University staff discussed keeping a "low profile" when invited on board a Chinese naval ship during its unannounced visit to New Zealand.

The Qi Jiguang slid quietly into Wellington Harbour between October 26 and 30, with no explanation from the Government or NZ Defence Force (NZDF). The navy training vessel was on a two-month tour of the Asia-Pacific region.

NZDF said at the time it was aware of the visit but referred any questions to the Chinese Embassy.

Emails released under the Official Information Act showed weeks before the ship arrived, the Chinese Embassy contacted Victoria University inviting several senior staff to a deck reception on board the vessel.

Staff and students were also invited for a tour of the ship.

The university's assistant vice-chancellor, Rebecca Needham, forwarded the invite to other staff, saying the ship would be in New Zealand on a "goodwill visit".

Deputy vice-chancellor Blair McRae replied suggesting she take advice from another staff member about touring the ship.

As the US backs away from leadership in the Asia-Pacific, China seems prepared to step forward - this time with a display of naval power in the disputed South China Sea.

"I am not sure how we could communicate this or indeed if we should. I am thinking not," McRae said.

"Again, my instinct is that we keep a low profile but maybe host them here for a visit and tour if they have time?"

Needham agreed it was "better all round to keep this low profile".

In the end, Needham was the only senior staff member who went to the deck reception.

Three staff from the university's NZ Contemporary China Research Centre, including its director, and the deputy director of the university's Confucius Institute (CI) also attended.

CIs embedded in Western universities have been criticised as proxies of influence for the Chinese Communist Party.

Needham, a former director of the university's CI, also arranged a tour of the campus for 80 naval trainees from the ship on October 29.

The first media report about the ship's visit was on October 22 â€“ four days before it turned up in the Wellington Harbour.

Before the ship arrived, Stuff requested documents and correspondence regarding the visit from NZDF.

The request was declined on the grounds it would be likely to prejudice the international relations of New Zealand.

"The visit was organised and approved in the usual way, through diplomatic channels," Air Commodore A.J. Woods, chief of staff at NZ Defence Force, said in a November response to Stuff.

"Personnel from PLAN's Qi Jiguang undertook courtesy calls on the Vice Chief of Defence Force and Chief of Navy, and a number of Defence force personnel attended two functions on-board the ship."

An academic who was present at one of the functions on-board the ship, who did not want to be named, said it was an opportunity to observe the "theatre of shifting power".

He said a NZDF representative delivered "an intelligent and nuanced statement" about New Zealand's position on the ship's visit.
