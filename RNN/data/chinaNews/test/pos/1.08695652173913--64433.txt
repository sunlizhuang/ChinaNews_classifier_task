PARIS, Feb 8 (Reuters) - France's foreign office on Saturday issued new travel advice for its citizens due to the coronavirus outbreak, saying it did not recommend travelling to China unless there was an "imperative" reason to go.

Until now it had formally discouraged travel to Wuhan, where the virus originated from, and recommended travellers to the rest of China be vigilant and consider putting off trips.
