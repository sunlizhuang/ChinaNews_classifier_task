FLUOR has been awarded a contract to provide engineering, procurement and construction for INVISTA’s new adiponitrile plant in Shanghai, China.

The US$1.2bn plant will be located at the Shanghai Chemical Industry Park and will produce 400,000 t/y of adiponitrile, which is used to make nylon.

Mark Fields, Group President of Fluor’s Energy & Chemicals business, said: “We look forward to supporting INVISTA’s efforts to expeditiously increase production of adiponitrile with their company’s most-advanced technology to meet growing demand within China and globally.”

Construction is expected to start this year with production starting in 2022. The new adiponitrile plant will be integrated with INVISTA’s existing 215,000 t/y hexamethylenediamine plant and 150,000 t/y nylon 6,6 polymer plant.
