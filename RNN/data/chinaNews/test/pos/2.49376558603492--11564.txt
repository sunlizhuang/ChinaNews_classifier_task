Mango factory officially inaugurated

Hyundai Mao Legacy Co Ltd on Wednesday held the grand opening of its $10-million mango processing plant in Kampong Speu province’s Phnom Sruoch district, marking a significant milestone for the Kingdom’s agribusinesses and export industry.

In a first for the Kingdom, mango products from the factory exported to South Korea on Wednesday.

Shipments of Cambodian mangoes to that country were recently greenlighted by Korea’s Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency after its experts conducted several inspections of local mango farms.

Presiding over the ceremony, Lieutenant General Hun Manet, deputy commander-in-chief of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces and commander of the army’s infantry, hailed the factory as a vital contribution to the local agriculture industry.

“This factory contributes to promoting the ‘Made in Cambodia’ brand globally,” Manet said.

“It showcases an important partnership between the private sector and the government to promote the development of the agriculture sector, improve the lives of farmers, and enhance the quality of our products,” he said.

Mao Kunpisey, a representative of Hyundai Mao Legacy, said good relations between the Kingdom and South Korea facilitated the investment and helped made the factory a reality.

Hyundai Mao Legacy is a joint venture of South Korea’s giant Hyundai Corporation and local company Mao Legacy. The company was formed in 2016. It grows mangoes on 2,400ha in Kampong Speu province.

Park Heung-Kyeong, South Korean Ambassador to Cambodia, also noted that the plant would not have been built if it weren’t for the good relationship between the countries. He said the investment will build trust in the local market among Korean and Cambodian investors.

“Hyundai Mao Legacy Co Ltd seeks to connect Cambodian agricultural products to foreign markets. Cambodian fresh mango is very popular among Korean consumers, so I believe the plant will contribute to improving the living standards of Cambodians,” he said.

Ngin Chhay, the director-general of the General Directorate of Agriculture at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, pointed out that Cambodia produces four million tonnes of mango every year, boasting 100,000ha dedicated to the crop.

Last year, the Kingdom exported 58,162 tonnes of fresh mango to six markets – Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, France, Russia and Hong Kong.

“As planned, the first shipment of Cambodian mango was carried out today. Next, we will reach an agreement to export mangoes to China as well. It will happen this year,” Chhay said.
