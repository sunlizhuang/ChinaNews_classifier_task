KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia – Organizers of the Export Furniture Exhibition being held here in early March say they have no plans to cancel or reschedule the show despite growing health concerns over the Novel Coronavirus in China.

The Malaysia Furniture Council said the March 9-12 show will go on as planned at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Center in Malaysia. “Malaysia remains a safe travel destination, and EFE is monitoring closely updates from the World Health Organization, the Malaysian Government, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Tourism and Culture on the coronavirus,” the organizer said.

“To ensure all around safety, Malaysian authorities are on high alert and have raised the highest protection measures in accordance with WHO’s guidelines to safeguard travelers’ well-being. As a responsible organizer, EFE Expo is ready to take preventative actions and measures in line with MOH guidelines to ensure all around safety for the participants and travelers to Malaysia and EFE 2020.

Show organizers said they also will provide updates on any new developments between now and the show.

Organizers of the Malaysian International Furniture Fair also said their show will continue as planned. That show takes place March 6-9, also in Kuala Lumpur.

Shows in China including the CIFF Guangzhou show and the Intertextiles show in Shanghai have postponed their March events until further notice.
