HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 04: Christian Bale attends the Premiere Of FOX's "Ford V Ferrari" at TCL Chinese Theatre on November 04, 2019 in Hollywood, California.

The Dark Knight might be teaming up with the God of Thunder. Christian Bale is in talks to join Thor: Love and Thunder, according to Variety. And Twitter already knows which Marvel character they’d like to see Bale play.

On Monday (Jan.6) it was reported that Bale, who previously starred in Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy, was in negotiations to join the MCU. The fourth Thor film, directed by Thor: Ragnarok‘s Taika Waititi, will feature Chris Hemsworth in the titular role, but it will also see the return of Natalie Portman, who plays Dr. Jane Foster, wielding Thor’s hammer Mjölnir.

The new film will be based on the comic book series, Thor: Love and Thunder, which has Jane taking up the role of Mighty Thor. In that series, she fights Cul, who is the God of Fear, and also Thor’s uncle, which might be the perfect role for Bale. There is precedent for someone of Bale’s caliber joining Thor as a bad guy, after all, fellow Oscar winner Cate Blanchett previously played the villain in Thor: Ragnarok.

But fans on Twitter have a Thor fan favorite in mind for Bale, according to ScreenRant, and his name is Beta Ray Bill. The character made his comic debut in 1983 and was originally deemed a villain until he showed could lift Mjölnir. A bust of Beta Ray made its debut in Thor: Ragnarok and his weapon, Stormbreaker, showed up in Avengers: Infinity War. After years of hinting that he could join the MCU, will Bale’s casting mean it’s finally time? Well, we’ll have to wait and see.

Thor: Love and Thunder hits theaters Nov. 5, 2021.
