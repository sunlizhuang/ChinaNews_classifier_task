North Country Congresswoman Elise Stefanik has been named as one of the state chairs of President Donald Trump's election campaign in New York.

In a statement yesterday, Stefanik - a Republican - said she's "honored to be chosen" for the role. She praised Trump's agenda, which she said has focused on "creating jobs, strengthening our military" and securing our borders.

Stefanik was once a frequent critic of Trump but in recent months she has emerged as one of his fiercest defenders in Washington. Her honorary role on Trump's campaign was announced as articles of impeachment against the President were being forwarded to the US Senate.

Stefanik has opposed impeachment from the outset, accusing Democrats of pursuing Trump unfairly. President Trump won the popular vote in the North Country, though he lost by a sizable margin across New York state.
