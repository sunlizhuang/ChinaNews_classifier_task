A steaming hot bowl of chicken and sweetcorn soup washed down with an unfamiliar but surprisingly good pint of Japanese Kirin Ichiban lager ushered in the start of a new decade of taste testing adventures for my husband Hugh and I.

After all the traditional fare of the festive season, we really needed something different to reawaken our somewhat jaded taste buds.

A tasty Chinese meal seemed like the perfect solution, so we were dining at East, one of Llandudno’s most popular Asian restaurants. This has been under the same ownership of Hong Kong born Eric Chan and his wife Connie for nearly fourteen years and is still going strong today, with a large following of locals as well as visitors to the resort.

B&B owners are even recommending it to their guests and some people claim it’s the best Chinese in the area.

Handily located opposite the railway station, East offers a very extensive selection of Cantonese dishes to eat in or take away, with a dash of Japanese and Thai added for good measure.

I love Chinese food - particularly Cantonese or Yue cuisine, which is renowned for its lightly cooked fresh vegetables, meat and fish and sweet sauces.

It originates from the coastal province of Guangdong in south east China around Hong Kong and thanks to its emigrants who opened restaurants in many countries, is the most widely served style of Chinese cooking in the world.

Would East offer the real deal or westernised versions of authentic dishes?

Bigger inside than the rather unassuming frontage suggests, the spacious ground floor restaurant can seat about 60 people at sturdy tables with plenty of space between so you don’t feel cramped. The upstairs party room, which was not open on this occasion, easily holds 30 people.

At the time of our visit although the place was spotlessly clean and bright with a large well stocked bar, the decor was certainly looking a little tired. All this is shortly set to change when a revamp takes place.

The first few weeks of the new year are usually quiet for restaurants, but it certainly wasn’t the case at East!

When we arrived on a gloomy midweek night we found the place busy with a lively mix of families with children, couples, several groups of young people and an Asian family happily tucking into their meals - a good sign, I thought. One couple were even given plastic containers to take home their leftovers.

I had booked in advance and we were quickly shown to a table at the front of the restaurant by Vera, a helpful young server from the Czech Republic and left to study the wine list and seven page menu, which were both pretty impressive by any standard.

On offer were wines from all over the world costing from £13.50 to £23 per bottle, house wines at £3.80 for a 175ml glass, prosecco, champagne including Dom Perignon and Moet & Chandon, beers, soft drinks, spirits and some exotic oriental liquors including Sake from Japan and Mou Tai Chiew, China’s pungent national spirit.

I selected a glass of Volandas Sauvignon Blanc from Chile and Hugh went for Kirin Japanese lager, a brew new to him.

There’s so much on the menu that you really are spoiled for choice. Prices are reasonable and portions are generous.

Customers have the opportunity to try a great variety of individual duck, pork, chicken, beef, seafood, vegetarian, rice and noodle dishes, plus sizzling steak platters, combination appetisers and different set menus ie Cantonese, Japanese, Thai and gourmet. There are also party banquets and a lunch menu.

Everything is freshly cooked to order by head chef Eric and his team so be prepared to wait if the restaurant is busy.

My other half was delighted to find five different oriental soups on the menu, each priced at £4. They included the ever popular chicken and sweetcorn as well as less well known hot and sour, wun-tun, Japanese miso and tom yum kung, Thailand’s most popular soup.

Hugh decided to stick with chicken and sweetcorn, an old favourite, which arrived exactly as he liked it –hot, thick and tasty with plentiful pieces of chicken. A satisfying and flavoursome dish, with just the right amount of salt.

Continuing with the chicken theme, he chose traditional Thai style green chicken curry as his main course and was equally satisfied with this classic dish.

Aromatic, deliciously fragrant with masses of chicken breast and different herbs, it packed just the right amount of punch and like all the 17 chicken dishes on the menu, cost a very reasonable £8.

I decided to try seafood and after much deliberation settled for a sizzling stir fried mix of scallops, king prawns and squid with ginger and spring onion.

In just a few minutes this arrived with a dish of egg fried rice to share. Everything was perfectly cooked and well presented but personally speaking I found the sauce too bland and the majority of the seafood was squid. A few more king prawns would have gone down well!

In the interests of the taste test we decided to finish our meal by sharing a Chinese pineapple fritter rather than going for sticky toffee pudding, chocolate fudge cake or deep fried ice cream, which were the other desserts available.

Very nice it was too, with a fresh not tinned slice of pineapple at its heart, a crispy batter coating and lots of sweet sticky sauce.

There is much to like about East – the atmosphere is warm and welcoming, the staff are attentive and the menu offers a great choice of authentic Asian dishes at prices that won’t break the bank.

Does it get the seal of approval? Most certainly.
