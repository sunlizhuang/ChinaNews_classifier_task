— President Donald Trump will sign his signature trade deal with Mexico and Canada at a White House ceremony today, but noticeably absent will be the Democrats who played a big role in securing votes for the USMCA.

— U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer could finalize a limited trade deal with India when he travels to the country next month. The deal would largely focus on granting more access for U.S. medical devices, agricultural products and strengthening intellectual property protections.

— The Trump administration’s long-anticipated Middle East peace plan calls for the U.S. to reach a free trade agreement with an independent Palestinian state and hopes other countries would follow suit.

IT’S WEDNESDAY, JAN. 29! Welcome to Morning Trade, where your host is heading to Detroit later today for more USMCA coverage (after the White House ceremony, of course). Anything I should be looking out for? Trade news to share? Let me know: srodriguez@politico.com or @sabrod123.

Driving the Day

IT’S USMCA SIGNING DAY: Trump will sign the USMCA at a White House ceremony today, marking a rare bipartisan achievement at a largely partisan celebration. Republican lawmakers, local officials and business, industry and union leaders will join Trump for the occasion, while Democrats have not been invited despite their work to secure the final pact.

The event comes 425 days after he signed the original version of the USMCA with Mexico and Canada in November 2018.

Victory lap continues: Trump will continue the celebration in Warren, Mich., on Thursday, with an event at Dana Inc., an auto parts supplier, to tout the benefits of the pact.

Reminder: The USMCA will not take effect with Trump’s signature. Canada must still ratify the pact, and all three countries must work to check off all requirements outlined in the deal before it can take effect. That could take months and lots of behind-the-scenes talks within and between each country.

A senior Democratic aide noted one possible holdup: Mexico and Canada don’t necessarily have an incentive to rush to implement the USMCA since they will continue to enjoy NAFTA benefits in the meantime.

“Usually, the motivation is that, the other country, they have nothing and they’re going to get something. But here, they already have all the tariff-free benefits, and now they’re going to get a slightly different something,” the aide told Morning Trade.

U.S. AND INDIA LOOK FOR FEBRUARY TRADE DEAL: Lighthizer is expected to travel to New Delhi in early February to finalize a limited trade deal with India. The trip would lay the groundwork for Trump to visit India in late February, according to three people familiar with the planning.

A source familiar with the planning said a meeting between Lighthizer and Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal would take place Feb. 10 in New Delhi. That would follow a New Delhi visit by a group of U.S. trade officials last week and over the weekend.

What’s in a deal: Trump has dubbed India the “tariff king,” taking aim at the country’s high tariff rates on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are expected to see a tariff reduction as part of a deal. Trade issues that have been discussed for months will likely be part of the package, including getting rid of price caps for U.S.-built medical devices and granting more market access for U.S. dairy products, cherries, pork, hay and distillers dried grains. The deal could also include provisions to strengthen intellectual property protections.

India is looking for full restoration of its participation in the Generalized System of Preferences. However, a trade deal is unlikely to address India's move last year to raise tariffs on a range of telecommunications and technology products, mainly as an effort to guard against imports of cheaper Chinese goods, the people said.

BRITISH INDUSTRY: TAKE TIME TO GET U.S. TRADE DEAL RIGHT: Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson should take as much time as they need to reach a free trade agreement that creates substantial new business opportunities on both sides of the Atlantic, a British industry official said Tuesday.

"We want to be sure when we do get a deal, we get the right deal," John Dickerman, head of the Washington office for the Confederation of British Industry, said at an event hosted by the Global Business Dialogue, an industry-supported forum to discuss trade issues.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week that the Trump administration wanted to wrap up talks with the U.K. on a free trade agreement by the end of the year. That's an ambitious timeline unless the two sides decide to push for just a partial agreement, which is the approach the Trump administration took with Japan and China in recent months.

Johnson speech to Congress? The two sides could formally begin talks in February, when Johnson is widely expected to visit Washington and perhaps give a speech to a joint session of Congress, Nile Gardiner, a British policy expert at The Heritage Foundation, said at the same event.

Morning Trade reached out to the offices of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to see if there were any plans for Johnson to address a joint session. Neither office confirmed an invitation.

U.K. AMBASSADOR WATCH: It’s been more than six months since British Ambassador to the United States Kim Darroch announced his resignation, after the leak of official documents in which he characterized the Trump administration as “dysfunctional” and “inept.”

With the start of U.S.-U.K. trade talks on the horizon, Global Business Dialogue President R.K. “Judge” Morris argued at the event he hosted on Tuesday that it makes sense for the U.K. to fill the spot with a strong individual to help make the case for the pact.

Gardiner agreed and recommended that Johnson choose “more of a political appointee,” rather than another civil servant like Darroch.

Earlier this month, POLITICO’s London Playbook reported that Darroch’s successor was expected to be announced within weeks. It pegged Karen Pierce, the U.K.’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, as “very much the woman to beat.” Other contenders reportedly include Matthew Rycroft, permanent secretary at the department for international development, and Antonia Romeo, permanent secretary at the department for international trade.

TRUMP’S MIDEAST PEACE PLAN INCLUDES A U.S.-PALESTINE FTA: The Trump administration’s Middle East peace plan envisions a free trade agreement with an independent Palestinian state and “hopes that countries in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere will also pursue free trade agreements with the State of Palestine.”

“The State of Israel and the Arab countries, including the State of Palestine, should establish strong economic partnerships and trade agreements,” the plan says. “There should be a particular focus on significantly improving the economic and tourism sectors of the State of Palestine, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the Arab Republic of Egypt.”

The plan would set up a free trade zone between Jordan and Palestine. It would also give a Palestinian state the rights to use port facilities at the Haifa and Ashdod ports that are located in Israeli territory. Palestine would also have access to the Jordanian port of Aqaba on the Red Sea.

KENYAN PRESIDENT’S VISIT FUELS TRADE TALK EXPECTATIONS: Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta’s visit to Washington next week is fueling expectations the two countries will agree to launch trade negotiations, as POLITICO reported was possible.

A source familiar with the upcoming visit said Kenyatta is expected to spell out his hopes for a trade deal when he speaks at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Feb. 6.

However, neither the White House nor USTR confirmed a Bloomberg report on Tuesday of a possible announcement on trade talks. The White House also would not say whether Trump would meet with Kenyatta.

Lighthizer two years ago expressed hope of negotiating a free trade agreement with an African country that could be used as a model for the rest of the region. A deal would also help lock in Kenya's current duty-free access to the U.S. market after 2025, when the African Growth and Opportunity Act is set to expire.

South Africa’s trade benefits on the block: USTR will hold a hearing on Thursday that could lead to removal of trade benefits for South Africa under both AGOA and the Generalized System of Preferences.
