Cold storage warehouses in Tianjin and Shanghai -- two of the world's busiest ports -- are "full", according to the Maritime Bureau of China's Ministry of Transport, and shipping companies are advised to send goods to alternative locations.

According to a Feb 12 announcement, shipping companies docking at Shanghai port may face congestion fees or be re-routed to other ports in China.

"Cold storage capacity at Shanghai port is currently full," said the notice, which was shared with Undercurrent News by an industry source in China. "Valued customers abroad who have not yet sent goods, for the time being, do not send goods to Shanghai port."

A separate announcement said cold storage in Tianjin port is also full.

Shipping companies are advised to send containers to ports in Shekou, Ningbo, Taican or elsewhere. The advice is "effective until, tentatively, Feb. 28", said the first announcement.

According to World Shipping, Shanghai port is the world's busiest port while Tianjin is the world's ninth-busiest.

Goods approved for customs and inspection at Shanghai port may have trouble gaining smooth entry at other ports, the notice concedes, due to customs clearance regulations; bananas re-routed from Shanghai "may not be able to clear customs and inspection, which could lead to unavoidable damage and losses," it said.

Cold storage is stretched because drivers for haulage companies face difficulties returning to work, according to a seafood industry source with a processor in Qingdao, causing a logjam.

"[There's] no trucking service now," the source, who did not wish to be named, told Undercurrent on Friday (Feb. 14). "I believe for other ports it's the same."

Ningbo-Zhoushan port, which is a four-hour drive from Shanghai, and which is suggested as an alternative port of entry in the notice, is the world's fourth-busiest port.

However, Undercurrent understands this port is primarily for bulk commodities, although Zhoushan also has a large seafood processing hub. (To view a photo gallery of the hub from a recent visit by Undercurrent, click here.)

Other nearby port options include Hengsha International Fishing Port in Shanghai, which has 50,000 metric tons of cold storage capacity dedicated for imported frozen meat and seafood, as well as docking facilities for small- and medium-sized vessels.

Meanwhile, the North China International Seafood Trading Center near Qingdao, Shandong province, which claims to be one of China's largest seafood industry developments, opened 150,000t of cold storage capacity last year, including the worldâ€™s largest super-low-temperature cold storage warehouse.

The center is operating "as normal", a spokesperson for the firm behind the project told Undercurrent on Friday.

Shirmp imports appear most at risk

In the seafood sector, the logjam at Shanghai and Tianjin could hit China's importers of shrimp most; according to China's Aquatic Products Processing and Marketing Alliance (CAPPMA), in 2018, Tianjin handled 43,000t of shrimp imports, while Shanghai took 23,000t.

This made Tianjin port China's biggest port of entry for frozen shrimp and Shanghai the fourth-largest.

According to Cui He, president of CAPPMA, in south China, consumers tend to prefer live shrimp, which are farmed locally, whereas in north China they rely more on frozen imports.

Other main ports of entry for frozen shrimp in China are Guangdong (2nd, 2018 figures), Liaoning (3rd), Shandong (5th) and Fujian (6th), according to CAPPMA.

In 2019, China's imports of shrimp almost tripled to 718,000t, seeing it overhaul the US to become the world's largest importer by volume, according to Chinese customs data compiled by Undercurrent News. The value of full-year imports came to $4.44 billion.

On Thursday (Feb. 13), Peru announced it has stopped exports to China of fish for human consumption, according to the country's committee of fisheries and aquaculture of the national society of industries, due to the logjam at Chinese ports.

Meanwhile, on Wednesday, tilapia processors in the country's south told Undercurrent they still have not reopened because of coronavirus.
