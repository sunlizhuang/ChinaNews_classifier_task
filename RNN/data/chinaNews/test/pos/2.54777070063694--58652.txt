The goods have been distributed to six hospitals in the city to support their normal operations, according to Sichuan Online, a local news portal.

The goods, a token of love and care from Sichuan, traveled 1,300 kilometers via Chongqing, which connects Sichuan and Hubei provinces. They were loaded onto six trucks, each driven by two experienced long-distance truck drivers who are also farmers.

The vegetables were purchased by Wenchuan farmers with their own money. Zhao Yong, who was in charge of the delivery, said his village raised more than 100,000 yuan and all the money was used to buy vegetables.

A representative of a hospital in Wuhan expressed gratitude to people in Wenchuan, saying the goods reflected their goodwill and determination to help Wuhan get through its difficulties, and such assistance and care will never be forgotten.

Li Jiang, one of the villagers who helped distribute the vegetables upon their arrival, said like Wuhan, Wenchuan had encountered difficulties, and believes that the city will pull through with help from the rest of the country.
