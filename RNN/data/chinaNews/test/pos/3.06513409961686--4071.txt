Prince Harry and Meghan Markle may have come up with a way to make “Megxit” pay — by trademarking their “Sussex Royal” brand for more than 100 items last summer, official records show.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex insisted in Wednesday’s shocking announcement that they would “become financially independent” once free of their royal responsibilities.

Records with the UK’s Intellectual Property Office show that last June the couple made moves to prep a possible financial empire.

Under both “Sussex Royal” and their charitable organization, “The Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex,” the couple secured trademarks with a wide cross-section of possible products.

Included are clothing, stationery, photographs, educational and charitable endeavors — and even possibly their own newspaper or magazine.

“Undoubtedly, this will be a multimillion-pound revenue business,” retail expert Andy Barr told the Daily Mail, predicting it could generate revenues of more than $500 million.

“This will just be the steppingstone for higher-value products being launched later down the line.

“As the brand, they are building will automatically have global appeal, their revenue will grow even further.”

PR expert Mark Borkowski told the paper that the Sussexes could prove to have a “very powerful foundation or brand” that could prove “dangerous” to the royal family’s own brand.

“I think around the world — China, America, Southeast Asia, India, parts of Europe — people will be falling over to get brand connections with them,” he told the Mail. “They will make a fortune.”
