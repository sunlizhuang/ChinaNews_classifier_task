The Ip Man martial arts film series might have ended, but Donnie Yen is still on a roll.

The Hong Kong star and film producer recently announced his intention to donate US$128,393 (HK 1 million) to the current battle against COVID-19.

His donation will be dedicated to the frontline medical staff in Wuhan, though there is no report explaining the specific details.

Since the finale of the Ip Man franchise, Yen has remained active within the film industry, releasing the buddy-cop comedy-action film Enter the Fat Dragon at the beginning of 2020. Both films have received positive reviews.

But Yen had a more serious note to share to his followers on the Chinese website Weibo.

“Hello everyone, I am Yen Ji-dan. I want to take this opportunity to thank all the medical frontline workers," Yen said in the 28-second video.

"In this critical moment, everyone please protect yourself well by wearing a mask and wash your hands more often. Distance yourself from the virus but don’t distance love. I believe our country (China) will win the battle against the virus and have the situation under control."

Yen ended his speech with a cheer, "Wuhan jia yo, China jia yo.”

'Jia yo' is a Mandarin phrase expressing encouragement.

Yen is well known for his philanthropic work, with the online social innovation and charity platform Go.Asia, co-founded with his wife Cissy Wang, and his ambassador roles with international charities.
