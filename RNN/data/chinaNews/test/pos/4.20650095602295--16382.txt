Botou Dongfang Fruit Co., Ltd. in Cangzhou, Hebei, organized a festive ceremony on January 14th to celebrate the first export of fresh Chinese pears to Brazil. The festive ceremony marked the official start of fresh Chinese pear export to Brazil. Mr. Guo Zhongtao of Botou Dongfang Fruit recently talked about Chinese pear export.

"The Brazilian market has strict standards for orchard management and fruit processing facilities of Chinese companies that export pears to Brazil. Our first export to Brazil consists of two shipping containers of fruit. The fruit varieties in this shipment include the Xingao, Imperial Crown, Ya, and Fengshui pear varieties. We expect this shipment to arrive in Brazil in early March."

"Brazil is the second-largest importer of pears in the world, but previously the country mainly imported fresh pears from Chile and Peru. The consumers in Brazil have virtually no knowledge of Chinese pears. The pears from China have many unique characteristics. We hope that we can supply every kitchen in Brazil with Chinese pears that look good, are healthy and safe to eat, and have a delicious flavor," said manager Guo.

"We believe that Chinese pears will be able to obtain a permanent position in the Brazilian fruit market. However, we are still in the early stages, and it is too early to predict the exact share of Chinese pears in the Brazilian market. We need consumer feedback on this first shipment of Chinese pears before we can further explore the Brazilian market."

"Currently, our most important overseas markets include North America, Australia, Israel, Mexico, and Indonesia. The Russian market recently closed its borders for Chinese pears. This decision had a major impact on our export volume. However, export conditions in other overseas markets remain stable and so does our export volume in those markets. We hope the growing market in Brazil will compensate for losing access to the Russian market," said manager Guo.

Botou Dongfang Fruit will participate in the Berlin Fruit Logistica on February 5-7. "Visitors are welcome at our stand in hall 26 at booth D-04J. This is the fourth year in a row that we participate in Fruit Logistica. We have booked great results every time we participate. In addition to catching up with old clients, we also hope to meet many potential business partners from Brazil. We hope to lay the foundation for further expansion in the Brazilian market."

Botou Dongfang Fruit established a model orchard to showcase their premium fresh pears. The model orchard for fresh pears covers an area of 107 hectares. The overall orchard covers an area of 6,400 hectares. "In order to guarantee product quality, we distribute pesticide, fertilizer, and protective pouches for the pears to all the farmers we cooperate with. We also provide the farmers with standardized, large-scale systems for the green production of pears. In addition to pears, we also export winter jujubes and apples. As our company develops and we open up new markets, we will be able to provide a wider range of fresh fruits and vegetables to more overseas customers."
