On 21 February local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith of Laos in Vientiane.

Thongloun Sisoulith asked Wang Yi to convey his warm greetings to Chinese leaders. He was happy about his successful visit to China last month during which he had productive meetings with Chinese leaders and traveled to places outside Beijing to learn China’s experience of poverty alleviation. Laos stands ready to work with China to sustain the strong growth momentum of bilateral ties.

He noted the significance of Wang’s visit to Laos at a crucial moment in China’s fight against the epidemic. The successful Special ASEAN-China Foreign Ministers’ Meeting on Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) Foreign Ministers’ Meeting held the day before demonstrated the resolve of ASEAN and China to jointly tide over the current difficulties. It was Laos’ pleasure to host the two meetings. Laos highly appreciates the tremendous efforts China has made to combat the outbreak. Over the years, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has grown from strength to strength in the course of overcoming numerous challenges. He firmly believes that under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, with the strenuous efforts of the Chinese people and international cooperation, China will win an early victory over the epidemic, sustain rapid economic growth and realize its first centenary goal as scheduled. He also expressed confidence that China will emerge stronger from this epidemic and become a more important pillar for world peace, stability and development. Laos will always stand side by side with China and stands ready to provide assistance for China’s epidemic response to the best of its capabilities. Laos is collecting donations within the country. Though limited in amount, these donations represent the goodwill of the Lao people toward their Chinese brothers. He had told the Lao nationals in China to keep full confidence in the Chinese government. At this special moment, it is more important than ever to work with the Chinese comrades in confronting the difficulties. He thanked the Chinese government for taking care of them, adding that they are doing well in China and are in good health.

Wang passed on the greetings from Chinese leaders to Thongloun Sisoulith. He noted that the Prime Minister’s successful visit to China last month further enhanced the mutual trust between the two Parties and between the leaders of the two countries. The visit also produced important agreement between the two sides on implementing the action plan for building a China-Laos community with a shared future. Linked by mountains and rivers, China and Laos share a common future and enjoy a bond as close as that between lips and teeth. After the epidemic broke out, Laos immediately expressed its confidence and support to China and kindly hosted the two meetings. The concrete actions of Laos speak volumes about the unbreakable brotherhood between the two countries and the essence of the China-Laos community with a shared future. The Special Foreign Ministers’ Meeting yesterday, the first multilateral meeting focusing on the epidemic, was timely, successful and of great significance. As the 11 foreign ministers joined hands and cheered for Wuhan and China, they demonstrated the brotherly sentiments of China’s neighbors and lent strong positive energy in support of China’s fight against the epidemic, capturing wide attention of the international community. China and ASEAN have the fine tradition of helping each other in times of adversity. Wang expressed confidence that the meeting will further boost unity and cooperation between China and ASEAN member states, and improve the region’s capacity to jointly address public health emergencies.

Wang briefed on the latest progress in China’s fight against the outbreak. He said that under the personal direction of President Xi Jinping, the Chinese people are united as one and making nationwide efforts in an all-out people’s war on the virus. China has grown and thrived through various challenges and difficulties. No difficulty can daunt China, still less defeat us. With the strong leadership of General Secretary Xi Jinping, with the 90 million CPC members setting a fine example on the frontline of the battle, with unprecedented economic strength at its disposal, and with the enormous advantage of the socialist system, China not only has the capacity and confidence to win a full victory against the epidemic at an early date but also the determination to meet its economic and social development targets as expected by its people and the world at large. After the outbreak, the Chinese nation will surely become more resilient and united and its economy stronger and more sustainable, and the strengths of the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics will win greater recognition in the international community. Wang said that Lao citizens choosing to stay in China is a vote of confidence in China. The Lao side can rest assured that China will take good care of Lao brothers and sisters in China the same way it treats its own citizens.
