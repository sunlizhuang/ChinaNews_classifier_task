Over the years since their debut in 2015, the 13-member K-pop group Seventeen or SVT has grown up right before fans' eyes. They've released seven EPs, three full-length studio albums and are starting a world tour in March. Not only does the group as a whole draw you in with its smooth yet upbeat sound, they create a connection with their audience. Each member has a charisma that helps them stand out. Each performance and interview is like a constant reminder that the group just wouldn't be the same without all of them. Here are some more reasons we love them, and not just because they share our name.

Seventeen consists of three sub units

The group as a whole is made up of 13 members (not 17) and they are broken up into three sub units so that each member has an area of expertise. Each sub unit has a leader.

The name Seventeen has two meanings

It's the average age of all the members of the group when they first got together and it's the sum of all the group's parts.

One group + 13 members + three sub groups = Seventeen

Their debut EP 17 Carat charted on Billboard for almost three months

It was there for 11 weeks and became the longest running album on the Billboard World Albums chart in 2015.

Two of the members are Chinese and two are American

Jun is from Shenzhen and The8 is from Liaoning, China. Vernon was born in New York and Joshua is from LA. The rest are South Korean.

The8 was a mentor on a reality competition show

The8 mentored on the second season of Idol Producer, a Chinese reality competition where contests from around the world compete to become the next pop group. The8 was a dance mentor on the show.

Fans think Vernon looks like Leonardo DiCaprio

Tons of Seventeen fans think Vernon looks like Leonardo did when they were the same age. They have even started calling him "Vercaprio." On an episode of the Korean show Happy Together, Vernon said, “If you say I resemble him, it feels good but I feel embarrassed.” What do you think?

Carat is the official name of their fan cub

The name was picked through fan votes and was announced on Valentine's Day, 2016. Their fans are the carats that help Seventeen shine. In a video with Vanity Fair, Vernon said, "Back to 2015, before our debut, we performed this song called 'Shining Diamonds.' The fan name 'carat' started off from that song... So our fans are diamonds, carats."

The fan club even has official colors

Rose Quartz and Serenity are the club's official colors but they were also Pantone's colors of the year in 2016.

And they have an official lightstick

Lightsticks have become synonymous with being a true K-pop fan. Every devoted fan has a lightstick for their fav group. Seventeen's lightstick is called a "carat bong" that features its official colors. It lights up but you change those colors through an app.

They are involved in writing and producing a lot of their music

An article by MTV says that Woozi "crafted much of the group's sound since their debut." Woozi said that making the music themselves "feels more profound."

Woozi told Refinery 29, "At the end of the day, regardless of what is going on, our music is what we sing and what we show our audience. So I believe the music has to be sincere, and reveal our genuine nature. So every album of ours holds the messages and stories that we want to tell the most. And I think that is why Carats like our music."

Seventeen's biggest influences are their parents

In that same interview, Mingyu told Refinery 29, "In the end, whenever I think about the biggest influence in our lives, I go back to our parents. Our parents made it possible for us to meet and come together as Seventeen. They're the people who are closest to us, and have directly impacted our minds and thoughts.”

Seungkwan, Hoshi and DK make up the group BooSeokSoon

BBS can be considered their own sub unit within Seventeen that makes and records music separately from the rest of the group. They debuted in 2018 and released one EP so far called Just Do It. According to Billboard, the name is a reference to all the member's names and in an interview with Billboard, Joshua explained why the units are so effective. "Through our units we’re able to show off different styles of music that we weren’t able to show as a group as a whole, so that’s why I think units are really, really important to our group."
