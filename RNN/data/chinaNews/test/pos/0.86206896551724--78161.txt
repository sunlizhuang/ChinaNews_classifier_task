Coronavirus to Hit Apple Sales: Invest in Domestic Producers

Apple Inc. recently warned its investors of the impact of the deadly coronavirus outbreak on its business. Notably, the iPhone maker has been affected more than previously anticipated as the number of iPhones it can manufacture and sell in China will be limited. The iPhone maker announced that it is trimming sales expectations for this quarter. After all, demand for its products has declined in China, thanks to the outbreak.

Apple has closed all 42 of its stores in the country last month and many are yet to reopen. Management added that “we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated. As a result, we do not expect to meet the revenue guidance we provided for the March quarter.”

Needless to say, that the iPhone maker is heavily dependent on Chinese factories and consumers. Apple CEO, Tim Cook has been working with several Chinese telecom providers in introducing the iPhone in the country over the last 10 years. Following these committed initiatives, iPhone sales did take off, and now China is Apple’s second largest market after the United States.

By the way, Apple also assembles products in China. For instance, a Taiwanese company named Foxconn makes iPhones and other gadgets on behalf of Apple. However, concerns regarding the impact of coronavirus impact on the global economy and subsequently on corporate profits have been on the rise. The deadly virus has now infected over 72,000 people and claimed 1,800 lives, according to official reports. What’s more, nearly three-quarters of a billion people are already locked down in China, per a New York Times analysis.

Further, with the crisis deepening, not just Apple but a host of big companies have indicated that productions may be hurt, which in turn will have a bearing on their financial results. While Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has recently shut down several factory outlets in China, European aerospace giant Airbus, General Motors and Toyota have begun to limit production in China.

Starbucks and Ikea have shut down many stores, while deserted shopping malls in China are expected to adversely impact sales for retailers including Nike and others. Travel related stocks have been hit hard too. Notably, Lufthansa and British Airways have cancelled flights to China. To top it, after a recent breathtaking run, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is looking vulnerable following the coronavirus outbreak. The electronic car maker did acknowledge risks that the coronavirus threat poses to output and overall business.
