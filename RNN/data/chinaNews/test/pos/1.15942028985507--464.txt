Bytedance’s short video app Douyin has surpassed 400 million daily active users (DAU), according to its 2019 annual report released on Sunday.

Why it matters: Douyin has been facing fierce competition from rival short video platform Kuaishou, which entered “battle mode” in June in an effort to boost its DAU to 300 million by the end of January.

The number of overlapping users on Douyin and Kuaishou in June 2019 more than doubled year on year to 158.8 million, according to a report from research firm Quest Mobile.

Details: Douyin’s DAU surged more than 25% from the 320 million figure announced in July, according to the release.

The annual report also highlighted Douyin’s original music push amid Bytedance’s stalemate with major global music labels, which have been seeking higher royalties. The top nine out of the 10 most frequently used songs on Douyin in 2019 were created by independent Chinese musicians.

The report also includes statistics about educational content on Douyin. Content creators made close to 14.9 million educational short videos last year, each reaching an average of 100,000 users.

Context: Despite being locked in an intense rivalry with Tencent-backed Kuaishou, Bytedance has managed to maintain solid user base growth.
