It wasn't even two years ago. Masses of people flooded to London and Windsor to take in the excitement of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding.

The streets were lined with souvenirs but the official line approved by the royals could be purchased through the Royal Collection Trust.

Fast forward to today and in the wake of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepping down from being members of the royal family, the Royal Collection has stopped selling the keepsakes and can't be found on the website.

According to the trust, "many of Royal Collection Trust’s china ranges are produced to celebrate a specific occasion and are sold for a limited time.”

“The china range to celebrate the wedding of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex has sold out," a spokesperson told the Evening Standard.

However, Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank wedding souvenirs from the same year are also sold out but can still be viewed on the site.

Harry and Meghan announced at the start of the year that they would be picking a private life over one in the royal family as they raise their son Archie. The couple has chosen Canada as their base and is expected to announce their own foundation in the spring to coincide with the finalization of their royal duties.
