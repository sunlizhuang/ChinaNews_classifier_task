Hamilton-born mathematician Louis Nirenberg, who made significant contributions to the field of partial differential equations and won an Abel prize (the math equivalent of the Nobel), has died.

Nirenberg died in New York City on Jan. 26, 2020 at the age of 94.

Nirenberg studied mathematics and physics at McGill University and graduated in 1945 before pursuing a masters in math at New York University (NYU), where he would later complete a PhD, hold a postdoctoral position, and become a professor of mathematics. He taught at NYU from 1951 until his retirement in 1999.

An announcement of his death from NYU remembers him as having "exquisite taste in problems" and a keen ability to identify the need for new tools or estimates.

Nirenberg, NYU says, was a lively scholar with a passion for the arts, travelling, and working with others, which is reflected in his papers that were almost all coauthored.



Stan Alama, a McMaster University mathematics and statistics professor, has worked with several of Nirenberg's former students and co-authors. He also took his course in partial differential equations as a student at NYU.



Alama said that Nirenberg's ideas "transformed the way partial differential equations (PDE) were studied."

In an email to CBC News, Alama fondly described what he called an "elegant" 1979 paper on the symmetry of solutions by Nirenberg, Basilis Gidas and Wei Ming Ni. I

It's been cited by others nearly 3,000 times said Alama, which is not a small feat.



"This indicates how the simple idea presented in the paper could be adapted and extended to solve many other problems," he said.

"He found an entirely novel approach which reveled a simple but fundamental truth, thereby introducing a new way of approaching other, similar problems in PDE and beyond."

Professor Lia Bronsard, also with McMaster University, said that Nirenberg's work in PDE was "extraordinary and transformative, but he had a wonderful talent of expressing even the most difficult concepts in natural terms."

McMaster University presented Nirenberg with an honorary degree in 2000, as did other universities including McGill University (1986), University of Pisa (1990), Universit√© de Paris IX Paris-Dauphine (1990), and University of British Columbia (2010).

He was named an honorary professor by Nankai University (1987), Zhejiang University (1988), and Peking University (2016).

His impressive list of awards includes:
