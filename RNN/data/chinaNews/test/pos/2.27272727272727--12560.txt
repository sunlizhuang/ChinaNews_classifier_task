Nine Chinese poets arrived in Colombo, Sri Lanka on Jan. 4 for an exchange activity, which saw them visiting the country’s world cultural heritage sites. On Jan. 9, they attended a seminar in Calcutta, India, and exchanged views with their Indian counterparts.

The activity, named “Long March of Chinese Poetry”, was launched in 2013. It has been held in more than 10 countries including South Africa, the UK, France, Romania, Fiji, Vietnam, Laos, and Zimbabwe.

As a cultural exchange activity under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, the activity is expected to be held in 100 countries to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between poets of different countries.
