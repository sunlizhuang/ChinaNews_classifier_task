Final Frontier and Taiko Studios produced Airbnb China’s Chinese New Year film, a touching animation demonstrating how the brand’s properties can become homes away from home at a time of year where young Chinese are finding it increasingly difficult to return to their family hometowns.

Spring Festival is the most important date on the calendar in China, when families separated by work and life necessities reunite, traditionally in the town where the children grew up.

Titled “Fu”, the three-and-a-half minute 3D animation tells the story of Jia Jia, a young nurse whose pursuit of her career dreams in the big city prevent her from returning to her hometown for Chinese New year, much to the disappointment of herself and her parents. Fortunately, Airbnb’s platform is on-hand to enable a unique solution.

At the core of the film is the age old Chinese New year tradition of hanging a ‘Fú’ (meaning ‘blessing’) banner upside down, symbolizing "good luck comes", tying in to the overall campaign idea of turning traditional concepts on their head; in this case, 'home' coming to Jia Jia rather than the other way around.
