Volunteers with the Purse Project fill new and gently used purses with personal care items for women in need.

Women at Deliverance House in Canton were filled with a mix of emotions after receiving purses filled with personal care items.

Some were shocked a group of volunteers took the time to assemble the purse kits for them. Others cried because they were touched as they read a handwritten note of encouragement slipped inside the bag.

The United Way of Greater Stark County collected hygiene products between January and March last year to place into new and gently used purses.

The purses were then filled and distributed across Stark County agencies that provide support for women in need.

Mayor Kathy Catazaro-Perry was unable to attend the Canton volunteer opportunity last March but loved the idea. After learning more about it, she reached out to United Way to bring the project into western Stark County communities.

"I just love the concept of women helping women," Catazaro-Perry said. "I wanted our Massillon women to be able to give back as well."

Giving back

The Massillon event will be held in the Massillon Museum’s Gessner Hall on Feb. 12. Volunteers are asked to bring a medium to large new or gently used purse with them.

The project is a joint effort between the Greater Stark County United Way and the Massillon mayor’s office.

Volunteers are asked to register for the event ahead of time with 19 slots of 150 still available as of Monday morning.

Refreshments and a cash bar will be available, and the museum will allow attendees to tour its galleries during the event.

Laura Prengaman, director of corporate and volunteer engagement with United Way, said the kits will be supplied to women struggling with homelessness, domestic violence and substance abuse.

Each of the purses will be filled with items such as lip balms, socks, a toothbrush and toothpaste, deodorant, body wash and feminine hygiene products.

Goodwill Industries of Greater Cleveland and East Central Ohio donated 100 purses for the project.

A collection box has been set up at the Massillon Public Library, 208 Lincoln Way E, for anyone wanting to donate items to be used in the kits.

The idea of the Purse Project came about after a staff member at United Way saw a post on Facebook.

The post was about a woman who kept purses filled with toiletries in her car to pass out to women she thought might be in need, Prengaman said. The purse project was inspired by the post, she added.

The Canton Purse Project was one of Prengaman’s first projects as the new corporate and volunteer engagement director.

The nonprofit organization hoped for 300 purses, Prengaman said, adding they were shocked when donations began pouring in. After all the purses were filled, 1,200 purse kits were distributed.

"We had such a huge turnout from the community as far as support," Prengaman said. "... We just had such as huge response via Facebook where we had information about the project and also with the donations coming in. Everyone wanted to help in any way possible."

Lifting women

The volunteers will write a note of encouragement to place inside each of the purses among the other items.

This idea resonated with Catazaro-Perry, who has worked to encourage kindness in the Massillon community through her #Allin4Kindness campaign.

"We're trying to lift up other women in a small way," Catazaro-Perry said. "It's nothing major, but it’s a small way we're able to give back and impact another woman's life."

It always is a good feeling to get a new purse, Prenganam said, explaining the project will allow the women to have something to put their belongings in as well.

However, she said, it’s the handwritten message that will mean the most to many of the women.

"(It’s knowing) a stranger thought of you," Prenganam said. "The note inside is probably the most meaningful because you’re actually getting to hear about this person who doesn’t know you but cares about you and cares about your well being."

Deliverance House is one of many locations where the purses were dropped off. Michelle Smith, house manager, said they received nearly 40 purses.

Deliverance House provides assistance to women struggling with substance abuse and mental health issues.

"I think it’s a wonderful thing that they do for people in the community," Smith said. "(These women) just think that nobody cares so with something like this ... It really impacted the ladies we serve here."

Catazaro-Perry said she hopes the event leads to more opportunities to provide support to women in need in Stark County.

"There are women that want to help other women, but they can't donate," she said. "This is a way they can participate and really uplift women. I’m really excited, and I’m looking forward to the event."
