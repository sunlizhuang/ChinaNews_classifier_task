BELGRADE (Serbia), January 31 (SeeNews) - Serbia is in talks with the Chinese government for the launch of a hub for agricultural exports from the region to the Asian country, Serbia's agriculture minister Branislav Nedimovic has said.

"We are in talks with China on establishing a hub, a place from where Serbian agricultural products and products of neighbouring countries can be shipped to China," Nedimovic said in a video file posted on the website of news agency Tanjug on Thursday.

Serbia currently exports beef, lamb and wine to China but we are working to expand this list, Nedimovic said, speaking on the sidelines of the Agro Belgrade 2020 international fruit, viticulture and vegetable fair.

Serbia resumed exports of beef to China after a 30-year pause in September 2018 after inspections in China proved that Serbian beef meets all regulatory requirements of the Asian country.
