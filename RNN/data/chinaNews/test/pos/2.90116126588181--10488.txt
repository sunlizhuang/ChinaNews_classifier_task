“These internships allow students to explore careers and increase their marketability after graduation,” said Tena Pair, Rowan-Cabarrus Work-Based Learning internship developer, who worked to locate the internship and secure accessibility services for Bovard. “Students like Hope can increase their self-confidence and develop skills that build their resume, and some are even hired permanently by the companies where they intern. Hope is a great example of the success that students can achieve in internships, and she is beyond deserving of this honor.”
