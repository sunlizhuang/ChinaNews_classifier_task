It's not the biggest surprise to hear another iteration of it's fitness tracker. When the Mi Band 4 went on sale back in June 2019, it sold one million devices in just eight days.

But after the Mi Band 4 introduced the a color touchscreen display and swim tracking just a few months ago, what could the Xiaomi Mi Band 5 have in store?

Below, we've gathered all the latest scraps of information and rumors about the upcoming band, which also includes a possible June 2020 release date.

Xiaomi Mi Band 5: How do we know it's coming?

Confirmation of the Mi Band 5's existence was revealed during a Q&A session after Huami's Q2 2019 earnings call.

In a response to a question about whether the company would continue to co-operate with Xiaomi in the future, and whether it would still produce the Mi Band 5, Wang Huang, founder, chairman of the board and chief executive officer at Huami: "We are actually developing Mi-Band 5 with Xiaomi."

In a further question about Huami's future product lineup, Wang confirmed that the work on the next-generation Mi Band is already underway and talked about a possible Mi Band 5 launch window.

So, when will the Mi Band 5 launch? Huami has stated that we may have to wait for a 2020 release date, which means it's still a little way off before we get one on our wrists. And some rumors have pointed to that being around June 2020.

Back in August 2019 Wang Huang said: "We do not have a fixed time when we're going to launch Mi Band 5", said Wang Huang. "But I would say that we have already started working on Mi Band 5 with Xiaomi and it's not going to take that long. We just launched Mi Band 4, but potentially toward the [indecipherable] of next year [2020], we may launch Mi Band 5."

However, multiple sources, including key retailer Gearbest, that are reporting a June 2020 release date. And there is some credence to that theory.

The Mi Band 4 was announced and launched in June 2019 while the Mi Band 3 rolled out in May 2018.



It's only fair, then, to assume that the new Band could launch around a similar time in 2020.

Xiaomi Mi Band 5: What will it look like?

The unveiling of Xiaomi's Hey+ 1S fitness tracker - shown above - may well have given us a glimpse at what the Mi Band 5 will look like when it is officially unveiled.

If we look back at Xiaomi's previous Hey tracker launches, many of its design cues have found their way into upcoming Mi Bands.

The Xiaomi Hey+ was released shortly after the Mi Band 3, and was extremely similar in terms of specs, but made a key change by adding a larger, color display.

That design was then closely echoed by the Mi Band 4 upon its release this year. That's leading to strong rumors that the Hey+ 1S is playing a similar role.

That new Hey+ 1S tracker doesn't appear to have made drastic changes, when compared to the Mi Band 4's design or feature set. It has, however, tweaked the display to offer a more rectangular shape with rounded corners.

It's entirely possible we'll see the Mi Band 5 follow suit with a blockier look.

Xiaomi Mi Band 5: What features will it offer?

Huang has stated that Huami will "continue to work closely with Xiaomi on new product releases" and said that its long-term plans with the popular Mi Band product line remain unchanged.

He added that it was looking forward to "developing and producing future generations of the Mi-Band, including variants targeting different global market segments and customer profiles."

Unsurprisingly, there wasn't any talk in terms of what features we could see in the Mi Band 5.

However, perhaps features that were speculated to arrive for the Band 4 may be reserved for the next one. ECG support, for instance, was something heavily rumored to land.

NFC support outside of China?

A notable new feature on Xiaomi's Hey+ 1S tracker that could make the cut is the improved NFC chip, used for contactless payments. In China, as well as being used at payment terminals, it is also used to replace work passes and bus cards.

The Xiaomi Mi Band 5 could be the first fitness tracker from the company to offer contactless payment support outside of China, according to a new leak from TizenHelp.

In the last two iterations of the Mi Band, Xiaomi has only supported contactless payments in its home territory. Could this be about to change for good?
