There are no confirmed cases of new coronavirus in Bulgaria, Serbia and Turkey, the head of Bulgaria's crisis staff against coronavirus, General Ventsislav Mutafchiyski, told a briefing on March 2.

An update posted by the World Health Organization European Region on March 2 showed that as of 10am Eastern European Time, of Bulgaria's neighbouring countries, there were seven confirmed cases in Greece, three in Romania and one in the Republic of North Macedonia, and none in Serbia and Turkey.

Mutafchiyski said that the largest increase in newly-confirmed cases of new coronavirus was in Italy, followed by South Korea, Iran and China.

He said that two people had been admitted to the Military Medical Academy in Sofia in the past 24 hours for observation. There had been no new arrivals overnight into March 2.

Professor Todor Kantardzhiev, director of the National Centre for Infectious and Parasitic Diseases and deputy head of the crisis staff against new coronavirus, said that on the recommendation of the crisis staff, the Health Ministry has decided to set up two additional laboratories for the diagnosis of new coronavirus.

These laboratories were at the University Hospital in Stara Zagora and at St Marina University Hospital in Varna. The National Reference Laboratory has supplied test kits to the two laboratories, he said.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that as of March 2, a total of 2199 cases and 38 deaths had been reported in the EU/EEA, the UK, Monaco, San Marino and Switzerland: Italy (1689), France (130), Germany (129), Spain (83), United Kingdom (36), Switzerland (24), Norway (19), Sweden (14), Austria (14), Netherlands (13), San Marino (8), Greece (7), Croatia (7), Finland (6), Denmark (4), the Czech Republic (3), Iceland (3), Romania (3), Belgium (2), Estonia (1), Ireland (1), Lithuania (1), Luxembourg (1) and Monaco (1).

Six people admitted to the Military Medical Academy for observation and tests have completed their quarantine period and will be discharged after a second test proves negative, crisis staff chief Major-General Ventsislav Mutafchiyski said.

New coronavirus is present in four of Bulgaria's neighbouring countries: 45 cases in Greece, nine in Romania, three in North Macedonia and one in Serbia, the morning briefing was told.

Following the confirmation of four cases of new coronavirus in Bulgaria, the country's government ordered a ban on all indoor cultural events, including closing theatres and cinemas.

Bulgarian Prime Minister Boiko Borissov's Cabinet met in emergency session on the morning of March 8 to decide on measures recommended by the national crisis staff against new coronavirus.

The ban on cultural events nationwide went further than the crisis staff's recommendation, which was to impose the ban only in the two towns, Pleven and Gabrovo, where the cases had been confirmed.

Culture Minister Boil Banov proposed the nationwide ban, saying that "400 to 500 people in closed rooms for two to three hours are at high risk".

First and second league football matches will be played without the public, as will indoor sports events.

The Cabinet voted to ban the export of surgical masks and other protective equipment.

Borissov ordered the Interior Ministry and State Agency for National Security to act against speculation in such items.

He rejected a recommendation to close cities where coronavirus cases were confirmed.

Health Minister Kiril Ananiev was ordered to go to Pleven and Gabrovo to inspect the situation in the two towns. Borissov ordered all members of his Cabinet to be available to him 24 hours a day and not to go to their ministries.

Borissov underlined the need for Bulgarians to exercise personal discipline and responsible behaviour and not to panic.

He spoke strongly against panic-buying and hoarding, saying that Bulgaria's large retail chains had sufficient stocks.

There were sufficient coronavirus test kits, he said. The Cabinet voted to make available to the Ministry of Health whatever funding it needed for masks and other equipment, and to provide extra beds.

Borissov said that at 2pm on March 7, he would meet representatives of large companies involved in the production of medical supplies.

Major-General Ventsislav Mutafchiyski, head of the crisis staff against coronavirus, said that all people who had been in close contact with the patients with confirmed cases were being sought as a priority, following which all those in second-line contact would be sought.

Hospitals where there were confirmed cases are quarantined and may admit only cases of extreme emergency such as heart attacks and strokes.

In areas with confirmed cases, all school extra-curricular activities such as excursions are banned.

Bulgaria has declared a nationwide influenza epidemic, closing all schools from March 6 to 11.

The order was signed on March 5 by Health Minister Kiril Ananiev, media reports said. Soon after the announcement, the ministry's website could not be accessed.

The Health Minister's order suspends routine medical consultations for women and children, routine examinations and immunisations, non-emergency surgical operations and visits to all medical establishments.

The ministry has recommended discontinuing university lectures and all large-scale public events, including sports and cultural events.

Kindergartens may remain open, but there must be screening at the entrance to check for ill children, as well as stepped-up measures for cleaning and disinfection of the premises. At the discretion of parents, children may be kept out of kindergarten until March 11.



Regional health inspectorates are charged with informing the regional governors, mayors of municipalities and medical establishments in the respective administrative area about anti-epidemic measures.

On the morning of March 5, General Ventsislav Mutafchiyski, head of the national crisis staff against new coronavirus, confirmed that there were no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Bulgaria. However, hospital wards across the country were filling up because of a major increase in cases of Type B influenza, he said.

Tests have confirmed four cases of Covid-19 new coronavirus in Bulgaria, the crisis staff announced on the morning of March 8.

The cases are a 27-year-old man and 61-year-old man in Pleven, a 75-year-old woman in Gabrovo, and a woman from the medical staff who was in contact with her.

In Pleven and Gabrovo, local staffs are meeting and awaiting instructions about further measures to be taken. No further patients are to be discharged from or admitted to hospitals in the two towns.

Bulgarian Prime Minister Boiko Borissov convened a special meeting of the Cabinet, which was set to begin at 11am.

Crisis staff chief Major-General Ventsislav Mutafchiyski said that more drastic restrictions were envisaged to be imposed than those in regard to the Type B flu epidemic.

This was likely to include a ban on indoor and outdoor public events.

Everyone who has been in contact with the patients is to be quarantined.
