New Delhi: In a bid to accelerate its global expansion, China's largest maker of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) Great Wall Motor announced its entry into the Indian market with a $1 billion-dollar investment plan. The India-entry comes at a time when both, China's economy and automobile industry, register their steepest declines in decades and local automakers look abroad to de-risk business and fuel further growth.This is the Chinese carmaker's second major market entry in recent times after Russia, increasing its global presence to about 60 nations. The company looks to establish two brands in India – Haval and GWM EV . While the former will cater to all types of SUVs, the EV brand will house non-SUV electric vehicles.The company has signed a term sheet with US' General Motors to acquire its manufacturing plant in Talegaon near Pune following the latter's exit from India. The transaction for the 137,000-unit annual capacity plant is expected to be closed in the latter half of this year. The deal is valued close to Rs 1,000 crore, say people in the know.The acquisition of an existing plant will ensure that the new entrant will have a locally-made product in the market as early as next year, the company said.“You can't get products to the market any faster,” says Hardeep Brar, director of sales and marketing at the company's Indian arm.A carmaker known for its backward integration in the value chain, Great Wall will also bring to India its critical parts supply-base – an expense part of the billion-dollar investment. The company owns about 70 firms that make components for its vehicles and has also invested in a lithium mining company, ensuring a stake in the entire EV value-chain.It is also looking to source locally and had scheduled a vendor meet with senior officials from China, but the meeting had to be cancelled following the travel ban on people from China due to coronavirus. The company however, had a meeting with potential dealer partners on Wednesday to showcase products.Great Wall Motor became the latest, but not the last Chinese automaker to enter the Indian market. Earlier, China's largest carmaker SAIC entered India with its British brand MR Motor. The company committed a capital of Rs 5000 crore to the market and its maiden vehicle Hector found many takers.Electric vehicle makers BYD and Foton too have operations in India albeit in collaboration with local partners. Meanwhile, Changan Automotive has set up a liaison office in the country.
