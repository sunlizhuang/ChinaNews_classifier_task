An industry road map that will support the growth of sustainable mining in the Philippines is expected to be completed this year, the Philippine Nickel Industry Association (PNIA) said.

“We have taken steps in engaging the Department of Environment and Natural Disaster (DENR) hopefully to have the national nickel industry roadmap this year to become legislation,” PNIA chairman Isidro Alcantara told reporters in a recent news conference.

Alcantara said the roadmap will further develop the growing nickel industry of the Philippines, saying the organization already plans the creation of a technical working group (TWG) that will be tasked to consolidate inputs from various stakeholders.

The proposed TWG will be headed by representatives from the DENR and the Department of Trade and Industry. Representatives from the PNIA and other business groups, including the European Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, will also be part of the group.

According to Alcantara, the roadmap will be necessary to incorporate the development of the nickel industry in the National Investment Priority Plan of the government.

On top of the nickel roadmap, PNIA president Dante Bravo said 2020 is the year the nickel association becomes an active partner of the government and help it achieve the Sustainable Development Goals covenant with the United Nations.

“Right now, the industry contributes 1.2 million jobs and it can add two million more if we can develop mining further. We want the people to understand the industry more,” Bravo said.

“There’s more information campaign to help us educate and collaborate on what we can do to promote mining more. We can tell more human stories on how we help uplift human lives,” he added.

Bravo said they will continuously seek sustainable mining policies so that the industry is developed in full and contribute to the economy.

Data from PNIA show the Philippines as one of the biggest producers of nickel in the world, with an estimated volume of 30 million metric tons in 2019 alone.

Around 90 percent of that were exported to China and the remaining 10 percent sent to Japan, Australia and the European Union.

For 2020, the industry leaders forecast stronger nickel production and outbound shipments on the back of higher prices resulting from the nickel export ban imposed by Indonesia.
