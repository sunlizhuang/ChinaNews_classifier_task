BEIJING, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Communist Party of China (CPC) official stressed the importance of role models in motivating officials and the general public to work hard and make accomplishments in their careers based on their individual positions.

Huang Kunming, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee, made the remarks Monday while meeting role model Chen Junwu and a delegation giving a lecture on Chen's deeds at the Great Hall of the People.

Chen, the founder of catalytic cracking engineering technology and a prestigious specialist in oil refining engineering and coal-chemical technology, was honored a "role model of the times" in October 2019 by the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee.

Huang said what Chen has done is the embodiment of the original aspiration of Chinese communists, the ethos of the Chinese nation and represents the core socialist values.

Chen's virtues and dedications should be further promoted to inspire officials, the public and those working in the science and technology field to make greater contributions, Huang noted.

More than 700 representatives from state-owned enterprises and all walks of life in Beijing attended the lecture.
