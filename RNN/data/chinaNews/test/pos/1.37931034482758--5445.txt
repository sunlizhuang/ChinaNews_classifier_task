Another workshop's being held to make feminine hygiene kits for girls, following the success of one last summer.

The 'Days for Girls' event's being held at St Mary's Church in Fordingbridge on Saturday 18th January.

Anyone's welcome to go along between 10.00am and 4.00pm to help with things like sewing, card making, ironing and adding accessories, for special hygiene kits being sent out to the African country.

WHY IS HELP NEEDED?

Girls in the developing world are skipping school when it's their time of the month, because of things like the lack of washrooms, having no access to sanitary products and simply the embarrassment of bleeding.

A study's found that girls are in danger of losing a quarter of their education as a result of their menstrual cycle.

The workshop in Fordingbridge will help to make hygiene kits containing:

washable sanitary pads

knickers

flannels

soap

They'll then be distributed by the Diocese of Kinkiizi in Uganda, which is linked to the Avon Valley Partnership of churches here.

The kits will mean girls in Uganda will be able to continue their education with dignity

Irene Canton, Days for Girls Fordingbridge Team Leader said:

"The team would like to thank everyone for their generosity and skill in supporting the Days for Girls project so far. Our aim this time is to complete kits to send out in May this year with the next group visit. With your help we should be able to compile 100 bags. This means we will have made over 1,000 items, including bags, shields and liners.



"This day will be fun and sociable but we aim to make as many kits as we can to make a real difference to the girls in Kinkiizi."
