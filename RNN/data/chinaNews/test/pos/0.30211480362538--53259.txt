For countries that evacuated their citizens from Wuhan, the Chinese Government maintained close communication and coordination with foreign diplomatic missions in Wuhan to provide help.

The epicenter Hubei set up a 24-hour hotline for foreign citizens in the province to access advice and assistance. A special column titled Fighting 2019-nCoV was established on the Foreign Ministry website, gathering the latest information from the National Health Commission to keep foreign readers updated.

China also provided assistance to other countries’ disease control efforts. For example, China alerted German officials to investigate what became the first human-to-human transmission of the virus in Europe, a man who had contact with a visiting colleague from Shanghai. By translating the Public Prevention of Pneumonia Caused by Novel Coronavirus into six foreign languages, namely English, French, Russian, German, Japan and Korean, China encouraged neighboring countries to draw from its experience in preventing the spread of infection.

To decrease the possible spread of the virus, all inbound and outbound Chinese group tours have been temporally suspended. People have also been advised to be responsible global citizens and not travel abroad in order to reduce risks to other countries.

While shouldering its global responsibility, China is making all-out efforts to contain the virus’ spread and treat those affected within the country. More than 50 million people have been effectively quarantined in Wuhan and surrounding cities. Most provinces and major cities have activated their highest level of emergency response. The annual Spring Festival holiday was extended by three days to delay the migration back to big cities, citizens were asked to stay indoors and instructed to wear face masks outside, and body temperature is being checked before people enter public places such as train stations, airports and hospitals.

China’s response impressed Tedros, who noted, “I will praise China again and again because its actions actually helped in reducing the spread of the novel coronavirus to other countries.”
