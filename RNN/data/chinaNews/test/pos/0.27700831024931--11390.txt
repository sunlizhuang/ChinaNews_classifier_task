There could be a fresh beginning between India and Pakistan at diplomatic level later this year when India plays host to Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Raveesh Kumar on Thursday said India will extend invitation to all heads of state including Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan for the SCO meet.

India Today had reported on Wednesday that India will invite Imran Khan for the SCO summit. Confirming the report, Raveesh Kumar said, "As per the established practice and procedure within the SCO, all eight members of the SCO, as well as four observer states and other international dialogue partners will be invited to attend the meeting."

"It is now a public knowledge that India will be hosting the SCO council of heads of government meeting later this year. The meeting is held annually at the prime minister's level and it discusses the SCO's program and multilateral economic and trade co-operation," Raveesh Kumar told mediapersons in New Delhi.

The SCO head of state meeting is expected to be held in the second half of the year. This is the first instance when India will be hosting the meeting of the council of heads of government of the SCO.

Dominated by China, the SCO has emerged as a significant grouping of emerging economies. It was founded at a summit in Shanghai in 2001. Russia, China, Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are the founding members.

India became part of the SCO as "observer" in 2005 and got full membership of the grouping in 2017, when Pakistan was also included as its member. India took over the presidency of the 'heads of government' meeting in 2019 at Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

The decision to invite Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan for the SCO meet is significant in the view that India-dominated South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) meetings have been derailed over ongoing tension between India and Pakistan.

Relation between India and Pakistan soured in the wake of terror attacks by outfits operating from Pakistan, and India's offensive against such groups across the Line of Control since 2016.
