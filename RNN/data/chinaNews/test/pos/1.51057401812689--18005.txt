PETALING JAYA: In a case of unrequited love, Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong says he will love everyone the same regardless of their political beliefs, even DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng.

The MCA president said this was based on the teachings of Buddhism, where it taught its followers to avoid being envious of others and to love everyone.

"Guan Eng does not understand that expressing love for mankind is not just about apple polishing.

"As a Buddhist, I was taught not to be envious of others. Is this wrong?" he questioned in a statement on Facebook on Wednesday (Jan 22).

Guan Eng had earlier dismissed a remark by Dr Wee, who was responding to questions by reporters asking whether there was any love between them despite publicly sparring on a regular basis.

"I have love for all, including Guan Eng. Only Guan Eng hates me," Dr Wee also told reporters during a Chinese New Year event in Penang.

Guan Eng, who attended the same event on a different day, was quoted as snubbing Dr Wee's "love".

"He can say he loves me, but can you believe his love? Don't be hypocritical.

"I can also choose to say that I love Dr Wee and Datuk Seri Najib Razak. But it's hard to come out of my mouth. It's too hypocritical," Guan Eng was quoted as saying.

Dr Wee said his love for mankind is universal, no matter their political beliefs.

"Doesn't matter if he is Guan Eng, Lim Kit Siang, or Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad. Every religion teaches people to be good to each other.

"Which religion teaches its followers to hold grudges against another? Love for mankind and politics are two different things.

Dr Wee said that Guan Eng's remarks reflected his character.

"It shows the true colours of Guan Eng, how he is so vengeful and suspicious of others. He couldn't even differentiate love for humans and politics," said Dr Wee.
