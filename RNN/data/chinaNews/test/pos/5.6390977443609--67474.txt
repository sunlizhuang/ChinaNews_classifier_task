Bank of Singapore, the private banking arm of OCBC Bank, has hired Joanna Ho for a newly created position as head of wealth planning for Greater China and North Asia.

Based in Hong Kong, her responsibilities include driving the expansion of the bank's wealth planning, family office, trust, succession and insurance offerings, and providing holistic solutions and advisory services to clients in those markets, Bank of Singapore says in a statement on February 10.

She reports to Angel Wu, head of the product management group in Hong Kong, and to Singapore-based Tariq Saleim, the global head of lending products, credit structuring and wealth planning.

Before joining Bank of Singapore, Ms. Ho worked for seven years at HSBC Private Banking in Hong Kong, most recently as head of wealth planning for Asia Pacific. Prior to that, she was head of wealth advisory for North Asia at Barclays Wealth.

Wealth and succession planning have "increasingly become a key concern especially among the wealthy in Asia", according to Derrick Tan, chief executive of Bank of Singapore’s Hong Kong branch and the global market head for Greater China and North Asia.

“Her [Ms. Ho’s] wealth of experience and in-depth understanding of the needs of wealthy families in Greater China is a great addition to our team as we continue to provide holistic wealth management services and solutions to our growing pool of clients in the region,” Mr. Tan says in the statement.

Bank of Singapore had US$110 billion of assets under management as of end-September 2019.
