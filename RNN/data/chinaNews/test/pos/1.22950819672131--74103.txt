Three teams from China qualified for ESL One Los Angeles Major

One week after twelve other teams were set for ESL One Los Angeles Major, the three Chinese representatives have been determined.

The Chinese qualifiers for the third wave of DPC 2019-2020 season events were postponed due to the impact CoronaVirus has had on the region.

Now the dust has finally settled and three teams are hoping to travel to the United States to participate in the ESL One Los Angeles Major set to begin March 15th. If getting visas wasn't already troublesome, the players from China now have less than a month's time to secure them —and even then, there are still some big questions lingering on how feasible it will be for them to travel to the event.

For now, Valve has not indicated any mitigation or risk management plans in the event of the teams being unable to participate, so without further ado, welcome Invictus Gaming, Royal Never Give Up and EHOME to the lineup.

The StarLadder Minor Chinese qualifiers will continue over the course of the next two days and one more team from the region —Team Aster, Newbee, Keen Gaming or Avengers will lock in a ticket for the third round of DPC events.
