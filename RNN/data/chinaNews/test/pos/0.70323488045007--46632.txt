WA's taxpayer-owned State Theatre Centre has apologised to the Chinese government after it allowed a Taiwanese performing arts group to hire its facilities.

According to the Perth Theatre Trust, the state government body which manages the theatre, the Chinese consul in WA was embarrassed when "a flag was raised that did not align with the Commonwealth's one-China policy" at a performance of the Taiwanese Acrobatic Troupe.

The People's Republic of China claims Taiwan as part of its territory, but this is rejected by the controversial east-Asian democracy, which maintains informal diplomatic relations with Australia even though its independence is not recognised by most countries.

In March last year, the Perth Theatre Trust's venues director Glenn Hall apologised in person at China's consulate in East Perth when officials requested a meeting about the Taiwanese performance.
