Health officials have confirmed another case of presumptive coronavirus in British Columbia.

This second case is a woman in her 50s who lives in the Vancouver area.

Dr. Bonnie Henry, the provincial health officer, said today that the patient had family visiting from Hubei province in China. The area is located at the centre of the outbreak.

Henry said that the visiting family members are still in Canada and are being monitored by health officials.

For the case to be confirmed, the tests must come back as positive from the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.

Henry explained that she does expect the case to be confirmed there, and if so, this will be the fifth case seen in Canada.

One other case was confirmed in BC, and three others were found in Ontario.
