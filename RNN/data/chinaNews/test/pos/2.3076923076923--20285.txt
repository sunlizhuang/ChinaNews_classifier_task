Despite the unfavorable weather conditions recorded since spring in the Argentine province of Neuquen, the optimum quality of the cherries produced in the region has allowed producers to export 75% of the harvest and thus meeting the requirements of the most demanding international markets. The main destination was China, where 41 containers were sent directly by sea thanks to the sanitary protocol that Argentina signed with China in 2018, under the G20, which allows the Neuquen to send 755 tons of cherries to that destination directly by ship.

In addition, during the last week of November and the first days of December, 180 tons of fruit were shipped by plane to the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. The 57 flights departed from Ezeiza airport.

In total, Neuquen has exported 935 tons of fresh cherries in the 2019-2020 season.

At present, the province has about 254 hectares dedicated to the production of cherries, but only 9 establishments have the infrastructure, technical-productive level, and the necessary qualifications to adapt to the export programs. These nine establishments have a total area of 190 hectares, which are distributed between the towns of Vista Alegre, Centenario, San Patricio del Cha√±ar, and Neuquen capital.

The increase in the exported volumes is due to the increase in productivity of the existing surface, driven by the progressive performance of the younger plantations. The province's total cherry production during this season reached 1,247 tons, i.e. 15% higher than in the 2018-2019 season.
