In the United States, one can easily tell when Valentine’s Day is approaching because of all the balloons, flowers and chocolates that populate every store. In America, this day is celebrated on Feb. 14 and is mostly for couples but can also celebrate friends and family as well. It is fascinating to think about how people from other cultures and countries may celebrate Valentine’s Day differently.

South Africa: South Africa celebrates Valentine’s Day with some familiar American elements like flowers, but they also have their own unique tradition. The women in this country put the names of men that they like on the sleeves of their shirts. Sometimes, this is actually the way a man finds out a woman is interested in him.

China: China celebrates “Qixi,” which is the Seventh Night Festival. For this festival, women offer fruit to Zhinu (a princess in Chinese folklore) in order to get a husband. Pre-existing couples go to temples and pray that their relationship will continue to stay healthy.

South Korea: Valentine’s Day is a popular day for young couples in this country. The holiday is actually celebrated from February up until April. On Feb. 14, women give gifts to men, but then on March 14, the men give gifts to women—which is known as White Day. There is even a day on April 14 for single people, known as Black Day. On Black Day, single people eat what is called “jajangmyeon,” or black bean-paste noodles. They do this to mourn being single.

Italy: Italy has similar traditions to people in the United States, as couples exchange gifts and eat romantic dinners. There is a popular Valentine’s Day gift given in this country, which is called “Baci Perugina.” It is a chocolate-covered hazelnut that is wrapped up with a romantic quote.

Philippines: In the Philippines, Valentine’s Day is celebrated in one of the most romantic ways possible—getting married. The Philippines have large group weddings, which is a public ceremony where hundreds of couples say “I do” at the same time and place. These ceremonies are usually free, and even include flowers and a cake.

Brazil: Brazil celebrates their version of Valentine’s Day on June 12 and there is a carnival celebration on Valentine’s Day. Brazilians celebrate Valentine’s Day similarly to Americans, but they celebrate Saint Anthony instead of Saint Valentine. Saint Anthony is celebrated in Brazil because the next day is Saint Anthony’s Day, and he is considered the saint of marriage.

Denmark: For Denmark, this is a new holiday that has only been celebrated since the 1990s. Danes give small white flowers called snowdrops to both romantic partners and friends. They also exchange lovers’ cards.

Many countries around the world take part in Valentine’s Day itself, or days similar to American Valentine’s Day. No matter where in the world one is, Valentine’s Day is a day to celebrate love and happiness, either in a romantic way or with friends and family.
