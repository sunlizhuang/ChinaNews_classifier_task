, says while the Phase I US-China deal leaves some questions unanswered, it still is a step towards calming markets’ nerves. Edited excerpts an interaction with ET NOW:The deal turned out to be somewhat less favourable than we had expected. We expected some of the September tariffs to be removed but the fact is the deal turned out to be an important step in terms of calming market nerves and in establishing that, at least, we have some form of trade truce on the horizon for 2020. It clearly leaves behind those unanswered questions on the other issues which are non-trade related. There are questions about when will Phase II negotiations even begin. While uncertainties are still there, it is a step that will calm down markets’ nerves. Even though it was a minimal set of issues that were addressed in this deal, and we still do not have any real clarity on what China will need to do and when will it happen and if and when the existing tariffs will be removed, which is a bit disappointing, at least we do have a trade deal.China does not get, as far as we can make out, the tariffs increases that were threatened i.e. the December tariffs do not get imposed on them. Given that you do have now PV space for China to better, they have agreed upon the intellectual property rights, transfer of technologies. These are things that China will have to show in good faith, that they have actually made progress on them to get the next set of relief. Certainly what China does get out of this is that the big headwind that was pushing back on Chinese growth for most of 2019 and particularly the second half of 2019 gets taken out.Russia has been you know an important part of emerging markets but it is not part of the mainstream for a variety of reasons, including the fact that there were sanctions imposed on Russia which made it very difficult for global markets to access it. So to the extent that this political uncertainty affects the Russian market . Rouble could have some impact on people’s positioning in Russian markets. But, as I said, it has for a long time been so cut off from the mainstream. Even though the political change is important and the political volatility is important and most of the impact will be on the emerging markets investors as a whole and will be felt only through what is happening to rouble.
