The U.K. has become the “unicorn” capital of Europe, creating eight new $1 billion companies in 2019, according to research published on Wednesday.

That was twice as many unicorns as Germany and three times as many as France, taking the total number of billion-dollar companies in the country to 77, a report prepared for the U.K. government by business network Tech Nation and database Dealroom showed.

These included digital health disrupter Babylon Health, which achieved unicorn status in August 2019 after raising $550 million in fresh investment, valuing the company at more than $2 billion. $450 million of the investment came from Saudi Arabia’s public investment fund, the ERGO Fund of global reinsurer Munich Re MUV2, -2.61% , and existing Babylon shareholders Swedish investors Kinnevik and Vostok New Ventures. The rest came from an undisclosed U.S. health insurer.

Another unicorn—payments processor Checkout.com—raised $230 million in May 2019 in what was Europe’s largest fintech Series A round ever.

Julia Hawkins partner at London-based venture capital fund LocalGlobe, said ambitious entrepreneurs no longer have to leave these islands and head to the U.S. to build the company of their dreams.

“The U.K.’s commitment to science research and deep tech has made huge strides in 2019 and we’re excited about the benefits that are still to come, as we develop global authority in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep tech,” Hawkins added.

Other startups making the list include Trainline which floated more than 56% of its business on the London Stock Exchange LSE, -5.45% in June 2019, valuing the transport ticketing platform at almost £1.7 billion. The shares, which were priced at 350 pence each, were trading at 467 pence on Wednesday in London.

Britain also beat the U.S. and China in technology investment, with venture capital funding for British startups in 2019 reaching its highest level in history.

Investment in the U.K.’s technology sector soared by 44% to £10.1 billion ($13.2 billion) last year, a £3.1 billion increase on 2018.

Almost half of the U.K. investments—£4.6 billion—came from U.S. and Asian investors. The nation’s technology sector recently overtook the U.S. for foreign investment per capita.

“Asian investors are taking a keen interest in the success of the U.K.’s tech sector and are enthused by our record of building unicorns and leadership in key sectors like AI [artificial intelligence] and clean tech,” said Natalie Black, Her Majesty’s Trade Commissioner for Asia Pacific.

Investments in health firm BenevolentAI ($90 million) as well as virtual reality company Melody ($60 million) and mobile robotics company Wayve ($20 million) helped push the investment total across these sectors to £2.5 billion—up from £2 billion from 2018.
