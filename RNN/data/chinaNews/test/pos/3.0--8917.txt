Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, called on the country's non-Communist parties to make new contributions to securing the victory of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and fighting poverty on Tuesday.

Xi, who is also Chinese president and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks while attending a gathering to extend Lunar New Year greetings to people from non-Communist parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and those without party affiliation.

After listening to a speech by a representative of the non-Communist parties, Xi expressed appreciation for the contributions made by non-Communist parties last year.

The non-Communist parties have maintained the authority of the CPC and followed its centralized and unified leadership in the past year, Xi said, adding that they had launched a thematic education campaign on remaining true to their original aspiration and put forward important suggestions on the CPC's governance.

Xi spoke highly of the poverty alleviation efforts made by the non-Communist parties last year, saying that these activities are important in the fulfillment of the country's poverty reduction goal.

Noting that this year is a decisive one in securing the victory of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and fighting poverty, Xi said that the non-Communist parties should make further efforts to achieve these goals.

The system of CPC-led multiparty cooperation and political consultation is a new type of political party system originated in China, Xi said, adding that the system has played a special role in achieving consensus, improving decision-making, coordinating relations and maintaining stability.

Xi said that he hoped the non-Communist parties would implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee and called on their members to follow the CPC's leadership and uphold socialism with Chinese characteristics.

Xi pointed out that the wisdom and strength of all Chinese people including people from non-Communist parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and those without party affiliation are needed to build a moderately prosperous society in all respects.

Xi told them to focus on the CPC's plans, make investigations on these goals, raise suggestions based on facts, and be good advisers to the CPC.

Noting that the CPC is making consistent efforts to build itself up, Xi said that the non-Communist parties should also build themselves up consistently and make new contributions to promote the modernization of the country's system and capacity for governance.

The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce should speed up its reforms and promote the healthy development of non-public businesses, Xi said.
