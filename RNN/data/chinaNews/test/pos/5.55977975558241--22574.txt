Dublin, Jan. 24, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Global Air Quality Monitoring System Market (2019-2025)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.



The Global Air Quality Monitoring System Market size is expected to reach $6.4 billion by 2025, rising at a market growth of 7% CAGR during the forecast period.



The market for air quality monitoring has seen steady growth due to increased levels of air pollution and increased awareness of health issues caused by polluted air.



Rapid industrialization has led to increased levels of toxic pollutants such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere in developing countries like China, India, and Brazil. Growing automobile sales in these countries have resulted in air pollution as a result of increased vehicle emissions.



To efficiently monitor and control air pollution, the implementation of air quality monitors has increased in both homes and industries. Supportive government regulations and increased public-private cooperation to reduce air pollution rates have driven the growth of the sector.



Rising levels of pollutants in the environment, as well as strict government standards and regulations for pollution control, are likely to drive demand for the product. In addition, the number of casualties as a result of respiratory diseases caused by environmental pollution has increased significantly in recent years. Subsequently, it will accelerate the demand for this product.



Based on Regions, the market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin America, Middle East & Africa. The North American and European areas have dominated the market due to the presence of a large number of air quality monitor manufacturers. Due to the growing consumer preference for clean air, the US influences the North American market.



In Europe, countries such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Russia are making a significant contribution to market growth due to strict air quality regulations. The Asia-Pacific area is expected to grow at the highest CAGR due to low air quality sensor penetration in China and India. Moreover, the Middle East and African regions offer lucrative market opportunities to market players as a result of rapid industrialization and proactive government initiatives to adopt eco-friendly processes in industries.



The major strategies followed by the market participants are Product launches and Partnerships & Collaborations. Based on the Analysis presented in the Cardinal matrix, Honeywell International, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., 3M Company, and Siemens AG are some of the forerunners in the Air Quality Monitoring System Market.
