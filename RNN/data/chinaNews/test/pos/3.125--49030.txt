Tesla TSLA has had a significant impact on the auto industry, which is witnessing digital transformation. It has an ambitious vision for a future of electric and autonomous vehicles, which is highly encouraging. Notably, since its IPO in 2010, Tesla has skyrocketed 2,623%, breezing past the S&P 500’s 224% total return during the decade. Over the past few months, the stock has been on a tear. This streak of the electric vehicle (EV) pioneer continued in fourth-quarter 2019, wherein it easily topped earnings and revenue estimates.

January 2020 was Tesla’s best month since 2013, wherein it added $40 billion in market capitalization. The company, which is currently valued at more than $115 billion, zoomed past the combined value of General Motors GM and Ford F. Tesla is currently the second-most valuable car manufacturer, just behind Toyota Motor TM. While Tesla has taken the financial markets by storm with its breathtaking rally and achieved various milestones, one key question remains: When will this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company enter the prestigious S&P 500 club? You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Eligibility Criteria for Inclusion in the S&P 500

The S&P 500 is a market-capitalization-weighted index of the 500 largest U.S. publicly-traded companies. What’s important, it actually makes up for around 80% of the total U.S. stock market capitalization. So, how does a stock get added to the S&P 500 Index? Well, among several criteria that are needed to be met, which include: a company should be headquartered in the United States and have a market capitalization of at least $8.2 billion (this number fluctuates according to the stock market’s booms and busts).The stock price must be at least $1 per share and the company must file 10K annual report. Moreover, at least 50% of the firm’s stock must be available to the public, and a minimum of 50% of its fixed assets and revenues must be generated in the United States.

Finally, the last reported quarter should be profitable for the stock and aggregate profit is needed to be generated over the trailing four quarters. The S&P inclusion criterion on their website states, “The sum of the most recent four consecutive quarters’ Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) earnings (net income excluding discontinued operations) should be positive as should the most recent quarter.”

What’s Hindering Tesla’s Entry Into the S&P 500?

Notably, Tesla is the most valuable U.S. firm that is not in the S&P 500 list. While the EV maker qualifies to join the S&P 500 Index in terms of every other parameter including liquidity, market cap and domestic headquarters, there is just one hurdle to be crossed. And that criterion is profitability.

Tesla has not been able to achieve profitability for four consecutive quarters. While the firm raked in net income of $105 million and $143 million in the fourth and third quarters of 2019, respectively, it reported a combined loss of $1,110 million in the first two quarters of 2019. As such, Tesla requires to report earnings in the next two quarters to become eligible to be part of the S&P 500 before 2020.

Tesla Could Join the S&P 500 This Year

Tesla’s second consecutive quarter of profit brings it a step closer to its inclusion in the S&P 500 Index. With two straight profitable quarters and various tailwinds surrounding the company, we believe that a ‘sustained profitability’ promised by the CEO Elon Musk is well within the realm of possibility for Tesla.

There are a number of catalysts to support the company’s earnings going forward, which will enable it to make its debut in the S&P 500 list this year.

High demand for Model 3 vehicle is definitely a booster. In full-year 2019, Tesla delivered 367,500 vehicles, reflecting an increase of 50% year over year. For full-year 2020, the company expects vehicle deliveries to exceed 500,000 units. Higher volumes should enable Tesla to achieve cost and production efficiencies, thereby strengthening margins.

Automotive gross profit is on the rise over the last three quarters and the company seems to be trying its best to eke out more gross profits in the coming quarters. With production anticipated to increase and improved battery cell costs, the trend is not expected to reverse anytime soon.
