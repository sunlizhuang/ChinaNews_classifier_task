This week we got to hold a very fun party at the Manhattan restaurant Chinese Tuxedo to celebrate this editorial package put out by Eater New York. The guest list included longtime established restaurateurs, up-and-coming power players, and all manner of other fun people who like good food and drink.

The editorial package examines what power means now in New York City dining and how it’s shifted over the last decade or so. Who are the secret power brokers behind the scenes? Does PR matter? How much does it cost to open something these days? Who is the new guard and what does the Establishment have to say about it and their legacy? Where are the uber-rich dining these days? (Spoiler: sushi bars and members-only restaurants.) Are there even celebrity chefs anymore?

This week, The Spotted Pig closed and Daniel Humm exited the NoMad. They are very different stories but both signal an end of a certain era. It was a fitting coincidence for me in a week where we celebrated this new wave of influence. I’m very much looking forward to the restaurants, projects, and talent the new decade will bring.
