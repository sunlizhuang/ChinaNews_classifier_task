In November 2019, the Monte-Carlo International Circus Festival and Chimelong Group formally established a strategic cooperation. The logo representing the collaboration was unveiled at the venue of the Monte-Carlo International Circus Festival. Kiko and Kika, Chimelong Group's two mascots, gave the first performance and interacted with Monaco denizens, adding a new twist to the traditional local carnival.

Su Zhanhang, Vice President of Chimelong Group, who is also a judge of the 44th Monte-Carlo International Circus Festival attended the festival and several circus-themed international conferences, events and banquets. Mr. Su pointed out that there is enormous potential for circus cooperation between China and Europe. The European circus industry hopes to enter into the Chinese market while China looks to spread its circus culture to Europe, opening up significant opportunities for collaboration between the Monte-Carlo International Circus Festival and Chimelong Group.

"Through cooperation, we will jointly promote our circus festivals as well as circus art and culture worldwide. Chimelong also plans to establish a circus academy in China, providing a venue where circus talents from all over the world can exchange ideas," Mr. Su said.

Princess Stéphanie of Monaco, president of the Monte-Carlo International Circus Festival, said that the efforts made by Chimelong Group to promote the development of circus culture are evident to all and that the cooperation between the two sides will be inevitable and long-lasting. Everyone at the Monte-Carlo International Circus Festival is moved by the Chinese delegation's spirit of constant improvement and exploration, which is the key to the excellent reputation that Chinese circus programs have gained in Europe. "Audiences in Monaco and Europe are learning about Chinese culture through the circus, which serves as a bridge for cross-cultural communication."
