UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy on Tuesday reiterated China's firm support for the Palestinian people's just cause to restore their legitimate national rights, in the wake of the unveiling of a controversial U.S. Middle East peace plan.

China takes note of the U.S. announcement of its new Middle East peace plan and the responses of Palestine, the Arab League, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the UN secretary-general and others, said Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations.

China always believes that the relevant UN resolutions and such international consensus as a two-state solution and the land-for-peace principle constitute an important foundation for solving the question of Palestine, and must be effectively observed, he told the Security Council, which met to discuss the U.S. plan.

The question of Palestine can only be solved through political means. Any proposal must be based on heeding the views and opinions of the major parties, in particular those of Palestine, as well as the voices of regional countries and organizations. Any such proposal must come up with dialogue and negotiation on an equal footing, and must contribute to a comprehensive, fair and lasting solution, said Zhang.

In the past few days, Security Council members held intensive consultations on the question of Palestine, he said. China supports the efforts by Tunisia and Indonesia toward a draft resolution, and believes that the council should base its work on the resolutions adopted in the past, heed the voices of the Palestinian people, reaffirm its support for the two-state solution and the importance of relevant resolutions and existing international consensus.

The draft, which had been intended for a vote on Tuesday, was withheld, apparently to allow more time for consultations.

China calls on all the parties to comply with international law in order to prevent further complication and deterioration of the situation. China encourages all the parties to continue consultations in a responsible manner, narrow differences, and widen consensus with a view to creating favorable conditions for solving this issue, he said.

Zhang said that China is concerned about the economic and humanitarian situation in Palestine.

China calls on the parties concerned to seriously fulfill the international treaty obligations, comprehensively implement the relevant resolutions, speedily and fully lift the blockade on Gaza and improve the economic and humanitarian situation in the occupied Palestinian territory, he said.

The international community must increase its political and financial support to the UN agency for Palestine refugees so as to effectively improve the humanitarian situation of the Palestinian refugees and their host countries and increase input into the economic reconstruction in Palestine.

The Security Council bears the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. Under the current circumstances, the council should work with the international community and play a constructive role in seeking a comprehensive, fair and lasting solution to the question of Palestine, said Zhang.

The Palestinian issue, which remains unresolved for over 70 years, is the root cause of the turbulence in the Middle East. The issue has been questioning human conscience and international justice, he said.

Independent statehood is an inalienable national right of the Palestinian people and not something for trading at all. Currently, the Palestinian people are still undergoing huge suffering. China is deeply worried about the incessant clashes and confrontations between Palestinians and Israelis, the continuing and expanding settlement activities and demolition of Palestinian houses, and deviation of the Middle East peace process from the right track, said the Chinese ambassador.
