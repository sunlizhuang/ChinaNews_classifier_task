If you are an avid traveler then one or all of the new seven wonders of the world may be on your bucket list. The new seven wonders of the world are a group of ancient monuments chosen by the New7Wonders Foundation. The new seven wonders of the world were chosen based on the voting of people from all over the world. The original list of seven wonders was compiled in the second century, and only the Great Pyramid of Giza is still standing. There has been some controversy surrounding the new seven wonders of the world. Prominent monuments like Angkor Wat and the Acropolis did not make the final cut.

Great Wall Of China - China

If you plan on visiting the Great Wall of China there are a few things to know. If you plan on hiking be sure to check to weather first. Wear comfortable hiking shoes and use the bathroom at the valley beforehand. The summer season can be very crowded, so consider visiting in spring or fall instead. Avoid visiting during Chinese holidays and don’t litter. There are dangers you must watch out for on the wall. Watch out for scammers offering group tours, and be careful when taking photos. You can lose your balance and fall if you attempt to take a photo in a dangerous position.

Petra - Jordon

You can save a lot of money by purchasing a Jordan pass, which allows you to visit all the tourist attractions in the country for an affordable price, including Petra. Wear comfortable shoes if you plan on walking, but a camel or donkey ride might offer a more authentic experience. There is no dress code at Petra, but you should bring sunscreen because it can be unbearably hot in the summer.

Christ the Redeemer - Brazil

Christ the Redeemer has been overlooking Rio de Janeiro since the statue was built in 1931. If you plan on visiting, do so during the offseason. Christmas and Carnival are poor times to visit because the site will be too congested. Be prepared with proper hiking gear if you plan to take the trail to the top. You can also use a combination of train, taxi, or shuttle if you want to reach the top sooner. Early morning on a weekday is the best time to visit because you will avoid the crowds and be able to take a selfie that is unobstructed by the glare of the sun.

Machu Picchu - Peru

Machu Picchu is really safe, but there are hazards. Be sure to pack a poncho or rain jacket because the weather can change in a second. Make sure you have all the proper hiking gear, and watch your step because many of the pathways are steep and narrow. Pack some bug spray as there are many insects that can sting and bite in the area. Use the washroom before you go, and pack some snacks. The most important tip is that you must bring your passport. You must have your passport stamped before you enter Machu Picchu. Having your passport stamped when you enter Peru will not suffice.

Chichen Itza - Mexico

Chichen Itza covers 740 acres, and it is one of the most visited tourist spots in all of Mexico. The entrance fee is about $13 USD, but you must pay in Mexican pesos. The best time to visit Chichen Itza is in the early morning or late afternoon. The weather will be cooler and the crowds will be thinner. Plan your schedule ahead of time because you will need about three hours to see everything.

Colosseum - Italy

Book your tour to the Colosseum early because spaces fill up fast. Be sure to pack light because large backpacks are not allowed inside the Colosseum. Make sure to respect the culture and history. Pack a rain jacket or poncho in case of inclement weather. The Colosseum steps can be very slippery when it is raining.

Taj Mahal - India

If you plan on visiting all the new seven wonders of the world you might want to visit this one first because the Taj Mahal is actually sinking. Avoid the summer and rainy season by visiting sometime between November and February. Tickets cost about $15 USD for foreigners but you can save a little bit of money by using cashless payment. The Taj Mahal is closed on Fridays for prayer observation.

Great Pyramid - Egypt (Honorary Candidate)

If you want to see every inch of the pyramid complex you will have to purchase multiple tickets. A general ticket doesn’t cover everything. Your main ticket will allow you to enter the tomb beneath the pyramids, but when you exit you will be asked to pay a tip. Wear light clothing that doesn’t reveal too much skin, and bring plenty of water. You should stay at a hotel that is as close to the pyramids and possible, and be sure to visit early in the morning to avoid crowds.

Voting and Natural Wonders

The new seven wonders of the world are unique monuments that attract visitors from all over the world. More than 100,000,000 votes were cast to determine which monuments would make the final list. The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only wonder of the ancient world that is still standing. The New7Wonders Foundation also compiled a list of seven natural wonders, which includes the Amazon Rainforest, Jeju Island, Komodo Island, and Table Mountain.
