Barbados’ Fish and Dragon Festival, which is now in its sixth year, can be expanded and used as a means of drawing Chinese tourists to Barbados.

Adisa “AJA” Andwele, Director of AJA Productions, suggested the above as he chaired the Media Launch for the upcoming Fish and Dragon Festival, which was held at The Embassy of The People’s Republic of China in Barbados yesterday. The Festival, sponsored by the Embassy and the Central Bank of Barbados, will meanwhile take place on Saturday, January 18, 2020 at 5 p.m. at the Garfield Sobers Gymnasium.

“We are in the sixth year. Maybe by the tenth year or even before, we can look at using the Fish and Dragon Festival as a mechanism for the people of China who want to come to Barbados, to come during the Festival. So we can expand it and take it to a whole different level,” AJA remarked.

He added, “Obviously, we would have to start marketing it a year before to do that. So we have to establish the date, who is the troupe that is coming from China, so then we can start to promote it a year or at least nine months in advance, where then we could see traffic from China coming here.”

“We could also do the opposite as well, where we start a Barbadian/Caribbean Festival in China. So that would be real integration between Barbados and China or the Caribbean and China. But it is something that we can explore, moving the Fish and Dragon Festival up to another level, where we can direct Chinese tourists to Barbados,” he stressed.

Philomena Lee, of the Chinese Association of Barbados, has lent her support to this idea, noting that the interest in Barbados as a tourism destination has been constantly increasing in China.

Lee, who has a son presently residing in China, noted that he comes every year and often takes back Crop Over costumes and other artefacts for display for the West Indian Association in China, which in turn also invites regional artistes to China to perform.

So the interest is growing there, she said.

“So the knowledge of the Caribbean has been widening. So what AJA said is actually the next logical step, where perhaps we can create more links and fusions between our Fish and Dragon Festival, which I believe is the only one in the Caribbean right now, and these events in China, to make people much more aware,” Lee stated.

“The second thing is, that in fact we have quite a bit more Chinese tourists actually coming, because of the different exchange programmes and awareness that has been created, and whenever they come, they generally have been enjoying themselves and going back and promoting Barbados,” Lee meanwhile stated.

The Fish and Dragon Festival, slated for adults and children alike, will feature both Chinese and local cultural performances. Special guests will be The Jilin Performing Arts Troupe from China.
