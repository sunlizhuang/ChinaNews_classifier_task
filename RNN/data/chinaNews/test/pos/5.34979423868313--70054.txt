It’s February in Scotland, so this Editor’s Diary begins with a wintry turn in the weather!

A succession of wet weekends have interrupted my walking schedule.

It feels like ages since I was last out for a good long walk. And I’m missing it!

It also means I don’t have any new photographs taken on my travels to share with you.

So instead, here’s a beautiful picture of Antibes in France, basking in glorious sunshine.

I took it on a visit to the glorious south of France in autumn 2018. It’s a reminder of sunnier times to come!

It’s also a clue as to how some of those wet weekend days have been spent. They’re rubbish for walking — but ideal for planning holidays!

Later this year, I’m hoping to make a return visit to the south of France. It’s a part of the world that I love, and I’m lucky enough to have been many times before.

Sometimes, when it comes to holidays, it’s good to explore somewhere new and stretch your horizons.

But there’s also a lot to be said for revisiting favourite places. And this year, after 2019’s super-adventurous trip to Shanghai, I’m looking forward to relaxing in a familiar and much-loved setting.

Of course, I will be telling you all about it in a future Editor’s Diary, too!
