Editor's Note: Tens of thousands of foreigners live in China. How are their lives affected by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus? China Daily talked to two expats staying in the country.

As an expat who's been studying and living in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, for seven years, I am deeply impressed and moved by the unity and courage of Chinese people in their fight against the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which in my eyes showcases the amazing power and charm of the country.

I came to China from Russia in 2013 with a strong sense of curiosity and passion for the ancient Chinese culture. In recent years, I have left my footprints in many villages in China and have written piles of poems about the country and its people. For me, China is my second home, an indispensable part of my life.

After the virus broke out ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year, I dropped my plan of spending the holiday in a Zhejiang village.

Instead, I stayed in Hangzhou and used my poems to express my support.

I am confident in China's final success in the battle against the virus due to the indomitable vitality and perseverance drawn from its 5,000-year-old civilization and robust course of development.

The strong measures taken by China have eliminated my concerns and have also eased the worries of my Russian family.

Amid the epidemic pneumonia, I see people across China joining hands and facing up to the challenge together: Medics from around the country joining the fight against the virus; people echoing the call of the government to stay at home; and organizations and individuals spontaneously making donations. I respect these people who always hold confidence and hope in the face of challenges and difficulties. The spirit is contagious.

I believe that after the virus outbreak subsides, China will do more to make our living environment cleaner and prettier, and people will appreciate their healthy and happy lives more deeply.
