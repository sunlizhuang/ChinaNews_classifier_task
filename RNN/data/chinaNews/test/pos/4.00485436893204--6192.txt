It’s often said that, politically, we live in an age of populism – but is this true in the sphere of visual art? Judging by the centrepiece of Tate Modern’s spring programme – a massive Andy Warhol retrospective – you’d be forgiven for thinking so. I vividly remember the gallery’s definitive Warhol show of 2002.

Given the mind-numbing recurrence since then of exhibitions about the American Pop artist, what is there left to say? Arguably, we need another Warhol exhibition like a hole in the head. Yet his name still guarantees box-office success – which is why, I guess, Tate’s exhibition is happening.

Certainly, when I look back over the past couple of decades of art in this country, a populist tendency is among the most dominant trends. The great driver in this regard was the opening of Tate Modern and the annual Turbine Hall commissions that ensued. Curators took a pickaxe to the intimidating, highbrow edifice that was modern art, and replaced it with a warmer, more inclusive vision, characterised by accessible, family-friendly installations featuring shiny slides (Carsten Höller’s “Test Site”, 2006) and orange swings (Superflex’s “One Two Three Swing!”, 2017). Curators earnestly categorise this sort of participatory approach as “relational aesthetics”. I think of it as “funhouse art”.

Arguably, we are now witnessing the apotheosis of this “movement”. Every second press release I receive describes a forthcoming exhibition as “immersive”. Shows, these days, are no longer straightforward exhibitions, but “experiences”. (What exhibition, you might counter, doesn’t offer an “experience”?) VR headsets in galleries are an increasingly common sight, as curators believe that new technology offers a silver bullet to widen their demographic. Yet, to date, the VR “experiences” on offer are routinely drab, unsubtle kitsch. Anyone watching “Mona Lisa: Beyond the Glass”, an “immersive” (so says the blurb) “VR experience” that is part of the Louvre’s ongoing Leonardo blockbuster, risks being turned off Renaissance portraiture for life. I have nothing against technology in galleries, I just wish it were put to better use.

In a related trend, we may also observe the unstoppable rise of fashion shows. Last year’s “Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams” became the most visited exhibition in the V&A’s history. Even the Wallace Collection has succumbed, showing footwear by the shoe designer Manolo Blahnik alongside Fragonard. Frans Hals’s Laughing Cavalier, it seems, can no longer be trusted to pull in the punters.
