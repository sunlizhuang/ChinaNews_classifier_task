Following the Taal Volcano erruption on January 12, the Philippines’ closest international allies wasted no time in extending aid to thousands of Filipinos who were evacuated from their homes to safety. As the lockdown in danger zones continue, so does the generosity of the diplomatic community via their embassies in Manila.

China

Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian on January 22 met with Undersecretary Enrique Manalo of Department of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines and turned over P7.5 million for the relief and rehabilitation of the areas affected by Taal volcano’s eruption on behalf of the Embassy.





Ambassador Huang expressed his deep sympathies to those Filipino friends affected by the recent volcano eruption of the Philippines. He said that the Chinese side looks forward to lending more strength to the disaster relief efforts on the Philippine side to overcome the difficulties and help the affected people restore their normal livelihood at an earliest date.

Ambassador Huang also extended his Spring Festival greetings to the overseas Chinese in those areas.

Japan

The government of Japan decided to provide in-kind emergency assistance of anti-dust respirators and others through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in response.

“As a Volcanic Country like the Philippines, Japan has repeatedly experienced hardship caused by volcanic activities in its history. We are in solidarity with the people of the Philippines in facing this challenge,” Japan Embassy said in a statement.

“The government made the above decision on rendering emergency relief from a humanitarian point of view, and in light of the friendship between Japan and of the Philippines,” the statement added.

United States

Meanwhile, during a visit to a school serving as an evacuation center in Nasugbu, Batangas on January 22, US Ambassador to the Philippines Sung Kim announced the provision of P5.1 million in US government support to those affected by the January 12 Taal volcanic eruption. Ambassador Kim also joined Philippines Disaster Resilience Foundation (PDRF) partners to distribute supplies to evacuees in Calatagan.

With this new funding, the United States government, through US Agency for International Development (USAid) partner World Vision, is providing relief supplies including soap, sleeping mats, and blankets, to nearly 7,600 people in the Nasugbu West Central School evacuation center in Batangas.

This newly announced US assistance complements existing support to transport emergency supplies to evacuees, provide technical assistance to manage evacuation centers, and loan specialized equipment and analytic support to monitor the Taal volcano.

Earlier, South Korean Ambassador Han Dong-man turned over $200,000 or about P10 million to the Philippine Red Cross, an amount seen to help about 45,000 people displaced in the region.
