A Singapore couple had to get creative when it came to their wedding day amid coronavirus fears. According to BBC, Joseph Yew and Sang Ting had to live-stream into their own wedding. This is because of a recent trip the pair took to the Hunan province, which borders Hubei, the province where the coronavirus originated.

“When guests expressed concerns about attending, the couple found a way to allay their fears. The bride and groom stayed away, instead live streaming themselves into a venue full of friends and family.” BBC adds, “The wedding couple made their toasts and their speeches entirely over the video call, to the amusement of their guests seated in the wedding hall.”

The groom says that they wanted to postpone the wedding, but the hotel was not accommodating. “They said everything had been arranged and it was non-negotiable. So we felt like we had no choice but to proceed with the wedding.” He also says, “We told the guests we would video conference in… some of them were shocked. I think if we had been there, the atmosphere would be different. People would have been wary.”

The couple ended up dialing into the wedding from the hotel room they were staying in, which was in the saying hotel where the wedding took place. “The hotel also delivered champagne to the couple. They popped the cork in their room after giving their celebratory toasts and speeches, which was all live-streamed for guests at the wedding.”

So far, the coronavirus has killed around 550 people in China.
