By February 10, 2020, the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has infected over 40,000 people in 29 countries, with the majority of them in China. Over 1,000 patients have lost their lives.

Many cities in China have suffered from the epidemic, including two of Toledo’s sister cities in China: Qinhuangdao and Nanchong. By February 10, there were 32 confirmed cases in Nanchong and 9 in Qinhuangdao. Qinhuangdao and Nanchong reached out to Toledo Sister Cities International (TSCI) on Jan 30th and asked for HELP, especially for N95 or KN95 face masks and disposable medical gowns. On Feb 9, the TSCI-QHD/NC Committee invited local community leaders to discuss QHD/NC’s requests for helps and decided to initiate a fund-raising campaign for the two sister cities. The TSCI worked with Toledo City Council (TCC) closely, and the TCC will pass a resolution on February 11 to support the TSCI’s fund-raising efforts. We would encourage all local communities to help us make the fund-raising successful. TSCI has set up a special account to collect donations. ALL HELP COUNTS!

(A) As many Chinese people may have donated through different channels or have shown more concerns about the situation in Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic. Why Qianhuangdao and Nanchong now? Wuhan certainly needs more help and are in urgent need than other cities do. However, Wuhan also has attracted worldwide attention and received help from many places. Comparatively, TSCI’s two Chinese sister cities do not get much help. Thus, QHD/NC Committee decided to focus on fund-raising for QHD/NC. Given this, if anyone is interested in donating to Wuhan, it is also greatly appreciated and we would be glad to find a way to transfer any received money to Wuhan. (B) The two sister cities have requested support of face masks such as N95 or KN95 and disposable medical gowns. However, given the worldwide shortage of these products, it may be hard or at least inconvenient for individual donors to get these products directly. Thus, QHD/NC Committee decides to solicit for money donation for the time being. Then, QHD/NC Committee will search for suppliers/sellers and purchase the products needed by the two sister cities when the fund-raising campaign ends on Feb 24th, 2020 . If anyone has direct access to suppliers of N95 or KN95 or medical gowns, it would be great to ask their donations. (C) If QHD/NC fails to find any suppliers for the products, all collected funds will be sent to the two sister cities according to their guideline and instruction. (D) How much money is expected to raise? When will the fund-raising complete? Given that TSCI has two Chinese sister cities, our hope is to get at least $10,000 for each city. Our first period of fund-raising campaign ends on Feb 24th, 2020. (E) Information for all donations will be available to all donors and local community groups who are interested in knowing it. ALL HELP COUNTs. THANK YOU ALL!!!
