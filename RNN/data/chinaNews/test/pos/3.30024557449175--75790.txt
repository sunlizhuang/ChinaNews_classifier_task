DUBLIN, Feb. 18, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The "Global Wine Market 2019-2025" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global wine market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 3.7% during the forecast period. The wine industry valued at $157.6 billion in 2018, is estimated to reach $201.2 billion in 2025.



Health benefits and premiumization of wine products along with innovation in flavor and more advanced distribution networks across the globe are the major factors that drive the growth of the global wine market. The wine contains antioxidants that, when consumed, fight with free radicals to avoid diseases such as cancer. Additionally, the growing demand in emerging economies such as China and India are also contributing to the global wine market.



According to the Wine Institute of the US, the consumption of wine has been increased over the past 4 years from 919 million gallons in 2015 to 966 million gallons in 2018. However, the consumption of wine per individual has not seen a sharp increase. In 2015, the wine consumption per individual was 2.86 gallons and in 2018 the wine consumption per individual was 2.95 gallons.



According to the World Health Organization, in 2016, wine holds 28% of share (in terms of volume) in the overall alcoholic beverage consumption across the globe. Barefoot, Concha Toro, Gallo, Changyu, Yello Tail, Sutter Home, Robert Mondavi, hardy's, Beringer, and Great Wall among others are the major wine brands across the globe.



The prominent companies in the wine market are Constellation Brands, Treasury Wine Estates, and Accolade Wines. These market players adopt several strategies in order to stay competitive in the market. For instance, in April 2019, Bishop Cider had Launched Uncommon Wines which is a woman-powered session' wine in a can. This wine contains less than 5% of alcohol by volume, therefore, it is termed as a session beer.
