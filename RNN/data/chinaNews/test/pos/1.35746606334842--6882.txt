High refresh rate panels were the defining trend of 2019, with most manufacturers offering phones with 90Hz displays. It looks like that's set to continue in 2020, with 120Hz displays set to become the norm. Xiaomi rolled out the Redmi K30 series with a 120Hz display, and Samsung's Galaxy S20 series is also heavily rumored to sport a 120Hz panel.

OnePlus is now joining in on the action, with CEO Pete Lau revealing on Weibo that the company has "completed research and development" of 120Hz display tech. OnePlus showed off the display tech at the Screen Technology Communication Meeting in China to earlier today, with Lau noting that OnePlus will offer the "best smartphone display in 2020'."

OnePlus went with 90Hz panels on most of its phones last year, so it makes sense for the company to make the switch to 120Hz panels in 2020. From Lau:

We believe that the smoothest smartphone display must also be able to deliver a superior visual quality and viewing comfort. We're sure that OnePlus's new 120Hz Fluid Display will be the best you'll lay eyes on in 2020.

Lau has also confirmed that OnePlus' upcoming flagship will retain a QHD+ resolution, along with MEMC (motion smoothing) for smoother video playback, and 4096 levels of automatic brightness control. It's a big deal that OnePlus is focusiing on its display as being the differentiator for the OnePlus 8, because that's usually what Samsung does. It will be interesting to see just how good that panel is, and how it holds up against the Galaxy S20.
