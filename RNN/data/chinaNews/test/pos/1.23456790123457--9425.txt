BEIJING, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese mainland will never give up on the young people in Taiwan, said a spokesperson on Wednesday.

The mainland will continue to promote cross-Strait communication and carry out policies to enhance mutual understanding between the young people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, said Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesperson with the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, at a regular briefing.

"Guided by the conviction that we are all of the same family, the mainland has rolled out a series of policies to provide Taiwan compatriots, especially young people, with equal treatment and development opportunities on the mainland," Ma noted.

These policies have proved effective as more and more young people in Taiwan have come to the mainland to study, work and start up businesses in recent years, he added.

Ma made the remarks when asked about the mainland's future policy toward youth in Taiwan.
