After being unable to appoint a Council President Pro Tem at its last meeting on Jan. 6, Westland City Council voted Mike Londeau to the position on Tuesday,

Londeau, who garnered the second-most votes during the Nov. 2019 election, is currently serving his second term. He's replacing Councilman Peter Herzberg, who was also nominated for the role.

"I look forward to serving in this leadership role... I know Councilman Hart and I take great pride in this role," he said.

On Jan. 6, Londeau and Herzberg failed to receive enough votes to become pro tem, with Councilwoman Tasha Green choosing to vote against both of them. But, Councilman Jim Godbout voted in favor of Londeau on Tuesday after previously voting for Herzberg, giving the councilman four votes and ending the pro tem process.

Godbout said later in an email that he also would have voted in Herzberg's favor. However, council did not vote on Herzberg because Londeau earned enough votes.

Councilwoman Andrea Rutkowski and President Jim Hart joined Godbout in voting for Londeau, who voted for himself. At the meeting's end, Herzberg congratulated Londeau on his appointment.
