Gateshead pharmaceutical firm Shield Therapeutics has signed a $22m deal to sell its drugs in Asia.

The company has struck a deal with Beijing Aosaikang Pharmaceutical Co (ASK Pharm) to sell its iron deficiency drug Feraccru in China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.

The deal sees Shield receive an up-front payment of $11.4 (£8.67m) with the company also set to receive a further $11.4m once Feraccru receives regulatory approval in China.

On top of this, Shield will also be paid up to $40m (£30.42m) if the drug hits sales targets and is eligible to receive between 10% and 15% of net sales across the region.

Carl Sterritt, chief executive officer of Shield Therapeutics, said: “I am delighted to announce this agreement with ASK Pharm, who have been determined to succeed throughout a competitive licensing process for Feraccru/Accrufer in China.

“They are an ambitious and successful pharmaceutical company with an excellent track record of product development and commercial success. Their established product development and commercial infrastructure and expertise in China should speed the regulatory approval and drive subsequent sales of Feraccru/Accrufer.

“The market in China for novel prescription pharmaceuticals continues to grow rapidly and this agreement will mean more patients with iron deficiency will benefit from Feraccru/Accrufer therapy, enabling them to enjoy the things that make a difference in their everyday lives.

“We very much look forward to working with ASK Pharm and supporting them as they advance the Feraccru/Accrufer franchise in China.”

ASK Pharm was established in 2003 in Nanjing, China, and is listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange. The business focuses on oncology therapies and is one of China’s biggest manufacturers of proton pump inhibitor and oncology medications.

Qingcai Chen, chairman of ASK Pharm, said: “We are very happy to enter into this agreement with Shield Therapeutics, a leading innovative pharmaceutical company that has shown its product development expertise through the approvals for Feraccru/Accrufer in Europe and the USA.

“ASK Pharm will now work closely with Shield to rapidly complete any required clinical development in China and bring this revolutionary product to patients with iron deficiency as early as possible.

“This co-operation will expand our company’s therapeutic area experience and improve our competitiveness, whilst also creating a new development and commercialisation opportunity for ASK Pharm.”

The Asia deal is a major step for Shield, which has hit a number of hurdles with its drug in the past. Its biggest issue occurred when the Feraccru missed its trial targets meaning the drug would not be allowed to sell in the US.

The company has since carried out another trial in the US, and Feraccru has gained FDA approval.

Mr Sterritt said: “We look forward to updating the market on progress with ongoing discussions relating to the commercialisation of Feraccru/Accrufer in the US. As previously indicated the priority is to secure a highly motivated partner on attractive commercial terms rather than completing the process to a particular deadline.”
