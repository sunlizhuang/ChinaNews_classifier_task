David Becker/Getty Images via ABCChristmas came in January for high school students this week in South Florida when Ludacris donatedmusical instruments worth $75,000.

The Fast & Furious star made an unexpected visit to Hialeah-Miami Lakes Senior High School on Wednesday, and opened a curtain in the auditorium to reveal the free instruments.

“It feels great, especially understanding how expensive it is," Ludacris told ABC Miami affiliate WPLG-TV. “I’m very thankful, especially on such an important weekend."

The three-time Grammy winner also surprised the school band director, Kevin Segura, with two tickets to the Super Bowl.

Tonight, Luda will perform at The Road to #F9 Fast & Furious free concert at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. He will joined on stage by Cardi B, Wiz Khalifa, Charlie Puth, Ozuna, and cast members from the ninth installment in the franchise, including Vin Diesel and Tyrese.
