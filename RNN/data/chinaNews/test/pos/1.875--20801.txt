Coronation Street newcomer Sian Reeves has called for her character Charlie to stick around on the cobbles after her first stint on the show comes to an end.

Charlie has been introduced as part of Tim Metcalfe's (Joe Duttine) bigamy storyline as the builder recently found out that his joke marriage to Charlie (Sian Reeves) was legally binding.

While Tim has been trying to get his wife to sign divorce papers, Charlie has been busy causing her own mischief after landing a job at the Rovers and getting in between Tim and Sally (Sally Dynevor).

And now the actress has shared that she's having so much fun on the soap that she wants her character to stick around for a while.

"I couldn’t possibly say, but yes it would be really nice," Sian said on Lorraine this morning (January 23) when asked if she would be staying on the soap for a bit longer.



"I have had such a nice time there, but I was committed to By The Waters Of Liverpool."

The actress will be starring in a production of Helen Forrester's By The Waters Of Liverpool, which is touring the UK between March 3 and May 13, meaning that Charlie will likely be off our screens for a considerable stretch of time while Sian is committed to the other project.

But she's certainly not ruling out returning to the cobbles once her theatre stint is over, as Lorraine Kelly added: "We want you back."

"Oh, thank you, Lorraine," Sian replied, before jokingly adding: "Did you hear that? Tweet in!"

During the chat, Sian also opened up about her character, promising viewers that she's not as trouble-making as she may appear to be.

"As this story progresses, you'll see that she's a nice girl," Sian shared. "And she is an air hostess, so she travels around the world, and I've got a friend who does that and you don't really know how much time passes when you're away from home.

"So she has used [having a husband] to the people who perhaps might be after her. Then when he chases her and finds her, she is so excited because no one has done that before."
