SINGAPORE, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Chinaâ€™s state-controlled Beijing Gas Group has won state approval to build a terminal to receive liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday.

One of the sources said the approved capacity of the terminal is for 5 million tonnes a year, giving no timeline on when the facility would be built.

A Beijing Gas Group official reached by Reuters did not immediately comment. (Reporting by Chen Aizhu and Jessica Jaganathan; Editing by Tom Hogue)
