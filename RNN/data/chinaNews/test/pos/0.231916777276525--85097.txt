Once upon a time, Shangri-La was a fiction, a longed-for paradise of harmony and happiness. Invented by British writer James Hilton in the 1933 novel Lost Horizon, it was a mythic utopia, a blissful valley somewhere in Asia’s Kunlun Mountains, hidden in, yet apart from the world. It’s not inconceivable that such a place could have had a vineyard. In 2001, the Chinese government renamed Zhongdian County, a majority-Tibetan region, Shangri-La City in an attempt to promote tourism. For about the past five years, despite enormous obstacles of transportation and logistics, this Shangri-La does, in fact, have a winery.

The vineyards of Ao Yun—the name means “flying above the clouds” in Mandarin—rest on rock terraces 8,500 feet up in the Himalayas, in a remote part of China near where the Yangtze, Mekong and Salween rivers meet. For LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy), the luxury goods conglomerate that founded and owns the winery, Ao Yun has been as audacious as it has been costly and arduous. With China’s “consuming class” now numbering 1.2 billion and the world entering what consultancy McKinsey calls the “age of Asia,” Ao Yun may also prove to be an incredibly prescient venture for LVMH. It is certainly a very expensive gamble.

It’s not easy to visit Ao Yun. I arrived at Diqing/Shangri-La airport 40 hours and three flights after leaving my home in the Napa Valley. “Descend” doesn’t really describe what planes do in this remote corner of the Himalayas. Tossed around by air currents rebounding off the walls of glaciers and gorges, the plane finally jolted onto a small, high plateau that offered barely more than a sense of ground.

A man named Tashi, whom Ao Yun had arranged to drive me, was waiting. A Buddhist, Tashi had a cherubic face and curious earlobes that jutted perpendicularly from the sides of his head. He told me that his lama, or spiritual teacher, said that these were signs that Tashi had, in a former incarnation, been an important lama himself. All the workers at Ao Yun are Buddhist, Tashi explained. Because of this, they had “inner peace,” and under their care, the vineyards of Ao Yun were doing well.

The next morning, after some yak butter tea (the best method for keeping warm, Tashi insisted), we set off for Adong, the tiny village where Ao Yun is located. Until a new highway opened last year, this journey took eight hours, winding slowly between enormous yaks ambling along the narrow mountain paths. No words can describe the vertigo induced by these near-vertical “roads” of endless hairpin turns and thousand-foot drops on either side. Tashi said not to worry, no one ever gets injured in a car accident here. You’re either OK, or it’s your time.

LVMH’s first hire for the Ao Yun project was the famous Australian winemaker Tony Jordan. It was Jordan’s task to comb China’s 3.7 million square miles in search of a site that could yield grapes capable of resulting in a Chinese wine equal to a first-class Bordeaux. (Sadly, he died last August of cancer, at age 75). The goal: to create a domestic luxury product that would appeal to Chinese consumers. With one-third of production going to the U.S. and another third to France, LVMH is simultaneously trying to show the rest of the world that it can make a phenomenal new addition to the global pantheon of great wines. “It has always been in Moët Hennessy DNA to be one step ahead,” says Boris Janicek, managing director, estates and wines, the Moët Hennessy wine division.

When Jordan began his search, in 2008, a few very good wines, especially cabernet sauvignons, were already being made in China—notably in Ningxia, just south of Mongolia and the Gobi Desert in central China, as well as on Shandong Peninsula in northeastern China, immediately south of the Korean Peninsula, where Château Lafite Rothschild had bought land.
