KUALA LUMPUR: Low cost carrier AirAsia Bhd has launched new flights to Chengdu, the capital city of Sichuan Province, China for travellers flying out of Malaysiaâ€™s northern hub Penang.

These new three times weekly direct flights commencing 8 March 2020 will provide exclusive air connectivity between Penang to Sichuan Province.

"We are excited to announce our first new route of the new year, welcoming Visit Malaysia 2020 and in conjunction with Experience Penang 2020.

"Penang is one of our largest secondary hubs in Peninsular Malaysia, to which we have flown more than 2.4 million guests to the island last year.

"This is our first route from Penang to Mainland China and we are confident this additional route will continue to boost visitor arrivals into Penang, and vice versa," AirAsia Malaysia chief executive officer Riad Asmat said in a statement today.

Best known as home to the adorable giant pandas, Chengdu is a thriving city with plenty to do and taste.

With many natural, cultural and historical sights, some of the must-visit attractions include the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, Jinli Ancient Street and the Leshan Giant Buddha and Wenshu Monastery.

Named by UNESCO as a 'City of Gastronomy', many popular Chinese dishes such as Mapo Tofu and Kung Pao Chicken originate from the region.

Travellers can also choose to unwind by enjoying aromatic tea at any of the local teahouses.

Chengdu is also a gateway to the western territories of China, including Tibet, which its capital Lhasa is home to the historical center of Tibetan Buddhism and famous Potala Palace, as well as the Unesco World Heritage Site Jiuzhaigou, one of the most scenic places in China.
