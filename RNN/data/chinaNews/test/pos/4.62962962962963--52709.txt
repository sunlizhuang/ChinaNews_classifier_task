RIYADH: China has praised Saudi Arabia for its help in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, saying the Kingdom had offered “great moral and material support” in the wake of the health crisis.

“Since the outbreak of the epidemic, Saudi Arabia has been of great support to China,” Chen Weiqing, the Chinese ambassador to the Kingdom, told Arab News.

A Cabinet meeting last week chaired by King Salman expressed the Kingdom’s concern for China’s welfare, while Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan phoned his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi to reiterate the Kingdom’s support.

“I extend my appreciation and gratitude to King Salman, and the Saudi government and people,” the envoy said.

The Chinese ambassador said many countries, including Egypt, “offered us moral and material support to contain the coronavirus epidemic, and we are grateful for all forms of valuable support.”

Saudi Arabia flew 10 students from Wuhan, the center of the epidemic, back to Riyadh, with China “providing full support and facilitation,” according to the envoy.

“For those who decide to stay in China, we will spare no effort to safeguard the life and health of foreign nationals, including our Saudi friends, and take effective measures to address their concerns and needs in a timely manner,” Chen said.

“China has the confidence and ability to control the epidemic in the near future, with lower costs. We welcome our Saudi friends to China for education, business and tourism after the virus is contained. The outlook for the Chinese economy remains steady and positive, and China-Saudi cooperation will not to be affected in the long term.”

Preliminary tests on the 10 Saudi students showed no signs of viral infection.

The envoy said he planned to invite the students to the Chinese Embassy after their two-week quarantine was complete.
