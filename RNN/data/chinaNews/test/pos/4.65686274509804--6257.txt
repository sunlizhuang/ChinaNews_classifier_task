ISLAMABAD, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Through the handicrafts industry, Pakistan can not only boost its economy but also show the culture and portray the positive, colorful image of the country around the world, a Pakistani minister said on Sunday.

Pakistani Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Mohammad Azam Khan Swati made the remarks when addressing the Pakistan Craft Exhibition held at the Chinese embassy in Pakistan.

In order to further promote cultural exchanges between Pakistan and China, Pakistani artisans showcased a variety of unique handicrafts and other artistic products at the exhibition organized by the Handicrafts Association of Pakistan and the Chinese embassy.

"It is not the money that we are going to earn from this sector, but it is the impact of our culture, our tradition, our love, our affection that we are going to take from Pakistan to other countries," the minister said.

The participants took a keen interest in various handmade products such as embroidered clothes, rugs, carpets, jewelry, shoes, pottery, paintings and miniatures.

President of the handicrafts association Fahad Barlas told Xinhua that the aim of this exhibition is to directly connect the craftsmen to the international community through which they can further improve their craftsmanship and delicacy.

Hailing the efforts made by the Chinese side, Barlas said "the exhibition would help Pakistani craftsmen to introduce their work around the globe and establish their market linkages."

Barlas said his association is planning to showcase aesthetics and exquisite work of Pakistani artisans in China in the near future.

On the occasion, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Yao Jing said this exhibition gave people a glimpse of Pakistan's culture, its friendship, and the great hospitality shown by the people of the country.

"This is also an opportunity for us (Chinese people) to learn and to understand the rich culture of Pakistan," Yao said.

Rabia Fahran, who came from Rawalpindi city to display her handmade products at the event, told Xinhua that such platforms are much more suitable for artisans who do not have their big expensive outlets in main markets, or for people working at home, especially women who are not encouraged to work outside their homes on daily basis.

"They can bring their products here and would get more exposure as more people come to know about their products," Fahran said, adding that once they get orders from their customers, they can work at homes and deliver them.
