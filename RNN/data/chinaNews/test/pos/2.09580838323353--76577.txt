NEW: China Inn Closed in Pawtucket for Weeks, Owner Yip Says He Sold After 43 Years

Longtime Pawtucket dining establishment China Inn has sold.

Owner Louis Yip confirmed the development to GoLocalProv.com on Tuesday.

“I’m too old now,” said Yip, who noted he had run the restaurant now for over 43 years.

China Inn first opened in 1976 on Dexter Street in Central Falls. However, growth of the business demanded bigger and better facilities, which prompted the move and construction of the existing location, at 285 Main Street, in 1985, according to the restaurant’s website.

Well-known as a popular function space in the city, China Inn was especially known as a go-to spot as a fundraiser location for politicians.

A sign in the front door windows reads, "We are closed for vacation. Sorry for the inconvenience. - Management." The signs are faded from the sun and there is no activity anywhere near the front or the back of the building.

Yip has also had numerous real estate holdings in Pawtucket, inducing the building across the street.

“This restaurant has served the best Chinese food around since at least the 80s. Always high quality, totally consistent,” said one Yelp reviewer. “Some of the best dumplings I've had, and I have lived in New York City and Washington, DC. Sesame chicken is the best I've ever had. Nice place too - always lots of space and good parking. One of my absolute favorites.
