Tencent LiCaiTong Releases “Online Wealth Management Behavior and Security Report (2019)“

The report published the 2019 online wealth management index, presenting a comprehensive analysis of the market and consumer behavior during the past year.

According to the report, the overall market volume of online wealth management in China decreased from RMB 135.4 trillion in 2018 to RMB 129.7 billion in 2019. The downward trend was partially attributed to the stringent regulation towards money funds and p2p lending. The report recommends that investors should choose a platform that offers proper cybersecurity and customer protection, instead of just focusing on the high yield. (Source: mpaypass)
