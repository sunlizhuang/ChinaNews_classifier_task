Chinese president pays a state visit to Myanmar

Naypyidaw, Jan 17 (Prensa Latina) Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived today in this capital on an official visit to strengthen relations between China and Myanmar.

The two-day visit will also celebrate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, and it is believed that one of its objectives is to significantly boost China's profile and future investments in Myanmar.



According to statements by Chinese Ambassador in Myanmar, Chen Hai, during Xi Jinping's stay in the country, both countries will sign agreements 'that will cover politics, economy, livelihood, and regional cooperation.'



He confirmed that the Chinese president will meet with his counterpart Win Myint, State Councilor Suu Kyi, military chief Major General Min Aung Hlaing, legislators and opinion formers.



This trip is Xi Jinping's first visit abroad this year and the first visit to Myanmar as president, since Jiang Zemin was the last Chinese president to visit this country, when he signed several economic and border agreements in 2001.
