BEIJING, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities have called for stronger publicity to improve knowledge on epidemic prevention.

A circular, issued by the Communist Party of China's central civilization office, urges enhancing people's awareness of ecological conservation to respect nature and protect animals.

The circular also requires people to maintain a positive, optimistic, rational and peaceful state of mind to boost confidence in winning the battle against the epidemic.

Volunteers and voluntary service organizations should play a proactive role in publicizing the knowledge of epidemic prevention and control, said the circular, also calling for giving publicity to deeds of outstanding figures among medical personnel and primary-level cadres and people.
