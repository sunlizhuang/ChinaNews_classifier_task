Amid concerns over coronavirus, Philip Chong was asked if the Quincy Lunar New Year Festival would be cancelled.

“We talked to the commissioner of health…and checked with the CDC and the Department of Health, and the risk was low,” said Chong, CEO and president of festival organizer Quincy Asian Resources.

The Feb. 2 event went on as planned, and an estimated 3,800 attendees came, less than half the normal 10,000 in past years. Many visitors could be seen wearing masks, including Brendon Li. The North Quincy High School senior cited concerns over the first confirmed case of coronavirus in Massachusetts announced Feb. 1, the day before the festival.

“Everyone just wants to be safe because we’re all students who have to go to school tomorrow,” Li said.

Others brushed concerns aside.

“We always have this every year,” said Braintree High School student Vicky Zhang. “We’re not just gonna let like one little scare affect us, because we’re a pretty strong community. I think we’re good.”

April Yu, a cashier at the newly opened 99 Ranch Market in Quincy, said, “there’s fewer people this year, but it’s still a happy time and everyone’s into it.” She said as long as you take precautions like washing your hands and wearing a mask, there’s nothing to worry about.

Balloon artist Wendy Leahy said her son was currently in China. “I have no fear. I think it’s a lot of sensationalism, panic, worry. And I don’t subscribe to any of that,” Leahy said.

“We shouldn’t overreact,” said Quincy Mayor Thomas Koch. “I think the right decision was made to go forward with the program and obviously we got good crowds today and most people feel the same way.”

There were people who had some anxiety about the virus, including young siblings Reese and Kai McNeeley.

“There’s seven people in America that have it,” said Reese McNeeley. There were eight confirmed cases at the time of the festival. “But luckily we’re here and watching things that are very fun.”

Reese’s brother Kai added he didn’t want to talk about it. When asked why, he said, “it just kinda scares me a little bit.”

Instead, they wanted to talk about their favorite performance from the day, the lion dance.

Performed by Wah Lum Kung Fu and Tai Chi Academy, the lion dance featured a lion saving a rat from a snake.

“In lion dance routine,” Sifu Mai Du said during the performance, “it’s very traditional that if you have a killing of the snake it’s actually getting rid of an obstacle and getting rid of challenges for the new year.”

Du said everyone in the audience receives the blessing. So as it turns out, it may have paid off to come after all.
