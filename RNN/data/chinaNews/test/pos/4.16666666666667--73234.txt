Mongolia’s China Alumni Association and the Wuhan Alumni Association handed a donation totaling MNT 22 million to the Embassy of China in Ulaanbaatar for supporting the brave medics in Wuhan. The fund raising campaign was launched from January 23 with more than 3,000 people giving donations.

More than 10,000 Mongolian citizens have graduated from Chinese universities since 2016.

China’s new ambassador to Mongolia, H.E. Chai Wenrui said that the Government of Mongolia, its public organisations and individuals have been rendering tangible assistance to us. “Thousands of Chinese people thanked Mongolian people for their kindness and left comments on social media. They also pray, so that no one else will fall ill with this disease, Mongolians are among them.”
