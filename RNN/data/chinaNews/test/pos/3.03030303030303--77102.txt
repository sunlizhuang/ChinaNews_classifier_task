Scottish salmon exports in 2019 at record value of US$806 million

Scottish salmon exports in 2019 reached a record high at £618 million (US$805.55 million), up 22% over the previous year, according to new figures released by the UK government's Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs (HMRC), as reported by the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation (SSPO).

The tonnage exported also increased by 26% to over 94,000 tonnes.

France, the US and China were the top three markets out of 54 countries that imported Scottish salmon. For the third year running, France emerged as the largest market for Scottish salmon with purchases worth £221 million ($288.1 million), followed by the US (£179 million or $233.34 million), and China (£59 million or $76.9 million).

The EU accounted for 56% of the volume of global Scottish salmon exports and 52% of value.

Outside the EU, the US remained Scottish salmon's largest market, whose exports reached 25,000 tonnes.

Positive growth in 17 markets

Seventeen of the top 20 export markets showed positive growth in 2019.

While exports to China declined 11% in volume, these were offset by growth elsewhere in Asia such as Taiwan and Japan, resulting in almost £97 million ($126.36 million) worth of Scottish salmon exported to the region.

Julie Hesketh-Laird, Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation (SSPO) chief executive, said, "These figures demonstrate just what an extraordinary success Scottish salmon is. Such record-breaking performance is hugely encouraging and reflects the excellent reputation which Scottish salmon has in international markets".

She added that Scottish salmon, with its small carbon footprint and low water use, is recognised globally for its taste, quality and provenance.

Fergus Ewing, Scotland's rural economy secretary, welcomed the export figures, saying: "These record-breaking figures demonstrate that demand for Scottish salmon is soaring and highlights the world-class reputation our producers enjoy.
