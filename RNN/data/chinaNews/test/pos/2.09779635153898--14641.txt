The market for speciality fertilizers is projected to be valued at USD 52.4 billion by 2025. The Asia Pacific region accounted for the largest share in 2018 and is also projected to grow at the second-highest CAGR of 7.0% during the forecast period. Growth in the market can be attributed to the increasing demand for highly efficient fertilizers, favourable government regulations, increasing demand for high-value crops, and a rise in the number of investments from key players in this market.

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--The "Speciality Fertilizers Market by Type (UAN, CAN, MAP, Potassium Sulfate, and Potassium Nitrate), Application Method (Soil, Foliar, and Fertigation), Form (Dry and Liquid), Crop Type, Technology, and Region - Global Forecast to 2025" report has been added tooffering.

UAN is gaining more popularity among liquid fertilizers, as it can be mixed with pesticides, herbicides, growth regulators, and other nutrients, thereby allowing farmers to reduce costs. Solutions of UAN are widely used as a source of nitrogen for plant nutrition. These solutions are extremely versatile as a source of plant nutrition. Due to its chemical properties, UAN is compatible with many other nutrients and agricultural chemicals and is frequently mixed with solutions containing phosphorus, potassium, and other essential plant nutrients.

By technology, the speciality fertilizers market is segmented into slow-release, N-stabilizers, coated & encapsulated, and chelated. Coated & encapsulated speciality fertilizers are conventional soluble fertilizer materials with increasingly available nutrients, which after granulation, prilling, or crystallization, are given a protective (water-insoluble) coating to control the water penetration, thereby affecting the rate of dissolution and the nutrient release. The adoption of these fertilizers is increasing in the global market, particularly in China, the US, Japan, Canada, and Western Europe, due to the growing awareness about the benefits associated with coated fertilizers and government support provided by the nation, in terms of subsidies and policy amendments. Due to these factors, the segment is projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period.

According to the FAOSTAT, the Asia Pacific region contributed to more than 60% of the global population in 2017, with China and India being two of the most populous countries in the world. Hence, the increase in food demand from this region has led to a surge in the use of speciality fertilizers. The growth rate of the Japanese market is also projected to be high as compared to that of the other regions, due to the adoption of precise and advanced systems for farming, as well as controlled-environment agriculture. There are more global players in the market that are focusing on entering the Asia Pacific region through the adoption of strategies, such as mergers & acquisitions or partnerships. The Asia Pacific market is projected to grow at the highest rate due to the increase in demand from countries, such as India and China. The high cost of these fertilizers is a key factor inhibiting the growth of the Asia Pacific market.
