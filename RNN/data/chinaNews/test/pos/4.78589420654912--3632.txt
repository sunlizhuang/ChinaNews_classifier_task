Shanghai (Gasgoo)- CES, which descends on Las Vegas once a year, is where tech companies showcase to the world what achievements they have made and what they hope will be the next big technical breakthroughs.



At this year's CES, Chinese largest SUV and pickup manufacturer Great Wall Motor (GWM) announced a cemented cooperation with Neusoft, a Chinese leading IT-enabled solutions and services provider, to jointly develop a future-oriented in-car central computing platform based on the latter's self-built VCP (vehicle computing platform).



Adopting the idea of domain control, the platform will integrate the computing power and decision-making capability of ECUs (electronic control units), infotainment system, instrumental panel and body control system into a central computing unit, so as to balance the computing power among cloud, edge and devices. It is equivalent to adding to the auto system another CPUs which are able to swiftly take over the safety functions when the working CPU is in malfunction.



Using the special internal structure, the platform is design to enhance the disaster recovery and fault tolerance of vehicle electrical & electronic architecture for the sake of driving reliability, and boost the iteration of in-car hardware and software in a bid to improve users' driving experience.



According to a strategic cooperation agreement signed before the CES, both parties would join hands to develop in-vehicle computing platform, cloud services, big data and edge-cloud synergy, and deepen the intelligence level of cockpit by ameliorating software and hardware, helping GWM advance its capabilities in data fusion, intelligent decision-making and cooperative control.

The Baoding-based automaker has partnered with Huawei, China Mobile, NavInfo and Baidu to develop intelligent cockpit, which was much discussed by the industry last year due to its attribute to better display the value of a vehicle's internal space and the potential to generate more profits.

Neusoft, the 29-year-old IT-based solutions and service supplier, previously formed collaboration with GWM in fields such as in-vehicle infotainment system and T-Box.
