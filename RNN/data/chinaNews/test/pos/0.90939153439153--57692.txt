A state agency is reporting the first case of coronavirus in Wisconsin.

Health officials say the adult recently traveled to China. Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway says the person immediately went to UW Hospital in Madison for tests, after landing at the Madison airport.

State Health Officer Jeanne Ayers says the risk to the general public is very low.

Dr. Ryan Westergaard of the Department of Health Services says the person was not hospitalized, and is in isolation at home.

The state is waiting for test results from two other potential cases. Tests from seven other people came back clean.
