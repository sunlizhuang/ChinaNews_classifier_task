BEIJING: China stands ready to work with the international community to effectively curb the spread of the pneumonia cases caused by a new strain of coronavirus to uphold global health security, President Xi Jinping said.



Xi made the remark in telephone conversations with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of the Lunar New Year, which falls on Saturday.



Xi said since the outbreak of the contagion, China had made all-out efforts to prevent and control the disease, promptly disclose related information, and inform the World Health Organisation as well as relevant countries and regions about the disease in a timely manner.



Macron said his country supported China in dealing with the contagion and was willing to strengthen bilateral health cooperation.



Merkel said she appreciated China’s efforts to contain the spread of the contagious disease in a timely manner, adding that Beijing was open and transparent in developing international cooperation on the outbreak.



“Germany stands ready to provide support and assistance to China,” she added.



During telephone talks with European leaders, Xi stressed China’s commitment to further strengthen relations with the two countries as well as the European Union.



He underlined the need for Beijing and Paris to implement the consensus he and Macron reached on cooperation, take into account each other’s major concerns, and advance collaboration in such fields as civilian nuclear energy, science and technology and aerospace.



Xi said the Chinese market was open to the world and would continue to be open to France and Europe.



He called for strengthening communication and coordination between China and France on the reform of World Trade Organisation to move it in the right direction.



Noting that this year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the EU, Xi expressed the hope that both sides could reach a high-level investment agreement. — China Daily/ANN
