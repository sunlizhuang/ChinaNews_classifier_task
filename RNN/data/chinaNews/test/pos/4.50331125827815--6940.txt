Thailand's leading hospitality company; ONYX started 2020 with the announcement of a new property. The company signed a management agreement with Hangzhou East Bay Headquarters Base Construction Co. Ltd. to open China's second Amari hotel.

Located along the riverbank area of the Xiasha subdistrict, Amari East Bay Hangzhou will be a new landmark in the Qiantang New Area of Hangzhou. Hangzhou East Bay is in close proximity to the Qiantang River, neighbouring the industrial development zone. With the start of the city’s east expansion development strategy and the infrastructure of Greater Jiangdong, the area along the eastern border of Hangzhou is gradually being transformed into one of the city’s major districts. As one of the key infrastructures in the development zone, East Bay Headquarters Base will be home to enterprise headquarters, creative industries, commercial buildings, conference centres, a water park and walking streets. The headquarters building, in which Amari East Bay Hangzhou will be located, is situated in the Xiasha Wetland area, encompassing the interchangeable ring entrance in the south and sitting on more than 50 hectares of wetland landscape park where the most scenic views of the river can be enjoyed. The area will also play a major role in attracting investments, leading and driving the development of the region.

Scheduled to open in 2021, Amari East Bay Hangzhou will occupy levels 33 to 47 of the Hangzhou East Bay Headquarters Main Building, the tallest skyscraper in the Qiantang New Area. The lobby will be nestled on the 47th floor, approximately 200 metres from the ground, embracing a panoramic view of the Qiantang River and the riverbank wetland. Guests can enjoy an “amidst the clouds” experience in this tallest hotel in Qiantang New District.

Amari East Bay Hangzhou will feature 316 rooms that include guestrooms, executive suites and deluxe suites. A wide range of facilities, including an all-day dining outlet, a Chinese restaurant, lobby bar, executive lounge, multi-function room, fitness centre, swimming pool, kids club and Thai-inspired spa will be offered, providing a wide range of experiences for both business and leisure travellers. The hotel will combine a contemporary Thai-inspired design with touches reflecting the art and culture of Hangzhou, building a magnificent life gallery for a luxury sojourn.

Douglas Martell, President and Chief Executive Officer, ONYX Hospitality Group, said, “Amari East Bay Hangzhou will be our second Amari in China. As the flagship brand of ONYX Hospitality Group, Amari is a fast-expanding hotel and resort brand originated in Thailand with presence across Asian destinations such as the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Laos. It is our honour to partner with Hangzhou East Bay Base Construction Co. Ltd., in introducing a new flagship hotel that embodies the essence of the Amari brand, providing guests with a contemporary Thai experience in this dynamic city.”

Hangzhou East Bay Headquarters Base Construction Co., Ltd. expressed their optimism towards this deal. Upon completion, the Hangzhou East Bay Headquarters Base will become a national first-class facility, the province’s leading dual-core headquarters base, as well as a base for the Zhejiang business enterprise that emphasises 'pioneer and innovation'. The firm believes that, with the exceptional brand essence and the professional hotel management expertise and experience of ONYX Hospitality Group, the new Amari East Bay Hangzhou will shine as one of the most unique high-end business hotels in the region, which will help promote East Bay headquarters base in becoming the social and business hub of the area in the decades to come.

The Amari brand by ONYX Hospitality Group is a bright re-imagining of Thailand’s rich cultural roots, with each hotel in its portfolio highlighting the textures and flavours of its unique setting through architecture, design, cuisine and service, complemented by touches of contemporary Thai-ness. In recognition of its brand and service excellence, Amari was awarded the “Best Asian Style Hotel” at the 2018 Golden Pillow Awards of China Hotels. The past three years have been significant for the regional expansion of Amari, with the brand being launched at multiple new locations including Sri Lanka, Malaysia, China and Laos.

Based in Bangkok, ONYX Hospitality Group has a growing regional portfolio of 50 operating properties across three core brands in eight markets. The Group has a robust development pipeline of 25 new properties in markets such as China, Malaysia and Laos, and has set a target of having 99 hotels open by 2024 as part of its journey towards being the best medium-sized hospitality player in the region.
