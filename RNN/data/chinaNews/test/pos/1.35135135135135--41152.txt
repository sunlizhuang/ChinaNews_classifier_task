China has come forward to assist Britain in rescuing British Steel from oblivion, but Emmanuel Macron’s government has blocked any hope of a deal between London and Beijing being done. Sky News reports French finance minister Bruno Le Maire told Chancellor Sajid Javid they would not sign a deal to secure the firm’s rescue. The row comes the day Britain leaves the EU.

Mr Le Maire told Mr Javid there was “no way” the French would support the £50million sale of British Steel to a Chinese buyer. Mr Macron was reported to have supported the message passed onto the British Government, which came “with the blessing” of Paris. Turkish industrial investor Cengiz is also keen on the investment along with China.

Mr Macron will block the deal

Omer Mafa, chief executive of Cengiz, said he was "ready and waiting to engage" with the UK over the sale. He said: “Cengiz enjoys a strong trading relationship with French industries such as energy, mining and aviation.” Last April it emerged British Steel was in desperate need of £100million in a Government bail out loan after being frozen out by the EU.

The firm has been around for years

The company, which is Britain’s second biggest steel producer and supplies goods to Network Rail, is seeking an urgent loan for the eye-watering amount after former prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit debacle left the firm out of an EU-wide carbon trading scheme. British Steel, which employs 5,000 people, had been in crunch talks with Mrs May about securing the funds. A source close to the discussions rubbished claims the company’s Scunthorpe plant was on the brink of closure should talks about emergency funding collapse. DON'T MISS:

British Steel require a £100million loan

The source said: “There is no scenario where this creates uncertainty over Scunthorpe.” The 5,000 British Steel employees are directly responsible for a further 20,000 jobs. British Steel is struggling with its cash flow because of the EU not allocating UK-based companies their usual permits under its carbon emissions trading system (ETS), a scheme that prompts industrial polluters to pay for their previous year’s emissions.

The move came hours before Brexit
