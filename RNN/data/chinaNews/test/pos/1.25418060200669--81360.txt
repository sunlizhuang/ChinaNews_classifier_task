The increased adoption of NDIR gas analyzers can also be attributed to their ability to analyze multiple gases in harsh environments, the absence of cross-sensitivity, longer life spans, and the low cost of ownership.

On the other hand, ZR gas analyzers are mainly used to analyze oxygen concentration in clean rooms, biochemistry labs, and the food packaging industry, where the continuous measurement of flow gases is required.

- Further, increasing investments are being made in new plants, in the Asia-Pacific power, chemicals and petrochemicals, and oil and gas industries, which makes this region one of the fastest-growing regional markets.

- Further, technological advancements, such as wireless communication facilities and sensor technologies, are also expected to drive the market's growth. Due to their rugged nature and their ability to work in aggressive chemical environments, NDIR analyzers are preferred by the oil and gas and the chemicals and petrochemicals industries. They are also able to accept a certain degree of cross-sensitivity between different gases.

Scope of the Report

Gas analyzers are primarily used for quantitative purposes, to determine the concentration of gas and analyze physical parameters, such as temperature, pressure, concentration, and flow rate. Gas detectors are used for safety purposes, when the exact measurement is not critical. There are two types of gas analyzer: fixed & portable. They are segregated by technologies such as electrochemical, paramagnetic, zirconia (ZR), non-dispersive IR (NDIR). These are being used in oil and gas, chemical & petrochemical, water & wastewater, pharmaceutical, food & beverage.

Key Market Trends

Portable Gas Analyzer Technology to Hold Significant Share

Portable gas analyzers can be used in a real-time environment, for the detection of specific components and percentage of a particular component of a gas, in the surrounding area. These detectors are expected to grow, with the increasing mining activities, globally. For instance, Vale has opened the world's largest mining project for iron ore in Carajas, in the Brazilian Amazon region.

Portable gas analyzers are used to optimize the quantity of fuel flow rate, detection of harmful toxic gases, and the right composition of the mixture of gases that are necessary for the refining process, etc.

Recently, ABB implemented an ultraportable greenhouse gas analyzer (UGGA), for accurate measurements of methane, carbon dioxide, and water, in the Prudhoe Bay Oil field in Alaska.

In 2018, the fourth symposium on gas and coal market, International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Energy Forum (IEF) and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) focused on how the implementation of measures to meet the climate change mitigation would affect demand for coal and for natural gas. So the use of different gas analyzer technologies such as non-dispersive IR (NDIR), portable gas analyzer solutions needed to decarbonize energy systems.

Asia-Pacific Region is Expected to Witness a Significant CAGR

- Asia-Pacific is the only region to register a capacity growth in the oil and gas industry, in recent years. About four new refineries were added in the region, which has added about 750,000 barrels per day, to the global crude oil production.

- The development of industries in the region is driving the growth of portable gas analyzers, owing to their advantages in the oil and gas industry, such as monitoring processes, increased safety, enhanced efficiency, and quality.

- Moreover, China is focused on becoming the world leader in emission reduction and has completely adopted a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) as the required post-combustion NOx control process, for all large power plants.

- The increase in the demand for low-cost, high-precision products across developing countries, such as India, Malaysia, etc., is expected to boost the market's growth. Further, the increased enforcement of regulations from countries, such as China, Japan, and South Korea, has encouraged companies to invest in sophisticated gas analyzers. Thus, end-user companies are willing to invest in safety systems, rather than facing disasters.

Competitive Landscape

The gas analyzer market is fragmented. Mostly, increased R&D efforts, new technologies, such as TDLA (tunable diode laser), increased adoption of NDIR gas analyzers, the decline in oil prices, across regions, provides lucrative opportunities in the gas analyzer market. Overall, the competitive rivalry among existing competitors is high. Moving forward, the product innovation strategy of large companies is penetrating the market growth. Some of the key players in the market are ABB, Honeywell International Inc., and Emerson. Some of the key developments in the area are:

- March 2019 - Emerson signed multiple contracts totaling USD 12 million with India's largest commercial oil company, Indian Oil Corporation Limited, to modernize operations and emissions programs at the company's refineries. To help IndianOil reach its goals, Emerson will install advanced technologies, including DeltaVTM distributed control systems, DeltaV safety instrumented systems, and AMS asset management software, wired field instruments including pressure, temperature and flow sensors to control and isolation valves.
