Beijing has slammed senior officials from the United States, Britain and Japan for congratulating Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen after her landslide election victory.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters on Sunday that Beijing urged the international community to continue adhering to the “One-China principle”.

“We hope and believe that … (they will) understand and support the just cause of Chinese people to oppose the secessionist activities for ‘Taiwan independence’ and realise national reunification,” he said.

Ms Tsai, of the Democratic Progressive Party, was re-elected over the weekend with some 57 per cent of the popular vote, while Beijing-friendly rival Han Kuo-yu from the opposition party Kuomintang received just 39 per cent.

In a statement on Twitter, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo congratulated Ms Tsai for her re-election and the self-ruling island’s democratic election system.

“Taiwan once again demonstrates the strength of its robust democratic system,” Mr Pompeo tweeted.

“Thank you President Tsai for your leadership in developing a strong US partnership.”

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden also extended his congratulations to Ms Tsai on Twitter, saying “you are stronger because of your free and open society”.

“The United States should continue strengthening our ties with Taiwan and other like-minded democracies,” he wrote.

Meeting with the de facto US ambassador to Taipei, William Brent Christensen, a day after the election, Ms Tsai said: “Taiwan’s people once again use the vote in their hands to show the world the value of democracy.”

Responding to questions about the congratulatory messages on Sunday, Mr Geng told reporters the election in Taiwan was “a local affair in China” and reprimanded the countries for violating the One-China principle.

The One-China principle states there is only one China, and Taiwan is seen as a renegade province.

“China expresses its strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to (the congratulatory messages) and has made solemn representations to the countries concerned,” Mr Geng was quoted by state media Xinhua as saying.

“We oppose any form of official exchanges between Taiwan and countries who have diplomatic ties with China.

“It is hoped that the countries concerned will earnestly abide by the One-China principle, not develop any official relations and conduct any official exchanges with Taiwan, handle Taiwan-related issues prudently and properly, not send any wrong signals to ‘Taiwan pro-independence’ forces.”
