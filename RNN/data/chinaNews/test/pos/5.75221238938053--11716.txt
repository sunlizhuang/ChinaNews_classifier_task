NAY PYI TAW, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and China are good neighbors sharing a long border line, and the two sides will develop their relations through stronger cooperation, Myanmar's top lawmaker has said.

Speaker of the Union Parliament and Speaker of the House of Representatives U T Khun Myat made the remarks in a recent interview with Xinhua ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping's upcoming visit to Myanmar.

"I am happy to know that Chinese President Xi Jinping will pay a state visit to Myanmar at the invitation of Myanmar President U Win Myint," he said, adding that the Union Parliament welcomes Xi's visit.

"The visit of the Chinese president has a significant meaning. It shows to the world that Myanmar has good neighbors and partners," he noted.

The legislatures of the two countries have maintained close communication and exchanges since Myanmar's Union Parliament was established in 2011, said the speaker.

"Chinese lawmaking experts came to share knowledge and experience with us," he said. "We also came to visit China at the invitation of our Chinese counterparts."

"Myanmar and China have shared a long border line, and had a good relationship in history," he said.

Xi's visit will strengthen Myanmar-China relations, which "will further develop with more and more cooperation," the speaker said.
