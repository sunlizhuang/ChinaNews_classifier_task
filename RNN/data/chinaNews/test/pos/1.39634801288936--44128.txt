LEXINGTON - The furnace roared hotter than a volcano as Dustin Parrella grasped a glowing blade with his blacksmith's tongs.

"It's very important to forge in low light so that you can see it," Parrella said, sparks flying as he hammered the dagger. "They say strike while the iron's hot, and that's because if you let it get too cool, it could crack."

It's a set of skills the Lexington resident recently used while competing on the History Channel's show "Forged in Fire." His episode airs 9 p.m. Wednesday.

"Whether or not I made it to the second round or not is to be determined," he said, making sure not to give away any secrets.

Parrella graduated a Minuteman in 2007, and still lives on the same block where he grew up. It didn't take long for him to take a union job with Ironworkers Local 550 out of Canton. Over the years, the hall has asked him to repair furnaces in steel mills, structurally reinforce steel cell towers so that more carriers could be added and even connect structural beams in buildings with giant bolts and his welder.

After nearly a decade working in the steel industry, Parrella learned quite a lot about how buildings were made a century ago. Older coworkers passed down stories to him about the blacksmiths who used to toss glowing-hot iron rivets up to steelworkers who would hammer them into place on projects like the Empire State Building, securing the foundations for the dozens of floors above.

"It struck an interest in seeing what people in my profession did in the past," Parrella said.

So, four years ago, he finally decided to study to become a blacksmith. His tools were simple at first and his projects primitive: He made utensils for campfires and tinkered with heating and forging different types of metals. He soon realized he was far more advanced than most beginners.

"I have been welding and working with metal ever since I was a little kid," Parrella admitted.

His job as a steelworker helped flame his hobby as a blacksmith. He continued studying metallurgy, and learned which metals should be used at different points during a project.

Parrella eventually started making knives, layering different types of steel throughout, with the hardest near the cutting edge. Once complete, he refines them even further with a series of sanding stones, as well as a belt sander.

Simple projects can take half a day, but others almost a week. When he gets near the end of a piece, Parrella becomes even more cautious with his hammer. Once he struck a blade too hard after 15 hours of forging.

"Then it ended up in the scrap bucket," he said.

By spring of 2019, Parrella decided that although he was still new at forging, he wasn't exactly inexperienced, so he applied to become a participant on one of his favorite shows: "Forged in Fire."

"First I had to go through a series of phone interviews," he said.

Then, they sent him dimensions and specification for a small blade they wanted him to make.

"I had to document it," he said.

After a couple months, Parrella got a call from the History Channel â€” they wanted to fly him to New York to compete on the show.

"I had to keep my mouth shut at that point," he said. "It was pretty hard to keep quiet."

He competed against three others in a forge hotter than any he's ever felt. Each of the contestants forged their own Japanese nata, which is a long knife similar to a machete.

Judges kept three of the contestants for a second round, then only two for the final round. The past few months have been hard for Parrella, because he hasn't been able to tell any of his friends about how Wednesday's show might end. But he could say that he enjoyed every part of the experience.

"Luckily for me, I got along with all three of my competitors," Parrella said. "I still talk to them. I left with three new friends."

Since returning home, he's started a new company that he calls Blue Collar Forge. He makes knives and tools and just about anything his clients want.

"I'm hoping for this to turn into a full-time job," Parrella said.

Until then, he's just waiting for Wednesday night when he can take his 4-year-old son, Dominic, down to The Local at 97, a restaurant owned by his friend, Lou Sorrenti. The entire venue will be transformed into a giant watch party for Parrella's episode of Forged in Fire.

To match the occasion, Sorrenti is selling several special medieval dishes in hopes the Lexington native wins the contest, and the $10,000 prize that goes with it.

"I want everyone to have fun," Sorrenti said. "We're excited about it."

Even if he doesn't win, Parrella has had fun. He's expanded his hobby into a potential new career, and had the chance to be filmed for a show that will be broadcast nationwide. And young Dominic now has his own tiny forge that he uses to help dad with smaller projects.

"Hopefully some more kids will see this and they will get interested," Parrella said. "I'd be happy to show them the ropes and help them learn a little more about it."
