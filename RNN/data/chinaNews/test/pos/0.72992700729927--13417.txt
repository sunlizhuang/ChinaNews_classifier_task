The tour operator collapsed in September and was acquired by Fosun Tourism Group

Thomas Cook is to be reborn as an online travel agent under plans drawn up by the Chinese group that acquired it.

Fosun Tourism Group, the travel group’s biggest shareholder until its collapse in September, is understood to have hired a dozen former Thomas Cook executives, most of them with a technology background, with a view to relaunching the brand in June.

It appointed Alan French, formerly group strategy and technology director, as chief executive, with Raj Sharma, a former finance executive, joining as chief financial officer and Phil Gardner, erstwhile head of sales, ecommerce and marketing, as head of marketing.

Fosun, which led an abortive £1.1 billion rescue deal for Thomas Cook, is said to be keen to quickly re-establish the 179-year-old tour operator
