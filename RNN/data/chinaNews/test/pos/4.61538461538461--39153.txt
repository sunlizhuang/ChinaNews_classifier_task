CANTON – Traditional Arts in Upstate New York – TAUNY -- has welcomed two new members to its Board of Directors, Kate Newell of Canton and William Holland of Pierrepont.

Kate Newell, a native of St. Lawrence County, currently makes her home in Canton. She is a former elementary school teacher, has served on numerous North Country community boards, and is a co-founder of the Sweetgrass Foundation. She’s been involved with TAUNY since the beginning and continues to be a strong supporter of the organization.

William Holland, Pierrepont, is a staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society of Northeastern New York in Canton. He moved to the North Country from New York City with his wife after she accepted a professorship at SLU. He grew up in rural Minnesota, a place similar in many ways to St. Lawrence County. His first time at TAUNY was spent painting a barn quilt in the lower level, and he looks forward to becoming more involved.

The TAUNY Center, 53 Main St., is the home of the non-profit organization dedicated to helping people understand and appreciate the folk traditions and local culture of everyday life -- present and past -- in the North Country. To do so, TAUNY seeks to research and preserve a record of diverse groups, customs and traditions; to recognize and empower traditional arts and artists; to identify and promote regional identity; and to provide opportunities for people of all ages to learn about folklore and culture.
