CORONAVIRUS | A team of six Malaysian embassy officials arrived safely in Wuhan where they are to help coordinate the process of bringing back 120 Malaysians from Hubei province, the epicentre of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak which has now claimed 304 lives.

It is understood that the team arrived at about 3.30am today after travelling for almost 13 hours.

Malaysia's ambassador to Beijing, Raja Nushirwan Zainal Abidin told Astro Awani that the team was not able to provide any further updates as it was early morning.

The team of six embassy officials was assigned to compile and update the list of Malaysians in the region.

The team will also work with local authorities to streamline the repatriation process.

Those involved are expected to return with commercial flights soon, possibly as early as tomorrow.

However, this has yet to be confirmed as Nushirwan also said details of the return date would be announced by the Malaysian government once it reaches an agreement with the Chinese government on the matter.
