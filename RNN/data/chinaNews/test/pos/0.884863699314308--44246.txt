Test results show that there are no cases of the coronavirus on Miami University’s campus in Oxford, according to the Ohio Department of Health.

Further, no coronavirus cases have been detected in the entire state of Ohio.

The students who were in isolation were released a few hours before the results of the possible cases were disclosed.

The university declined to reveal the name or gender of the students who were tested for the virus.

Butler County General Health District officials met with Miami University’s Student Health Services with concerns about a possibility of coronavirus being detected on the Oxford campus.

On Monday two Miami students who had traveled to China complained of flu-like symptoms to health services staff. It was the first day back for students after a six-week break between semesters.

An outbreak of the virus in China was reported in December.

The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services declared a public health emergency on Friday, Jan. 31, and the CDC issued quarantine orders to all 195 United States citizens who repatriated to the country on Wednesday, Jan. 29.
