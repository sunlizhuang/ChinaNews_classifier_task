The coronavirus scare has not been able to deter two Chinese car makers from launching their models at the auto expo.

Though the top management of Haima Automobile and Great Wall Motors could not be present at the expo because of travel restrictions, officials from the companies, both Chinese and non-Chinese, were present at the event to showcase their products.

Great Wall Motors (GWM) on Wednesday said it will invest $1 billion in India. The company has set up an engineering and R&D centre in Bangalore. It has also inked an agreement to acquire GM’s plant in Talegaon.

The company on Wednesday unveiled the pure electric Concept SUV Haval Vision and the Concept H Plug-in hybrid.

“We will launch our first model in 2021 which will be an SUV,” Hardeep Singh Brar, director (sales and marketing) of Great Wall Motors, said.

Haima Automobile, part of Haima Group, showcased two of its passenger vehicles — the 7X and 8S — at the expo.
