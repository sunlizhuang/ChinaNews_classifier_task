Beijing ‘touched by Pakistan’s trust’

BEIJING: China on Monday expressed gratitude and appreciation to the Pakistani leadership for extending a firm support to Beijing in the fight against novel coronavirus epidemic, saying it was deeply grateful and touched by such trust and confidence.

“As China fights the outbreak, Pakistan has stood firmly with us, maintaining flights and pooling medical supplies all over the country to help China. We are deeplygrateful and touched by such trust and confidence,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said during the first “online” briefing held here. The briefing resumed after the Chinese New Year and Spring Festival holidays.

She remarked China and Pakistan were iron-clad friends that share a good tradition of mutual assistance, saying: “China will continue to work in close communication and coordination with Pakistan to safeguard the health of Pakistanis in China”.

Referring to the statements of Prime Minister Imran Khan and Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi regarding China’s fight against novel coronavirus, she said: “Indeed, the Pakistani Prime Minister and Foreign Minister highly commend and firmly support China’s efforts to fight against the new coronavirus”.

She added: “They also appreciate China’s assistance for Pakistani citizens in China and express confidence in China winning this battle with the strength of its system. The Pakistani people are standing firmly with their Chinese brethren.”

Chunying pointed out that like Pakistan, many other countries had also expressed full confidence in China, adding: “We thank them. We have the confidence and the capability to win the fight against the outbreak as soon as possible and safeguard the life and health of their citizens in China”.

About the medical supplies from Pakistan and some other countries, she said since the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak, some countries had expressed understanding and support to China through various means. The spokesperson said at present the Chinese side urgently needed medical masks, protective suits and safety goggles.

She informed that the US government had not provided any substantial assistance to China, but it was the first to evacuate personnel from its consulate in Wuhan, the first to suggest partial withdrawal of its embassy staff, and the first to impose a travel ban on Chinese travellers. “All it has done could only create and spread fear,” she remarked.

The spokesperson hoped the international community could view the epidemic in a rational and calm way and make a science-based and measured response. The spokesperson said in an open, transparent and highly responsible attitude, China would enhance cooperation with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the international community. The spokesperson went online and used WeChat to answer questions from journalists.
