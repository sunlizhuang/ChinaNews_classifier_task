(Ecofin Agency) - Morocco will soon upgrade to the 5G network. Philippe Wang, Vice President of Huawei North Africa, announced on January 21 that the company is ready to collaborate with Moroccan operators in deploying the technology.

Huawei says this will be a step forward for Morocco in achieving its digital transformation ambition including becoming a technological hub on the continent. The Chinese company is already supporting eight Moroccan universities for the training of 12,000 students in the ICT field over a period of three years. It is also helping the public administration to digitalize services.

Huawei sees Morocco as a market with high potential, enjoying political stability, appreciable economic development, a fairly well-supplied infrastructure, and qualified human resources. These assets have also prevailed in the choice of the country to host Huaweiâ€™s regional center for North Africa.
