Apparently, launching subsidiary brands is the way to go for most Chinese smartphone makers nowadays. It’s a strategy that definitively is proving to be a smart one. If we take Realme’s as an example, the brand started as Oppo’s subsidiary in India in 2018 and quickly turned into the fastest-growing smartphone brand in the world. Now, Realme is nearly an independent company sharing some resources with its mother Oppo. According to a new report, Vivo will follow Oppo’s steps by launching iQOO in India as an independent brand.

Vivo achieved satisfactory results with the gaming-centric iQOO sub-brand in China during the last year. Now, the Chinese firm is ready to leave the domestic market diving directly in the super-competitive market of India. Until the moment, the iQOO lineup serves as Vivo’s gaming smartphone range with an intensive focus in high-end specs combined with an affordable price point. The brand already gave birth to 6 devices with the most recent one being the iQOO Neo 855 Racing. The portfolio will soon get new members with the reports of a new Vivo iQOO 3 and 3 Neo debuting in the near future.

The race in the Indian market will be intense throughout the course of this year. Along with Vivo’s iQOO, the Indian market will have Realme and Xiaomi’s Redmi and Poco sub-brands. These brands will fight for the Indian customer’s preference. We expect to see the iQOO presence at Mobile World Congress 2020 in the next month. It will be a perfect opportunity for the company to disclose details about its International campaign.
