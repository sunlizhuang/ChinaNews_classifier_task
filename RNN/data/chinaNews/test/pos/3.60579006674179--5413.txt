ST Edward’s School in Oxford has a new Bursar who once held a range of high-profile roles in the Royal Navy and also worked for Princess Anne.

Edward Hayter joined the private school in Woodstock Road known as Teddies at the start of the year.

He qualified as a Navigating Officer in the Royal Navy after graduating and saw service worldwide in the surface fleet.

In 1996 he was appointed Aide-de-Camp to HRH the Princess Royal and left the Navy in 1998.

Mr Hayter, who lives in Oxford, and is also chief operating officer, said: “I’m looking forward to working closely with the governors, the Warden, other senior management team colleagues and all the staff at St Edward’s to help drive the continued success and growth of this great school.

St Edward’s Warden Stephen Jones added: “We are thrilled to have Edward working with us. He has an extremely distinguished background and wide-ranging experience which will bring huge benefits to St Edward’s. We extend a very warm welcome to Edward and his family.”

My Hayter's first priority will be to oversee the completion of the current programme of expansion at the School.

He said: “Education is changing and St Edward’s is growing – we are currently investing in our built environment to ensure that our pupils have the very best facilities in which to live and learn.”

At the same time, Mr Hayter will be looking to extend access to the school to as many young people as possible by reviewing the number of free or discounted places available.
