A total of nine foreign workers from China recently arrived in Manokwari, West Papua, are being monitored by local officials in regard to their health – in anticipation of the spread of the coronavirus to Indonesia.

West Papua Health Agency head Otto Parorongan said the nine foreign workers were working at cement company PT SDIC Papua Cement Indonesia and had gone through a series of tests upon entering Manokwari.

“Six of them arrived on Wednesday and the rest arrived on Thursday. Together with the West Papua Manpower Agency, the Manokwari Immigration Office and the Health Office at the Manokwari Port, we went to the company and directly conducted a health examination,” Otto said on Friday, as quoted by Antara news agency.

The results of the examination showed that all of them were in good health, Otto said. Their body temperatures ranged from 31.6 to 31.7 degrees Celsius and they did not show any symptoms of coughing, colds or sore throats.

“Before that, they were also examined when they arrived at Rendani Airport in Manokwari and were declared healthy,” Otto said.

Despite having been tested, Otto said the Manokwari Health Agency would monitor the workers for up to 14 days from the time they left China.

“We’ve asked the management of PT SDIC to proactively report every arrival of foreign workers,” he said.

As preventive measures, Otto said that every Chinese worker who had just arrived was required to follow the 14-day incubation period and was prohibited from having direct contact with other employees.

“Masks, disinfectants and temperature gauges are provided in each incubation room,” he said. (syk)
