Alaska pollock industry officials explore export market potential in China

A group of Alaska pollock industry officials arrived earlier this week in Shanghai for a 10-day visit to China as an exploratory trip to appraise opportunities in the country, according to a Genuine Alaska Pollock Producers (GAPP) press release.

The tour, sponsored in large part by a grant from the Emerging Market Department of the United States Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service, will also include stops in Qingdao and Beijing.

“China is a critically important export market for wild Alaska pollock and we’re eager to explore the market further and fully understand this market’s challenges and opportunities,” GAPP Chief Executive Officer Craig Morris said. “These eight leaders represent various sectors of the industry and will help be our eyes and ears on the ground to report back actionable insights that can benefit the entire industry.”

The industry members, representing companies such as Trident Seafoods, American Seafoods, Golden Alaska Seafoods, Arctic Storm Holding Company, and the Central Bering Sea Fishermen’s Association, plan to meet with Chinese seafood industry leaders and hope to explore future possibilities for collaboration.

In Shanghai, their exploration of the Chinese market will take them from places as large and internationally renowned as Sam’s Club and Costco, to traditional wet markets.

In Qingdao, the delegation will discuss fish sausage processing and explore new ways for the Chinese market to incorporate surimi. In Beijing, the group will have meetings with members of the American embassy as well as other potential retailers.

“The goals of this journey are simple: to continue to cement our current customer relationships in China and explore exciting new opportunities for collaboration,” said Morris. “With disease outbreaks and shifting protein demands, China is looking for new options for its consumers – and wild Alaskan pollock is perfectly positioned to capitalize on growing protein demand.”
