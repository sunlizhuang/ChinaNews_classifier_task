IQ-EQ has expanded its Luxembourg senior team with the appointment of Bram Eijsbouts as its new head of business development.

The new appointment marks a newly created position, which IQ-EQ said reflects the increasing market opportunity identified in the sector, both in Luxembourg and more broadly across the global group.

In the new role, Eijsbouts will report directly to Fèmy Mouftaou, IQ-EQ Luxembourg’s chief commercial director.

Eijsbouts brings with him 17 years of experience in the financial and corporate services sector, and his commercial experience includes senior roles with a global investor services group.

Most recently, Eijsbouts served as its commercial director and head of sales, where he was responsible for driving top-line growth and maximising the inflow of new clients across the corporate and funds segments.

Prior to this, he was business development director in Hong Kong and head of greater China outbound sales, where he was responsible for strategic client and business partner relationships as well as leading the commercial strategy for the region.

His career also includes several senior positions with a Dutch/Belgian financial business active globally in commercial and corporate banking and investment management, IQ-EQ noted.

As well as this new hire, IQ-EQ also recently appointed a new London-based associate director of business development.

Amidst the new appointments, IQ-EQ also very recently signed a deal with Microgen and Touchstone who recently completed their merger.

As the merger completes,IQ-EQ signed an agreement to extend their relationship to use the software across all its global offices.

Eijsbouts noted that he has been watching the rise of IQ-EQ recently and really liked the positive change he was seeing.

“Their dual focus of investing in people as well as developing innovative quality solutions for their strong global client base resonates with me personally and presents me with the perfect environment to put my extensive commercial experience into practice,” Eijsbouts said.

“Luxembourg, a well regulated and growing financial centre, together with IQ-EQ’s strong service offering and growth ambitions make this an extremely appealing proposition. I’m looking forward to playing my part in its future success,” he added.

Christian Heinen, managing director, Luxembourg commented: “Following a series of key industry hires in 2019 I’m delighted to kick start 2020 with the announcement of further investment in the strength and depth of our sector expertise.”

Heinen continued: “IQ-EQ is on a fast and exciting trajectory for change and is consistently showcasing itself, particularly here in Luxembourg, as a force to be reckoned with in the industry. It’s an exciting time to be part of this business and I’m delighted that Bram Eijsbouts has decided to join us.”
