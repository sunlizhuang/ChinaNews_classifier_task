MANILAâ€”It was that time of year, when local celebrities come out in full force trying to make the most romantic and grandest of gestures for their dearest loved ones.

Xian Lim certainly did for this year's Valentine's Day, surprising Kim Chiu with a huge bouquet of roses that's as tall as he is.

Making sure that his girlfriend felt loved this Friday, Lim prepared the towering gift, which, as seen in a video posted online, required three men, including himself, to carry.

"Each year you never fail to surprise me!" Chiu wrote, as she shared a photo of her hugging the bouquet on Instagram. "Thank you for putting such effort . . . Babae pala ako!"

Lim and Chiu have been dating since 2012. In a recent interview, they were asked about if they have marriage plans and answered that the key to a happy relationship is to not to rush things.

The two are currently starring in the new afternoon series, "Love Thy Woman," with Yam Concepcion.
