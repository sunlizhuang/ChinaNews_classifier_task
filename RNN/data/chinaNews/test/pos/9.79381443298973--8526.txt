ULAN BATOR, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- A cultural event entitled "Happy Chinese New Year" to celebrate the upcoming Chinese Spring Festival or Lunar New Year was held here on Tuesday night.

The event started with a short video called "Beautiful China-Blissful Holiday" that presented New Year blessings, followed by singing and dancing performed by Mongolian artists.

In his speech at the event, Yang Qingdong, charge d'affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia, said "China and Mongolia are good friends and good neighbors."

"In recent years, relations and cooperation between our two countries have been developing rapidly in a wide range of areas, especially culture and tourism," Yang added.

Noting that Mongolians will soon celebrate the Lunar New Year, also known as the White Moon, he wished the two peoples good health and happiness.

In addition, a photo exhibition showcasing the beauty and development of China also opened during the event co-organized by the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia and the Chinese Cultural Center in Ulan Bator.
