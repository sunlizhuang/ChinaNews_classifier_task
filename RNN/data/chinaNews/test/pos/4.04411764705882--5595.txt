Earlier, Li said the troupe had become one of the most popular art troupes in China and have greater influence in the world.

“I can tell you that five years ago, I worked as the Cultural Attache in the Trinidad and Tobago, a very beautiful island country in the Caribbean sea.

“And at that time, the troupe visited there and they performed. I still remember, in the pitfall around a bigger Savannah. They gave very impressive and an amazing performance. The local people kept them warmly welcome,” Li stated.
