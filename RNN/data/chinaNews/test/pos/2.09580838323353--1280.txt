Shanghai (Gasgoo)- Jetour, Chery Holding’s sub-brand, announced its 2019 sales totaled 138,032 units, while the sales in December stood at 20,007 units, up by 46.6% year on year.

The brand has sold 178,039 vehicles in 16 months since the launch of its first model, the X70, in 2018 August. The X70, boasting two variants, contributes 90% of the total sales with over 120,000 units sold in the whole year of 2019. At Jetour’s year-end communication meeting, Li Xueyong, general manager of the brand’s marketing center, said the brand targets 20,000-unit monthly sales and 200,000 units in 2020.

To achieve the target, the Chery-owned brand will expand its product lineup. It is expected to roll out five midsize SUV models—the X70 Coupe, the X79M, the new X70S, the 2020 X90 and the 2020 X95. Besides, Jetour has deployed more than 1800 shops, including 403 smart showrooms, to acquire and maintain the attention from customers. Taking advantage of its competitive features and price, the brand commits itself to gaining market share in the second- and third-tier cities or towns with dense population.

At the beginning of 2019, ten China’s authorities jointly issued a plan for a steady growth in consumption and the auto consumption is a priority. One suggestion for it is “bringing autos to the countryside”. In response to the policy, apart from Jetour, independent brands such as SAIC Roewe, FAW Besturn and Haval, and joint ventures like SAIC Volkswagen, FAW-Volkswagen, Dongfeng Nissan and Changan Mazda have entered the markets in cities below the third tier and rural areas. According to Jetour's official website, it will also offer price discounts for customers returning to their hometown (photo source: Jetour's WeChat account).
