Assemblywoman Cottie Petrie-Norris (AD-74) has issued the following statement regarding the potential use of Costa Mesa’s Fairview Developmental Center as a treatment center for COVID-19 patients being transferred out of Travis Airforce Base (AFB).

“My number one priority is the health and safety of our community,” said Petrie-Norris. “We recently learned that the federal government is evaluating a number of potential secondary sites for COVID-19 patients, including the Fairview Developmental Center in Costa Mesa. Given its proximity to a densely populated urban community, I object strongly to the Fairview Developmental Center being selected by federal authorities for this purpose. We urge federal authorities to designate a more appropriate site.”

“Furthermore, I call on federal authorities to provide clarity to local officials on all public health and safety plans regarding the proposed transfer and treatment of these patients. It is important that we as a community have answers, to ensure public health and public peace of mind. Considering misinformation around COVID-19 continues to be disseminated at a rapid rate – federal and local authorities must be on the same page on actions going forward.”

“I also look forward to continuing to work with local health authorities like OC Health, to ensure that information and resources are available to keep our communities safe.”

Additional points regarding COVID-19 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:

Imported cases of COVID-19 in travelers have been detected in the U.S. Person-to-person spread of COVID-19 also has been seen among close contacts of returned travelers from Wuhan, but at this time, this virus is NOT currently spreading in the community in the United States.

For the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low at this time.

And some general recommendations from the CDC: It’s currently flu and respiratory disease season and CDC recommends getting a flu vaccine, taking everyday preventive actions to help stop the spread of germs, and taking flu antivirals if prescribed.

If you have been in China or have been exposed to someone sick with COVID-19 in the last 14 days, you will face some limitations on your movement and activity. Please follow instructions during this time. Your cooperation is integral to the ongoing public health response to try to slow spread of this virus.
