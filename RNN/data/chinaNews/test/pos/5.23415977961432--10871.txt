New York City, Paris, London, Tokyo and Shanghai are five of the world’s largest cities, centers of culture that dictate trends and taste, so Nike is saluting the people that make these metropolises move with a special Air Max 90 “City Pack.” Celebrating the silhouette’s 30th anniversary by acknowledging the urban locales that made it iconic, all five of these Air Max 90s boast re-crafted uppers and a smattering of special details on tongues, lace tips, sockliners and mudguard logos. The inspiration doesn’t stop there either: each nods to a profession that’s intertwined with its respective municipality.

New York City’s pair celebrates the Big Apple’s brave firefighters with a reflective yellow Swoosh inspired by flame-retardant uniforms. The heel emblems take things a step further with silver screw-attached detailing and a bold “90” stamp on the left shoe for a nod to classic fire helmets.

Paris’s pair acknowledges the French capital city’s artisanal bakers, equipping an all white upper for a nod to their work garb. Royal crests appear on the heel, while the insole offers a wheat graphic with a clever “Baked Fresh Daily” hit.

London’s pair is an acknowledgement of the Big Smoke’s postmen and postwomen, directly referencing their uniforms with a red and orange upper. A signature detail is provided by a stamp-inspired round tongue with a picture of Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman‘s face.

Tokyo’s pair draws from the city’s omnipresent construction workers, with a rich navy/gold colorway and a workmanlike gum sole. The alternating tongue badges nod to construction site signs, and the insole graphic presents Tokyo’s cityscape.

Last but not least, Shanghai’s pair is inspired by the hustle and bustle of food delivery service workers. Details include a receipt on the tongue tab and a five-star mudguard underlay, nodding to a perfect review for exemplary service.

The Nike Air Max 90 “City Pack” will see a members-exclusive release on the Nike webstore come January 30. Select doors in each city will also carry the special designs.

Moving from the streets to the track, Nike’s ultra-futuristic ZoomX Vaporfly NEXT% has released in a “Blue Ribbon Sports” style.
