KOTA KINABALU: Sabah has begun screening passengers on arrival at Kota Kinabalu International Airport (KKIA) in light of the threat from the contagious Wuhan coronavirus.

Sabah Health and People’s Well-being minister Datuk Frankie Poon said KKIA is in high alert mode and will scan all international flight passengers entering the state

“In fact, screenings started at the disembarkation point after the aerobridge, even before Immigration clearance areas for flights from Wuhan effective Jan 4, ” he said.

He said isolation will be carried out immediately once a suspected patient is detected to prevent and avoid the spread of any virus.

“Currently, there are no reported cases of coronavirus in Sabah, ” Poon said in a statement Thursday (Jan 23).

He urged the public not to panic but be vigilant and adopt preventive measures in their daily life such as wearing proper face masks, regularly washing hands with soap and clean water and avoiding crowded areas.

At about 3am Thursday, Poon, together with Sabah Health Department director Datuk Christina Rundi and health officials, visited KKIA to inspect the facilities and procedures in place there.

This is so that they could find out first hand the inspection procedures to ensure that every international passenger and crew member goes through the thermal scanner at KKIA before Immigration clearance.

Poon said with Chinese New Year just around the corner, many locals were expected to return while overseas tourists especially those from China will also come to Sabah.

It has been reported that Wuhan, a city in central China, is now under quarantine.
