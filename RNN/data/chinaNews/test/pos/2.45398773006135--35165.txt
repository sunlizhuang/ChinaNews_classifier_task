While Starbucks has reported what CEO Kevin Johnson called “an exceptional quarter,” it also has closed 2,000 stores in China as the coronavirus situation unfolds.

The global coffee retailer intended to raise its full year financial outlook for fiscal 2020, but instead announced on its recent earnings call it was not revising guidance at this time due to the new coronavirus outbreak in China. Starbucks currently has over half its 4,292 stores closed in the market.

Shares of the company fell 1% in extended trading, Reuters reports.

“We are assessing this each and every day,” said John Culver, group president, International Channel Development & Global Coffee & Tea. “We do have delivery available to customers from stores that are remaining open. But again this is something that we continue to assess every day.”

Starbucks’ China revenues increased by 15% in its first quarter 2020, excluding a 2% impact of foreign exchange, fueled by a 16% increase in net new stores over the past 12 months and a 3% increase in comp.

China's mobile orders jumped to 15% of total revenue up from 10% the past quarter, while its 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members grew 40% over the prior year when the program was relaunched. For comparison, in the U.S., Starbucks’ ended the quarter with 18.9 million active rewards members, a 16% increase over prior year.

“At present, we are unable to reasonably estimate the impact to the business,” CFO Pat Grismer said. “Notwithstanding, the fact that our China business represented only 10% of our global revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect these events to have a material impact on our international segment and consolidated results for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2020. In any event based on what we currently know, we expect the impact to our business will be temporary.”
