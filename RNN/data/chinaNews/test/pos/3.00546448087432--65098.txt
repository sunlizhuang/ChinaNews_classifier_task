As crossover branding is now a hot trend for many sectors across the world, Devialet, the French acoustic engineering technology specialist known for audio products including high-end speakers, unveiled its latest product – Phantom Reactor Opéra de Paris in China to further enhance its market presence.

The company released this product in partnership with Opera National de Paris, also known as the Opera Garnier, to integrate innovative designs and French cultural elements to raise its popularity among consumers.

Opera National de Paris was built from 1861 to 1875 and is renowned for its opulence and its architect Charles Garnier.

Martin Ku, Devialet's general manager for the Asia-Pacific market region, said within a few months, China has become the brand's second-largest market after France in the world.

Since the brand started its expansion in China last year, the Paris-headquartered company opened stores in Beijing and Shanghai. The firm aims to sell more audio products in China, where a consumption upgrade has been on the books for a while.

China's young consumers are pursuing high-end products. Devialet will continue to deploy resources in the country's top-tier cities, adding more experience stores and conducting more licensing activities to attract market attention, Ku said.

"Brand collaboration arouses consumers' curiosity, giving them a new reason to spend. It usually generates unexpected market feedback. Their brand image can not only be promoted, but also used to boost sales," he noted.

After Devialet sells a Reactor Opéra, a part of the revenue will be used to support the artistic endeavors of Opera National de Paris.

In addition to partnering with the French cultural institute, the French company also introduced a smart speaker, Sound X, in association with Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co late last year. Both sides hope to gain more consumers via this partnership.
