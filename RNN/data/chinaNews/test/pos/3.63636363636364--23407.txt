Diverse Diving

While many enjoy the sea-life found in traditional scuba diving, Bali is the place to go further. For experienced divers or macro-photographers, muck diving is available throughout the island. Take a trip to Pemuteran Biorock and begin your hunt for gobies, scorpionfish, and eels.

Take Travel To New Heights

Looking for adventure on your Bali getaway? Head over to Tanjung Benoa where experienced professionals will show you how to strap on a jetpack and see the island from above. As you levitate up to ten meters above the water, take in the views of your surroundings and feel like a superhero as you do it. This water sport is available in various parts of Bali and should be booked in advance to ensure availability.

Time At The Tanah

One of the most famous tourist attractions in all of Bali is Tanah Lot Temple. This breathtaking structure has been separated from the mainland, leaving it surrounded by water at high tide. At low tide, you can walk to the Hindu temple for photo opportunities and moments of peace.

Dance and Drama

Traditional Balinese dance has a rich history of storytelling and expression. Dances often tell the stories of demons and evil spirits in Hindu scripture and how to overcome them. With angular movements of the body and wide emotion-filled eyes, dancers express the history of their culture. Shows can be found in almost every part of the island.

Paddy Pickin'

Feeling outdoorsy? The lush land of rice paddies found in Tabanan is a definite sight to see. As the sun shines over its emerald landscape, the fields of rice paddies can be experienced hands-on. Get down and dirty in the muddy fields and pick some rice as you learn the history of how it's grown and harvested.

Monkey Mayhem

What could be cuter than a temple full of monkeys? Take time to explore Monkey Forest in the village of Padangtegal, a community of Hindu temples that are home to more than 500 Balinese long-tailed monkeys. Be sure to grab a banana as you enter the grounds, and have your camera ready for prime photo opportunities with the rambunctious inhabitants. If you use a photo manager like ibi you can keep these photos for years to come.

Namaste in Ubud

Many tourists travel to Bali for the rest and meditation found in their various yoga retreats. Find your sense of peace and enlightenment on the island of Hindu tradition and awe-inspiring landscapes. The rich history of spirit and nature coexisting in Bali creates the premiere atmosphere for yoga enthusiasts to fully unwind and practice.

Snorkeling Spots Galore

There are endless possibilities when it comes to scuba diving in Bali. A lesser-known gem is The Reef at Kembali Beach Bungalows. With its often-calm currents and clear waters, the area is perfect for inexperienced snorkelers and families. You're sure to see wondrous marine life from sea turtles to butterflyfish.

Venture to Volcanos

Early risers and adventure seekers alike can make their way to an early-morning hike up Mount Batur. As one of the more novice treks on the island, this volcano has gorgeous views as the sun rises over Mount Agang and Mount Agung nearby. These hikes up various volcanos are one of the many activities to keep in mind when searching for "Travel Insurance Bali" and preparing for your visit.

Safari Species

Bali Marine and Safari Park is a must-see attraction for animal lovers. You can choose to visit for the day or stay the night to awake to the gentle giants roaming the grounds.
