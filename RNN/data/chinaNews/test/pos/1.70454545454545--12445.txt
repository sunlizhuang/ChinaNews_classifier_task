Benelli, the Italian motorcycle maker, is working on a new heavy duty touring motorcycle. The bike in question is expected to be the company's flagship tourer and will most likely be powered by a new 1.2-litre engine. It must be noted that the company has been working on this engine since 2017, when some details about this powerplant had surfaced on the internet. Though Benelli didn't share any details about this new engine back then, it did say that this 1,200 cc unit could be used on a new touring bike or an ADV. Now, some fresh media reports are hinting that the company has decided to go with a touring motorcycle for the debut of its 1.2-litre engine. There are also rumours that the aforementioned bike has been type-approved in China, further suggesting that it will most likely go into production. In case you didn't know, Benelli is owned by Qianjiang Group, a Chinese motorcycle maker.

Benelli's 1,200 cc touring bike will most likely sport a large front with a wide headlamp cluster, tall windscreen, big side panels, and long step-up style seat. Given that it's a touring bike, we expect it to get relaxed ergonomics via wide handlebars and low seating position. As for the engine, the 1,200 cc unit will most likely be a three-cylinder, liquid-cooled motor which will deliver around 130 bhp, making it the most powerful Benelli bike. The company will also equip its flagship touring bike with top-notch hardware like fully adjustable USD forks, large disc brakes, and several electronic interventions like cornering ABS, traction control system, etc.

Benelli 1,200 cc touring bike could make its debut at EICMA 2020, followed by launch in 2021. This year, however, the Italian motorcycle maker will launch a number of other bikes, including Leoncino 800, which was showcased at EICMA 2019. Other than this, the company will also bring its new TNT 600 to India and will upgrade its portfolio to BS 6.
