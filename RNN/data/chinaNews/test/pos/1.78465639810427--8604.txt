Coronation Street actress Sian Reeves has admitted that she was once very close to securing the role of Gina Seddon.

Sian, who's also known for her villainous role in Emmerdale, joined the Weatherfield cobbles back in September as Tim Metcalfe's secret Las Vegas wife Charlie Wood.

But it could've all been so different, if Connie Hyde hadn't impressed ITV bosses in her auditions.

Reflecting on the history behind her joining the soap, Sian recently explained: "I've been flirting with Coronation Street for a quite a while actually, I've always wanted to be in it.



"I got down to the final screen test to play Gina, Sally's sister, and Sally [Dynevor] and Michael [Le Vell] were so lovely that when this part came up I was thrilled."

Thankful to have such great castmates, the actress added: "The character of Charlie Wood has ticked every box for me and I still get to work with Sally.

"Joe Duttine is also such good fun to work with as well, this storyline has got Tim in such a spin."
