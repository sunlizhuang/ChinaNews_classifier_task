If you're looking to cut down on your meat and animal product intake, then Veganuary (AKA vegan January) is a great place to start. A UK-based non-profit, in the organization's own words: "Veganuary aims to reduce the suffering of animals by inspiring and supporting people across the globe to go vegan for the month of January."

Plenty of restaurants in Beijing have cottoned on to the idea too, offering good value deals to entice customers to give up the meat. These are a few of our favorites.

Gung Ho! has long been one of our favorite spots for alternative pizza options and they have recently cemented that reputation by expanding their range of vegetarian, vegan, and allergy-friendly toppings and pizza bases, and adding options like vegan cheese. For the whole month of January, they're offering 10 percent off their vegan menu, which includes sides, salads, burgers, and eight different pizzas.

In addition, Gung Ho! has created special Vegan Set Menu that will be available throughout the month of January with a new vegan pizza flavor: Vegan Meat Lover, made with vegan chicken, housemade pepperoni, and Omnipork. The menu serves two for RMB 199, including a vegan chicken burger, fig and pumpkin salad, the aforementioned pizza, and apple crumble with vegan ice cream.

This January and February, Moka Bros is celebrating plant-based life and offering rewards to diners who choose to eat vegetarian or vegan in their stores. Simply grab a Veganuary Punch Card from any Moka Bros location, eat vegan or vegetarian dishes (such as their vegan veggie medley salad, pictured above) 10 times, and they'll give you a free vegan or vegetarian power bowl on the house.

Obentos' menu of healthy Japanese-inspired cuisine includes plenty of meat-free options, from warming bento boxes to hearty grain bowls to fresh salads. They offer 20 percent off vegetarian and vegan dishes when you dine in-store at their Grand Summit location in Liangmaqiao on Monday. Some of their best plant-based dishes include the vegan spice box bento with seared organic tofu and gochujang sauce, and the avo grains bowl, which features plenty of its titular ingredients mixed with a sesame tofu dressing.

You may think of banh mi as being particularly porky but Rollbox's vegetarian and vegan options are sure to set your misconceptions straight. Try them all – including the grilled tofu and oyster mushroom bowl (vegan) or banh mi (vegetarian) – on Wednesday evening when dine-in customers get 20 percent off from 6-10pm.

Finally, Monday means buy-one-get-one-free on veggie burgers and salads at both of Slow Boat's locations (deal available with the purchase of a drink). Choose from old favorites like the Dongsi Tofu Burger and Mighty ‘Shroom Burger at the Sanlitun Brewpub or newer dishes like the Thai Vegan Chop Salad and Grilled Vegan burger at the Dengshikou Taproom. Freshly squeezed juices are also RMB 5 off if you really want to step up the healthiness.
