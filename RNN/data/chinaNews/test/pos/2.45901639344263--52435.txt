Oak Grove High School 2018 graduate Noah Harris wanted to take his deep belief in the value of education and turn it into something tangible.

So, during the summer after his senior year, he wrote and self-published a children's book called "Successville."

"In Oak Grove and Hattiesburg, there are a lot of kids that really need some extra encouragement to chase after what they want academically and occupationally," he said.

Success with 'Successville'

Harris, now a sophomore at Harvard University, has seen success with "Successville."

Pearl River Community College used the book last month as part of its Early Childhood Academy.

According to its website, the Early Childhood Academy is a statewide initiative that works with participating community and junior colleges. The Mississippi Department of Human Services and child care providers are involved, too.

The idea is to ensure that Mississippi’s early childhood system integrates resources and services for parents, caregivers and their children to prepare kids for kindergarten.

PRCC recently chose "Successville" to be used at TJ's Learning Center in Hattiesburg.

It used federal grant funds to buy a copy of "Successville" for about 90 pre-K children at TJ's.

"It's important to showcase our local talent and let the kids know what I can try to do to reach for my dreams," said Jana Causey, vice president for PRCC's Forrest County Operations.

Causey thought the book had just the right message for TJ's students. Harris explained what Successville is.

"The main goal of the book is that if you work hard and set goals and develop your talent, you can do whatever you want to do," Harris said. "(Successville) represents the place where everyone achieves their true potential."

Seeing a person who has been to 'Successville'

During a break from Harvard, Harris came back to Hattiesburg Jan. 22 and read the book to the children at TJ's.

"The children know that an author writes a book, but to be able to see him, touch him — being able to identify with him was very exciting," said Latifah Lowe, pre-K teacher at the learning center. "(The children) have never met an author before."

Lowe said seeing a local person go on to success was very inspiring for the children.

"They loved the message," she said. "They were so focused (afterwards) on what they wanted to be.

"We had doctors, lawyers, presidents."

Harris hopes his book can help many more children. Causey said she would like to have Harris come to other classrooms in the Early Childhood Academy and read his book.

PRCC's Early Childhood Academy serves 78 day careproviders across six counties.

"These kids got exposed to someone who had published this book at an early age, but was also at an Ivy League university," Causey said. "They were exposed to success at multiple levels."
