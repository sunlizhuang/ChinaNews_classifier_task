It’s been a long, tough week down the salt mines of reporting season. So perhaps a leisurely weekend will help us all make sense of how the market has shrugged off a fair-to-middling earnings season and the threat of coronavirus to set fresh records, such that it is now trading at 19 times earnings, compared with the long-run average of 14 times.

Or maybe not.

The market has shrugged off an average set of results to push valuations even higher. David Rowe

Say you hop out of bed and take the dog for a walk. On the way you stop in at the local Bendigo & Adelaide Bank ATM to get some cash. Then you remember that despite raising capital when it reported on Monday to help meet spiralling costs that will take years to get on top of, Bendigo shares are only down 3.7 per cent for the week. And, according to Bloomberg, the bank is trading on a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14.1 times, which is higher than both ANZ (trading on 12.8 times) and NAB (13.4 times). That’s despite the fact these large banks are much better placed to meet the intense pressures of technology and regulatory costs.

Slightly confused, you jump in your Holden Commodore, gently pat the steering wheel in wistful affection, and head down to Bunnings. Which, of course, is owned by Wesfarmers, the industrial/retail conglomerate that has been the second-biggest mover on the ASX 200 index this week, after reporting a solid enough result on Wednesday - albeit one scarred by those pesky underpayment issues. Wesfarmers is trading on a forward P/E of 27.2 times, up from 20 times a year ago, and just 11 times in June 2017. How things change, you think to yourself.

It’s back home to do a little repair work after last week’s storms. It’s a job you can tackle yourself, even though you’re insured with QBE, which reported on Monday. Despite missing guidance, it was a nice enough result. Chief executive Pat Regan – who spends his weekends on the soccer pitch – has done a good job stabilising a business known for surprising investors with bad news. But despite the fact he’s yet to deliver much in the way of growth, the stock jumped 7 per cent this week, to a five-year high. It’s now trading on a P/E of 16.3 times, handily above the 13 times that the US insurance sector trades on.
