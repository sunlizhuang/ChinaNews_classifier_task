MWC may have been cancelled, but that hasn't stopped Huawei from going ahead with a hardware event today. The Chinese tech giant showed off a new smart speaker, tablet, and even its next-generation foldable phone. And for Windows 10 fans, the Shenzhen firm unleashed the latest generation of its MateBook X Pro laptop.

The newest version of the MateBook X Pro boasts some of the best hardware you’ll find on a Windows 10 laptop, period. However, that’s certainly not the most exciting part of this new device.

As part of a push to improve the integration between its laptops and smartphones, Huawei introduced OneHop last year. At launch, the software allowed users to easily share photos, documents and items between a mobile device and a laptop or desktop PC. With the latest version, the Chinese firm is taking things to the next level.
