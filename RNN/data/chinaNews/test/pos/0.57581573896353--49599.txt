PETALING JAYA: Although the Chinese community is not completely against the teaching and learning of Science and Maths in English (PPSMI), it depends at which level one is pushing the system, say educationist groups.

MCA president Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong said when the move was first introduced in 2003, the Chinese educationists were not for it to be carried out in vernacular primary schools but 90% of secondary vernacular schools were in support of it.

“This is because all subjects need to be completely taught in Mandarin in the first six years of formal education to enable the pupils to master the language.

“Once they have mastered the language in Chinese primary schools, they are open to learning Science and Maths in English as this will be useful for them in the future.

“I was part of the government which introduced PPSMI and I know what happened.

“MCA did not oppose it but it depends at which level do you want to introduce it – primary or secondary?

“If primary, it is a ‘no’ due to the need for the mastery of Mandarin. If secondary, it is all right as the students would by then have mastered the Chinese language, ” said Dr Wee.

He was commenting on Prime Minister and acting Education Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad saying that PPSMI would be reintroduced in national schools.

United Chinese School Teachers Association of Malaysia (Jiao Zong) chairman Datuk Ong Chiow Chuen said primary vernacular Chinese schools must teach the two subjects in Mandarin.

“It is easier for the children to grasp the subject matters in a language they can understand, ” he said.

Chinese educationist group Dong Jiao Zong said it was not advisable for the government to revert to PPSMI, which it claimed was “a failed policy”.

“We agree with the urgency to improve English and Maths but the past lessons have proven that the policy was not viable.

“Education is a cause that affects a whole generation. If we insist on restarting this policy that violates the principles of education, it will inevitably impact the country’s development of education.

“Any Education Ministry policy should be practical and realistic, giving importance to the results of analysis and respecting the decisions of professionals.

“The new Malaysia’s education reform philosophy should not be stuck in the era of industrial rejuvenation at the end of the last century.

“We also urge the ministry to engage with relevant groups, scholars and experts and listen to their views before making any decision in the future instead of speaking through the media, aggravating the problems of teachers, parents and students.

“We also remind the Pakatan Cabinet meeting to reflect public opinion, respect the education profession, and carefully decide on this controversial policy, ” it said.

PPSMI was first introduced in 2003 to Year One in primary schools and Form One at the secondary level.

It was fully implemented in secondary schools in 2007 and primary schools in 2008 before it was abolished in 2013.

Since 2016, selected national schools have implemented the dual-language programme teaching Maths and Science in English.
