THE first-ever vehicle to make a soft landing on the 'dark-side' of the Moon has taken some eerie snapshots of its rarely-seen surface

China's Chang'e-4 spacecraft was sent on its mission around this time last year so to mark the one year anniversary the country has released some of the images and scientific data it collected.

The small Yutru 2 rover that was released by the spacecraft has travelled around 350 metres on the far side of the Moon's surface.

The far side of the Moon is commonly referred to as the 'dark side' because tidal forces from Earth have slowed down its rotation so much that the same side is always facing Earth.

This is a phenomenon called tidal locking.

Luckily for us, the Change'e-4 spacecraft and Yutru 2 rover were equipped with cameras so scientists could take a closer look at what's happening there.

As the Yutu 2 rover was roaming around it studied rock formations and took photos.

Scientists were able to control and connect with the lander and rover via a satellite that orbits the Moon.

They collected data over 12 lunar days.

As lunar days are equivalent to 29 days, 12 hours and 44 minutes on Earth, this means the rover was working hard for most of 2019.

The Chang'e-4 lander had a high-tech camera that could rotate 360 degrees mounted to the top of it.

It died at the end of the first lunar day but the Yutu 2 rover continued on.

The mission, which landed in the South Pole–Aitken basin impact crater in the southern hemisphere of the 'dark side' of the Moon, has produced the best data taken so far from the largely unexplored area.

China intends to launch a Chang'e-5 mission later this year.

It aims to bring 2kg of lunar surface material back to Earth.

This will be the most complicated robotic space mission China has attempted but, if it's successful, it will bring the first Moon samples back to Earth since 1976.

China is tracking Moon radiation levels and gathering soil samples ahead of plans to build a lunar base in the 2030s.

A canister strapped to Chang'e-4's lander was filled with seeds and silkworm eggs – part of an attempt to grow plants on the Moon.

The setup could be used by astronauts to sprout food on future lunar outposts.

The moon's dark side is ideal for human settlements because it houses water in the form of ice.

More research is needed to determine how safe it would be for people to live there long-term.

The Moon – our closest neighbour explained Here's what you need to know... The Moon is a natural satellite – a space-faring body that orbits a planet

It's Earth's only natural satellite, and is the fifth biggest in the Solar System

The Moon measures 2,158 miles across, roughly 0.27 times the diameter of Earth

Temperatures on the Moon range from minus 173 degrees Celcius to 260 degrees Celcius

Experts assumed the Moon was another planet, until Nicolaus Copernicus outlined his theory about our Solar System in 1543

It was eventually assigned to a "class" after Galileo discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610

The Moon is believed to have formed around 4.51billion years ago

The strength of its gravitational field is about a sixth of Earth's gravity

Earth and the Moon have "synchronous rotation", which means we always see the same side of the Moon – hence the phrase "dark side of the Moon"

The Moon's surface is actually dark, but appears bright in the sky due to its reflective ground

During a solar eclipse, the Moon covers the Sun almost completely. Both objects appear a similar size in the sky because the Sun is both 400 times larger and farther

The first spacecraft to reach the Moon was in 1959, as part of the Soviet Union's Lunar program

The first manned orbital mission was Nasa's Apollo 8 in 1968

And the first manned lunar landing was in 1969, as part of the Apollo 11 mission
