DONATIONS to Bundaberg's political candidates for the March local government election have tallied up to $7500, higher than any of the 77 local government areas outside of Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast.

The amount is higher than Townsville City, $950, Toowoomba, $3755, and Fraser Coast, $6120. But it's a fraction compared to the money thrown into Ipswich, $100,000, Brisbane City, $45,000, Gold Coast City, $36,000, and Sunshine Coast, $27,000.

Most of Bundaberg candidates' gift disclosures to the Electoral Commission of Queensland have come from their partners, or from the family's joint-bank account.

About half of the disclosed gifts come from Division 9 candidate May Mitchell, who has made 14 payments to her campaign account since December 9.

She disclosed $3919.10 in funding as it was from a joint-account she shared with her husband Dale.

When Ms Mitchell announced her intention to run for council last month, she said she welcomed changes to local government legislation, aimed at tackling transparency and to show how donations were disclosed.

"Early disclosure of donations to candidates allows voters to know who is behind each candidate," she said at the time.

The ECQ states that candidates do not have to disclose the funds they move from their personal account to their election account.

"However, funds from a joint bank account held with a spouse or other person are not considered personal funds," and ECQ spokesman said.

"They should be disclosed as being gifts from the other account holders."

"Similarly, funds originating from a candidate's business or another entity in which they have an interest are not considered personal funds and must be disclosed."

Candidates had to disclose gifts and loans worth more than $500 within seven business days.

The three mayoral candidates have disclosed no gifted funding as of yesterday.

Mayoral candidate Helen Blackburn disclosed in-kind support worth $5458.75.

It had reportedly been an error and has been removed from the disclosures.

Division 5 candidate Greg Barnes submitted four disclosures in 2017.

They included gifts of an unknown value from Chinese developer Sheng Wei.

These gifts were "assorted sponsored hospitality benefits", and included a damaged painting, a meat cleaver, and books about architecture from Bundaberg's Chinese sister city, Nanning.

He also disclosed free use of floor space at Bargara Central shopping centre where he could complete community consultation and Justice of the Peace services between May 2014 and October 2018.

He valued this service at $500.

Cr Barnes also disclosed a discount given to him on a lounge suite at Harvey Norman in February 16, 2017, which he estimated to be worth $500.

Last month his wife Isobel donated $260 to his electoral campaign.

Bundaberg businessman Tim Sayre made three payments through his business Augmented Reality Marketing worth $1357.62.

Division 6 candidate Tanya McLoughlin disclosed $1000 through four payments from her husband Chris, dating from January 21 to February 21.

Division 8 councillor Steve Cooper received $50 from Diane Cooper, and $84.98 to boost his Facebook posts to a wider audience.

Division 1 candidate Jason Bartels disclosed $500 from Jillian Bartels on January 17.
