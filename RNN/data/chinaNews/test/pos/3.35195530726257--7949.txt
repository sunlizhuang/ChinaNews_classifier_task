Two 230 kV substations and two 230 kV double-circuit transmission lines with a total length of about 300 kilometers were newly built, starting from the Taipingjiang Hydropower Station in Kachin State and ending near Mandalay, the second largest city in Myanmar. The high-quality and efficient construction of the project as well as its successful coming into service has been highly recognized and appreciated by the Ministry of Electricity and Energy of Myanmar.
