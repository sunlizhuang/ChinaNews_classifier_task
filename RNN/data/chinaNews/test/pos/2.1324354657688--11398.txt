Senator Birmingham's initial view, however, was more upbeat, despite strained relations with Australia's biggest trading partner.

“The market reaction is the right reaction, it would seem,” Senator Birmingham said.

"On the whole, there is more upside than potential downside for Australia given the lift it appears to have given to markets and confidence.

"We have consistently called for an end to the trade hostilities and delivery of greater economic certainty and welcome the fact that this agreement appears to have more substance than many commentators expected.

"Hopefully it does provide a sustained period of cessation in trade hostilities between the US and China and can therefore be a stabilising and even growth impetus for the global economy."

Local dairy and infant formula producers such as A2 and Bellamy’s, which have already been facing long licensing delays in China, could be disadvantaged by a clause in the US-China trade deal.

“China has committed to streamline the timelines and procedures for registering US dairy and infant formula facilities and products and to provide regulatory certainty and market stability,” a statement on the agreement said.

Senator Birmingham said he would pursue the same terms for Australia's dairy, baby formula and broader industries.

“It’s no secret there have been some companies frustrated with getting licensing approvals in those areas and we have taken that up with China,” he said.

“We would hope the same standards in terms of licensing and approvals will apply to all nations that can meet those standards and we’re confident Australia can do that.

"That's certainly a message we'll be conveying and encouraging China to heed."

Winners and losers

Australian beef exports, which have surged in recent years, would continue to enjoy a tariff advantage over US producers, as would wine, almonds and wool thanks to the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement.

An agreement by China to buy an additional $US200 billion ($290 billion) of goods from the US over two years could eat into future potential growth of Australia’s exports to China.

But Senator Birmingham said increased US agricultural sales to China would largely come from pork, poultry and soybeans, where Australia was a relatively small player.

Some $US80 billion of China's agreed purchases would be from US manufacturers, to which Australian firms had a low exposure.

"It's relatively modest in terms of its potential impact for Australia," Senator Birmingham said.

"It's a $US200 billion over a two-year purchase agreement. China's total volume of imports in 2018 grew by around $US260 billion, so if that trajectory were to continue over the next couple of forward years, we would expect that this $US200 billion constitutes well under half of purely the growth in China's imports over that period of time.

"Essentially, it's the US securing a significant share of that growth rather than substituting existing markets."

Long-term view for energy

Australia's long-term contracts for liquefied natural gas sales to China should largely insulate any near-term hit from China's pledge to buy an extra $US52.4 billion of energy from the US, but the deal will intensify competitive pressure on new local projects.

Australia, the world's largest LNG exporter, is China's largest supplier, contributing almost 40 per cent of its LNG imports.

Senator Birmingham said the energy deal covered oil, not just LNG. "Of course our LNG contracts tend to be quite long term, so there can be a fair degree of confidence that any LNG from the US will meet China's additional needs rather than their existing needs," he said.

Credit Suisse energy analyst Saul Kavonic said Chinese buyers would likely remain wary of signing up to long-term LNG contracts from the US until there was more certainty on a stable trading environment with the US, and given the two-year commitments couldn't be met anyway by new US LNG projects, which would only start mid-2020s.

"So any appetite for long-term LNG contracts in China may remain focused on sources outside the US, such as Australia, for the time being," Mr Kavonic said.

Senator Birmingham said China's agreement to reforms on intellectual property protection, piracy and currency transparency had given the agreement added substance.

The improvements, which some commentators say are only fairly minor, “would absolutely apply across the board” to all countries which trade with China.

“In those areas if China delivers then the US has got a breakthrough that the EU, Japan, Singapore, ourselves and many others would welcome as well,” Senator Birmingham said.

Unknown effect

Minerals Council of Australia acting chief executive Gavin Lind said: "The trade war between the US and China has shaken markets across the globe, so any easing of trade tensions between those countries is good for business confidence, the world economy and financial markets.

"The effect of a bilateral deal between the US and China on commodity markets is not yet known, and will partly depend on the proportions of LNG, coal and gas that make up the deal.

"The physical capacity of US energy production and transport infrastructure suggests the US may be challenged in supplying $US26.2 billion in energy to China. Yet even half of this supply volume would represent a significant shift.

"This deal will also undermine the principles of free trade and multilateralism, which have underpinned Australia’s bipartisan approach to trade policy for many decades."
