“Expressing satisfaction over the excellent bilateral relations, Shringla stressed that the two countries can further promote ties in areas like defence cooperation, trade and people to people contact,” it said.

The statement said Shringla told the envoy that he plans to visit Dhaka to prepare the ground for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bangladesh to attend the birth centenary of Mujibur Rahman on March 17.

“India wants to see the impending visit of Modi to become mutually beneficial to both the countries,” the statement quoted Shringla as saying.
