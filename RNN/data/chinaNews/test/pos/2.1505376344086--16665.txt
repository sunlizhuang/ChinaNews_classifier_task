While the media and Democrat narrative is all impeachment, the President is forging forward with his economic agenda success.

Fresh off the trade agreements with China, and Mexico and Canada, he’s now in Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum, attended by heads of state and global corporations. His address to the attendees was more than just a tout of the great American economy, it was a blueprint for other countries, to put their working citizens first and see how they thrive. It was a call for free market enterprise and the liberty and ever improving lives of those who practice it. It was a call for optimism instead of the ever-present pessimism of the “prophets of doom”, as he called them. It was a rousing speech.

A major takeaway for me; Trump pointed out that 25% of global investment by multi-national corporations has come to America with his Presidency. Twenty-five percent!

And thus, no surprise that Texas Governor Greg Abbott is also in Davos, hoping to steer some of that investment to the Lone Star State.
