SM TAFE recognised for bringing the TAFE model to the Zhejiang Province in China

New Memorandum of Understanding signed ensuring TAFE remains a preferred training provider in China

South Metropolitan TAFE (SM TAFE) has been named one of the Top 50 Vocational Institutions in the Asia-Pacific for a second consecutive year.

Education and Training Minister Sue Ellery today accepted the prestigious award on behalf of the Western Australian Government. The award was presented by the International Cultural Resource Organisation (ICRO) at a ceremony in Shanghai.

Only one other Australian training organisation, the Melbourne Institute of Technology, featured on the list.

The 2019 Asia Pacific Vocational Schools Top 50 Influential Awards announcement was made at the Education Forum for Asia Annual Conference hosted by the Chinese Higher Education Society and the Chengdu Municipal Government late last year.

The award recognises training institutions that have made outstanding contributions in the cultivation of technical and skilled personnel in the Asia-Pacific.

SM TAFE was recognised for its work with ICRO and the Zhejiang Provincial Government to successfully roll out the TAFE model across the region. This involved working on in-country delivery of the Advanced Diploma of Engineering with the Zhejiang Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering and establishing professional development programs with Ningbo Polytechnic, Wuhan Technical College of Communications and the Zhejiang Institute of Economics and Trade.

ICRO collaborates with overseas educational providers, such as SM TAFE, to promote high-quality foreign educational programs, resources, undergraduate and postgraduate programs as well as conferences and study tours.

To further strengthen the relationship between SM TAFE and ICRO, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the two organisations today. The MoU will progress new training opportunities in China in 2020 in Aged Care, Individual Support and Remedial Massage.

WA has long-standing ties with the Zhejiang Province through its Sister State agreement, which has been active since 1987.

In August 2019 the McGowan Government launched WA’s first Asian Engagement Strategy which will support the relationships, knowledge and skills necessary to grow trade and investment with Asian markets, diversifying and expanding the State’s economy and creating jobs.

As stated by Education and Training Minister Sue Ellery:

“Winning this prestigious award for a second consecutive year is no small feat and is a true testament to the hard work and commitment of South Metropolitan TAFE and the high standard of the Western Australian TAFE system.

“This award reinforces not only South Metropolitan TAFE’s reputation in China as a high-quality vocational education and training provider, but ensures TAFE remains a preferred provider for future projects in China.

“Western Australia’s vocational education and training sector is one of the best in the world.

“The commitment to developing quality international partnerships in the Asia Pacific region supports the McGowan Government’s Asian Engagement Strategy and responds to the need to diversify our economy and create skilled jobs for Western Australians.”
