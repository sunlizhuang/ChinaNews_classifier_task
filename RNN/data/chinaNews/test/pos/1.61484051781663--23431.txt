WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump revealed the official logo for the new U.S. Space Force, a branch of the military that the administration created last year. But to many, the logo seemed more than a little familiar.

The logo bears a striking resemblance to the insignia that represents the fictional Starfleet Command in the "Star Trek" franchise.

Pointing to threats from China and Russia and the nation’s reliance on satellites for defense operations, Trump has long pressed for the branch. He finally saw it through in December as part of a defense bill.

“America’s armed forces are more powerful than ever," Trump said at the time, "and growing even stronger."

Trump argues that U.S. adversaries are weaponizing "Earth's orbits with new technology targeting American satellites," expanding the need for a space-specific military branch. China and Russia have explored military expansion into space and France has also announced its own version of Space Force.

Trump has received ridicule for the focus he has placed on Space Force since his campaign. Many were perplexed when Space Force uniforms were unveiled earlier this month in a camouflage print. The answer? Most service members will be working on the ground, not in space.

But the Starfleet was the first thought for many as Trump tweeted out the new logo, which he said was consulted on by military leaders and designers.

The original series' Hikaru Sulu himself chimed in. "Ahem. We are expecting some royalties from this," said actor George Takei.

But as conservative analyst John Noonan, an aide to Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., pointed out, the logo is a modified version of a pre-existing Air Force Space Command logo. ("Star Trek: The Original Series" predates that command, too.)
