Andrew Castle has predicted that Meghan Markle will have 'wellness range' in two years, while Prince Harry will start his own line of 'Sussex Royal underpants'.

The broadcaster, 56, from Epsom, appeared on This Morning today alongside Bev Turner, 46, from Manchester, to discuss whether those with royal connections should be able to cash in on their status by promoting products.

This comes after The Queen's eldest grandson, Peter Phillips, 42, appeared in two TV adverts for a Chinese state-owned dairy firm while Princess Diana's niece Lady Kitty Spencer was seen endorsing Satine Jersey milk in a photoshoot.

Andrew said that while he has no problem with the royals using their status to 'make some money' he believes that the antics of Phillips and Spencer will 'pale in comparison' to what's to come for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

He said: 'If it's okay to be on the cover [of a magazine] as Kitty Spencer has been, as a successful model for the last five years, flogging Dolce & Gabbana or something - what's wrong with flogging some Chinese milk company?

'This pales into insignificance compared to what's coming from Harry and Meghan, by the way.

'Can you imagine what they're going to do? Surely Harry's gonna come out with a line of Sussex royal underpants and surely there will be a wellness range for Meghan, two or three years down the line.'

Host Holly Willoughby weighed in, suggesting that the couple may take a more behind-the-scenes approach, such as the Obama's have done with streaming service Netflix.

'But a wellness range for Meghan would be okay wouldn't it?', asked Andrew.

Phillip Schofield then interrupted, insisting the couple would likely only do 'classy' and 'high quality threshold stuff'.

After Bev insisted that she wishes the couple 'all the best', Andrew added: I do too.

'You've got to make some money. He [Phillips] doesn't take any money, does he - Peter Philips from the public purse? It was good fun watching the advert though.'

The discussion arose, after Princess Anne's son was seen in the TV ad, holding a glass of milk in front of a stately home, with the caption: 'British Royal Family member Peter Phillips.'

Mr Phillips, who grew up on his mother's estate in Gloucestershire, boasts in the advert of being brought up on Jersey milk from the herd at Windsor.

Sales pitch: Lady Kitty Spencer helps launch the Chinese Jersey milk brand in a commercial event at the British Museum

A spokesman for Longleat House, the Wiltshire property used in the commercial, said permission had not been granted.

The revelation will intensify the row about 'royals for rent', as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex embark on their new lives .

Harry and Meghan have had to promise not to use their HRH titles to cash in as they set about becoming 'financially independent'.

Mr Phillips and his sister Zara have never had HRH status, and both have come under scrutiny in the past for the way they make money.

Meanwhile, Spencer is plugging a rival Chinese daily brand and the 29-year-old model, a first cousin to Princes William and Harry, in an ad that sees her posing for a cup of tea at the British Museum.

She told Chinese journalists: ‘The day of the Royal Family usually begins with a cup of milk or a cup of tea.’
