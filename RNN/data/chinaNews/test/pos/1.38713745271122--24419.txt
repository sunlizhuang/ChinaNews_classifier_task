The cloud computing and software services division of e-commerce giant Amazon, Amazon Web Services, will build a data infrastructure hub in Jakarta by the end of next year or in early 2022. It will be the biggest investment in Indonesia’s information and technology sector, the country’s industry minister Agus Gumiwang said after a meeting with Amazon representatives at the 2020 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

The hub, which Amazon calls “region,” is a physical location where its data centers are clustered. Each region consists of multiple, isolated and physically separate “availability zones” within an area. Jakarta will join Hong Kong, Beijing and Ningxia in China, Mumbai, Seoul, Singapore, Tokyo and Sydney as “regions” in Asia-Pacific. There are 14 other regions across the globe.

“This investment can boost Indonesia to become a strategic digital hub,” the minister said, adding that the data centers would also accelerate the transformation of the nation’s small and medium companies, as well as big corporations in various sectors toward the digital industry 4.0 and also help create more jobs and companies, particularly startups, in the technology sector. The government will also partner with Amazon Web Services to provide cloud computing training for “hundreds of thousands of Indonesians” by 2025, he noted.
