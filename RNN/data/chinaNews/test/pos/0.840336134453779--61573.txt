The Sri Lankan students, who returned from Wuhan, China and currently quarantined at the Diyatalawa Army Camp are in good health with no signs of any infection by the coronavirus, Army spokesman Brigadier Chandana Wickramasinghe said yesterday.

He told Daily Mirror that the students were being monitored for any symptoms and their body temperature checked three times a day.

The Brigadier said there were 33 students including nine family members currently housed at the camp and the situation remained positive.

“However, if any complication arises, officers are on standby to take necessary action,” he said. (Thisari Walawege)
