Perth USAsia Centre's Senior Fellow Erin Watson-Lynn says "the reality" is Australia is "overly dependent on China in terms of trade," as the Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrives in Canberra to meet with Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

The Australian is reporting Prime Minister Scott Morrison has defined Indonesia as playing a crucial role in the government's push to diversity Australia's economy and broaden trade outside of its heavy reliance on China.

Ms Watson-Lynn told Sky News "it makes sense" for Mr Morrison to attempt to broaden national trade links with Indonesia.

"We already have a really good security relationship with Indonesia, it's going to be the fourth largest economy by middle of the century".

"Which is not that far away".
