ISLAMABAD, Feb. 3 (Gwadar Pro) - The Spokesperson at the Chinese foreign ministry has acknowledged Pakistan and other countries for showing satisfaction over treatment of patients suffering from coronavirus.

Contrary to what Indian government has done by placing a ban on export of personal protection equipment such as masks and clothing amid a global coronavirus outbreak, the Pakistani government on the other hand has shown solidarity and gesture of friendship by sending 300,000 medical masks to China.

Besides the masks, 800 hazmat suits and 6,800 pairs of gloves were also sent to China giving a clear message that the Pakistani government and its people are standing by their 'Iron Brother' in its hour of emergency.

A Pakistani doctor has also won the hearts of Chinese people by deciding to offer his services to help the country fight against the deadly coronavirus. Dr. Usman is the first Pakistani doctor who stepped forward to treat infected people in Wuhan as a volunteer.

Moreover, Pakistani government officials including the Pakistan Foreign Minister, special assistant to Prime Minister on health, and Pakistan’s ambassador to China announced that the government will not bring its citizens back home despite multiple requests from the students and their families for immediate evacuation.

While governments abroad are continuing efforts to bring their citizens home, the Pakistani government on the other hand has decided not to repatriate its citizens stranded in China from the coronavirus-hit Wuhan city to show "solidarity" with China.

Pakistan clearly emphasized that China has the best medical facilities to handle the patients suffering from the disease. Pakistan stands firmly with its Chinese brothers and will provide full assistance as Beijing tackles the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.

Earlier, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi while talking to Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi appreciated Pakistan’s offer for help and support to China in this difficult time highlighting the deep friendship between the two neighbors.

China and Pakistan are close neighbors and have a fine tradition of helping each other in time of need. Pakistan has always taken China as its best, time-tested and all-weather friend. Both have long praised the close ties the two countries have with each other. And the same trust and cooperation has also been seen recently.

Under the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping, China has established a nationwide mechanism and has taken decisive measures to prevent and control the epidemic. At present, all work is progressing in an orderly manner, and China is fully capable of and confident in achieving its final victory.
