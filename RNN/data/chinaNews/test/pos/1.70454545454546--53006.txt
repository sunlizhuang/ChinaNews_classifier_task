The New Zealand Government has placed temporary entry restrictions into New Zealand to assist with the containment of the Novel Coronavirus.

Any foreign travellers who leave or transit mainland China after 2 February 2020 New Zealand time will be refused entry to New Zealand. New Zealand citizens and permanent residents returning to New Zealand will still be able to enter, as will their immediate family members, but will be required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival back in the country.

We are working closely with our border sector colleagues to implement these new entry criteria.

As a result of the robust screening of passengers in Australia, Singapore and the United States, the Ministry of Health says New Zealand can reduce its screening of passengers arriving on flights from those three countries.

Customs will therefore open its eGates for passengers arriving on flights from Australia, Singapore and the United States, who are eligible to use eGates, from mid-afternoon on 5 February 2020. The Ministry of Health advises there are no public health concerns arising from this decision.

Passengers arriving in New Zealand on flights from all other countries cannot use eGates, and will continue to have their passports physically checked by a Customs Officer.

All passengers arriving in New Zealand will continue to be risk assessed and screened using a number of methods by government agencies before they are allowed to enter the country. Any passenger identified as high risk is referred to Public Health Officers.

We ask for your ongoing understanding and patience as we help to protect New Zealand from the Novel Coronavirus.

The decision to open eGates for eligible passengers arriving on flights from Australia, Singapore and the United States, is in line with the 48-hour review processs advised by the Government when it announced the placing of temporary entry restrictions into New Zealand on 2 February 2020.
