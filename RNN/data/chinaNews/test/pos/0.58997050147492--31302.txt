After five years in which the investment return of the technology-focused Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust (LSE: SMT) was nearly double that of the FTSE All-World index, relative performance slowed in 2019. In the first nine months an investment return of “only” 16.7% lagged both the FTSE All-World index and the average for the global IT sector.

Many believed that high-growth companies had become overvalued and criticism mounted of the low tax paid by the US technology titans, their dominant market positions and their lack of regulation. Scottish Mortgage was increasing its exposure to private equity, yet doubts have grown about some of the valuations of these companies.

Optimism has dwindled

James Anderson and Tom Slater, Scottish Mortgage’s managers at Baillie Gifford, accept the change of mood. “There was utopian optimism ten years ago,” says Slater, “but now it is apparent that technology and related services can be used for good and bad.” Still, “the rise of the online monopolists and the emergence of China as a technology superpower are the investment features of the last ten years” and the pace of change will continue. “The power of these monopolies continues to increase and it is extremely difficult to compete with them as they own the consumer relationship and are commoditising the supply chain.”

“I’m not sure if it would be bad for Amazon to be split into two,” says Anderson, “while regulation freezes the competitive environment, increasing the dominance of big companies. The danger is that they lose their dynamism thereby.”
