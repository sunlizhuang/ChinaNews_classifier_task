President Trump is celebrating recent trade deals as wins for America's farmers. He spoke at the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual convention in Texas Sunday. He credited farmers with staying loyal to him through tough times as he negotiated trade deals with China, Mexico and Canada. He said both the first part of the China trade agreement and the USMCA deal will see farmers greatly increasing exports. Trump also took the chance to take aim at Democrats. He questioned what he's gotten from his efforts, except being impeached. He blamed impeachment on "radical left lunatics."
