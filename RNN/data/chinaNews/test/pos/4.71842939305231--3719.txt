CAMPBELL, Calif., January 9, 2020 – Centric Software® is delighted to announce the release of a success story about its customer, MAXRIENY.

MAXRIENY is a CC Universe brand, and was co-founded by Kevin Wong and his wife, Sara Wong. The brand had specific target segments in mind right from the start — fans of European medieval castle themes and fantasy elements. In just five years, sales surpassed 0.7 billion RMB in China’s already saturated ladies apparel market.

Kevin Wong, Founder and CEO of CC Universe reflects on the product development challenges presented to their multi-business brand:

“Our multi-brand and multi-business model corporate development strategy would have created an enormous workload if we continued to operate with disparate systems and offline data. The company’s priority is establishing a sharing platform that allows us to store all product creative and data.”

Today, with Centric’s Fashion PLM in place, there is a streamlined way for CC Universe to obtain consistent data. Team members can track product development by brand and business model, which greatly improves the management capacity of their Product Center.

Adrian Lian, who heads CC Universe’s IT Department, comments on Centric’s synergy with innovation, “Centric Fashion PLM has always been at the forefront of applications and innovations in the fashion and retail industry. The PLM system provides a fundamental platform for integrating upstream and downstream supply chain systems.”

How did Centric Fashion PLM empower a multi-brand strategy for MAXRIENY and CC Universe?

MAXRIENY was launched in 2007, and its parent company CC Universe was co-founded by Kevin Wong and his wife, Sara Wong. The couple transformed their family-owned apparel manufacturing operations into Shenzhen CC Universe Fashion Design Co., Ltd. Kevin handles strategic investments and organizational innovation, while Sara takes full charge of design for MAXRIENY, their main brand, as well as product management. MAXRIENY is highly inspired by the European retro elements, as the design of the brand is known to present unique, fantasy styles with the sense of inner power. It is one of the most popular emerging designer brands. Sara believes that fashion is never just about a fancy garment but it is also the expression of art.
