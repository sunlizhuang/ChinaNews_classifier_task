One hundred youths in Anambra State are presently undergoing training under the 3rd Batch of the State Government’s Youths Empowerment initiative, One Youth One Skill.

The 10-day training which is ongoing at the NYSC Permanent Orientation Camp, Umuawulu/Mbaukwu, has as its participants, youths from all parts of the state.

The initiative was launched by Anambra State Government to arm youths of the state with skills that will improve their quality of living, change their mentality of dependence on government for everything and grant them access to start-up resources.

One of the youths at training, Mokwe Norbert, a graduate of Federal Polytechnic Oko, said the training will help him achieve his ambition of pursuing a career in Photography.

“It has been my life ambition to be a professional photographer. When I finished higher education, I was not able to secure any job. After many years, the Anambra Government is giving me this opportunity to acquire practical training and start-up my own business. This is just what our youths need from government, that is genuine efforts at empowering them. If this is accomplished, we will have lesser youths roaming the streets jobless,” he said.

Another youth, Mabel Anyadubalu who majors in Confectionery and 3D flooring, said she is optimistic that the training will equip her with all the knowledge and skills required to own her own business and be able to employ others.

“I thank the government for this opportunity. I also pray that they extend it to cover other teeming youths who are not yet gainfully engaged. Through this program, I want to be able to create wealth and job opportunities for others,” she said.

Speaking on the initiative, the State Commissioner for Youth Empowerment and Creative Economy, Hon Afam Mbanefo said since its inception, more than 750 persons have been trained and over 50 persons provided with Starter-Packs to kick-start their businesses.

“The era of white-collar jobs is over. Today, many graduates of higher institutions are without jobs and this is the reason why we initiated this program. We want Anambra Youths to be skills-driven so that they can create jobs for others. In China, the increase in their national GDP and overall economic growth is as a result of the commitment of youths in skills acquisition and entrepreneurship,” he pointed out.

The Youths Commissioner revealed that 35 outstanding trainees will be empowered at the end of the program.

According to him, “We will select 5 persons from each skill for the empowerment. Many will be given access to grants and other funding supports; some will be equipped with necessary materials and accessories to start their preferred skill trade while others will undergo internships for proper mentoring towards becoming leaders in their chosen skill areas. I encourage the youths to take the training seriously. They have no excuse after the program to remain unproductive which makes them indulge in social vices.

“Some other ongoing programs include All-In-One Creative Centre, Project Smart Jobs, Tripple I (Inventor Investor Initiative), Youth Entrepreneurship Start-up (YES Program), Movie Village, Youth In Agriculture Project and Anambra Concert. Others include The Youth TV, Funding Supports and the Digital Entrepreneurship Office, a center for nurturing and expansion of ICT Development, TechNovation and Digital Entrepreneurship.”

The Chief Youths Development Officer, Ministry of Youths Empowerment and Creative Economy, Mrs. Chito Osili said they are monitoring the youths trained in the earlier batches to provide them support to continue to soar.

According to her, they are all doing well with the Starter-Packs provided them.
