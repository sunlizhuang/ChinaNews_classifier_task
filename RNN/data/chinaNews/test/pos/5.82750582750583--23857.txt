The young students of Balbriggan Chinese Language School held a special exhibition in Balbgriggan Library last weekend, showcasing the very finest of their Chinese calligraphy and artwork.

Students from six to ten years' old unveiled their painstakingly created work to families and friends and the wider Balbriggan community, all in celebration of Chinese New Year 2020.

Speaking in the run-up to the event, Assistant Principal of Balbriggan Chinese Language School, Ye Wang, explained what the day was all about:

'It's a celebration for the Chinese New Year, and all the paintings are by all the kids from our school. We just wanted to make an exhibition in the library for all of the community of the Chinese students. It will be the students' families and their parents as well, and all the community in Balbriggan, and Our Balbriggan will be coming as well.

'These are all children from the Balbriggan Language School art class, so these paintings are from work the children did last year. At the moment, we have a Chinese art class, which is only for Chinese students at the moment because it's all Chinese painting and Chinese calligraphy, but we'll probably have a class in the future for other students as well.'

Ye says: 'We teach Chinese students and then we have another class with students from Spain and Ireland, just a small class because we only started that class last year. For Chinese students we started classes two years ago but for international students we only started last year.'

Ye says that because the Chinese language is gaining in popularity, Balbriggan Chinese Language School is encouraging people in the community to learn the language themselves.

Based in Flemington Community Centre in Balbriggan, the school holds language classes for children and teenagers from both Chinese and non-Chinese backgrounds.

In true community spirit, the one-hour classes are offered at a nominal fee of â‚¬5 to encourage people to join.
