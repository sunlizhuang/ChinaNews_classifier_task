TARAWA, Kiribati (Press Release) — The Tourism Authority of Kiribati acknowledge and welcome’s the People’s Republic of China’s announcement to declare Kiribati as a tourism destination for Chinese citizens.

This announcement comes following the historical state visit to China by Kiribati President Taneti Maamau.

The Approved Destination Status or ADS is the arrangement between the Chinese government and the government of Kiribati to let Chinese holiday travelers visit Kiribati in a tour group. The ADS therefore give the Tourism Authority of Kiribati or TAK the permission to promote Kiribati as a holiday destination in China and presents Kiribati with the opportunity to grow tourism accordingly.

The China outbound tourism market continues to enjoy year on year growth recording 63.1 million international outbound trips in 2019. Such growth is fueled by the increase in disposable personal income, waiving of visa requirements into selected countries and the growing desire by Chinese nationals to travel the world. The Chinese outbound market also spends generously, and forecasts indicate global Chinese tourism spending to exceed $163 billion by 2024.





Kiribati is a small Pacific island destination, but TAK is optimistic that with adequate tourism infrastructure development, the Chinese visitor market can drive tourism revenue growth and create new employment opportunities for Kiribati.

Tourism Authority of Kiribati Chief Executive Officer Petero Manufolau says that “growth from China market will be based on a sustainable low volume, high value holiday experience promoting the unique cultures, diverse marine life, the laid-back lifestyle in the islands and its people.”

Manufolau adds that Air Kiribati’s new Embraer E190 jets which are scheduled to commence international services from March 2020 will also play an important role in helping facilitate growth of its China international visitor market.

To prepare the destination for the Chinese market, TAK has commenced discussions and work on the adoption of a national China-Ready training program, tourism investment opportunities portfolio, Chinese tour operator product training and destination marketing initiatives to raise awareness of the Kiribati in China.
