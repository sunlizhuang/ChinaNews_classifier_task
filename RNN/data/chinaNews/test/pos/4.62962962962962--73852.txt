Renowned African people who have long been friends with China sent messages of encouragement to support Wuhan, the epicenter of the CORVID-19 epidemic.

Manne Dipico, president of the South Africa-China People’s Friendship Association, wrote a letter to his Chinese friends on February 6, saying that, “China has informed the WHO and all other countries in a timely manner after discovering the virus, which successfully reduced the spread of the epidemic worldwide. All over China, more and more patients are being cured and discharged. I have faith and belief that China will defeat the epidemic soon with its strong leadership, efficient methods and advanced biotechnology.”

“Medical staff in Wuhan are the real heroes,” said Ehab Gouda, co-founder of the Egyptian Dragon Boat Academy. He was also touched by a video which has gone viral on social media where people in Wuhan shouting “Jiayou” (“Stay Strong” in English) to each other.

With emotions, he wrote a poem:

The real heroes

medical staff in Wuhan

Go China!

Wuhan refueling

Wuhan doctor refueling

Revive China

He also said, “Egyptian leadership and its people are in cooperation and solidarity with China. We hope the virus can be eradicated as soon as possible and life can be back to normal.”

Sherif M. Abdel Hamid, foreign affairs coordinator of Cairo Governorate, also sent a letter to his friends in China: “Dearest friends,my heart cries out for those who have lost loved ones to coronavirus and for all those impacted by the virus in China. We sincerely pray for the protection of China and all other affected nations, hoping the virus will stop spreading further.”

Ezzeddine Jebali, president of the Tunisia-China Friendship Association (TCFA), said his heart cries out while learning that such a large-scale epidemic is occurring in China. He hoped Chinese friends can stay healthy and safe, and that China will be able to overcome the difficulty as soon as possible.
