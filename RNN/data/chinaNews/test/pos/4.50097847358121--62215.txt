In bright costumes of purple, blue, yellow and red, the Lucky Lion Dancers wound their way west down J Street before turning the corner north onto Third Avenue in the heart of San Diego’s Chinatown.

They pushed past the century-old Chinese Historical Museum and offices of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, chasing away evil and bringing good luck and happiness to the new year.

The 38th Annual San Diego Chinese New Year Fair officially kicked off the Chinese Lunar New Year on a temporary stage set up at Third and Island avenues Saturday morning.

“This is where the Chinese community lived, worked and breathed,” Lilly Cheng, a Chinese scholar and San Diego State University professor, told the crowd. “We are so glad you are here today to celebrate this great tradition.”

Hundreds of people gathered to watch the opening ceremony of the two-day festival. Thousands more streamed through the two-block street fair featuring food, music, arts and crafts and, of course, a host of corporate sponsors.

“I’m actually from Alaska and just kind of wandered into it — I followed my nose,” said Ron Krause, an oil worker who traveled to San Diego to attend the AMA Supercross motorcycle race at Petco Park on Saturday night.

“I’m not exactly sure what it is, but I like this kind of thing,” said Krause, who was working on a plateful of pork ribs at mid-morning.

The food, games and crafts also lured the Martinez family of Logan Heights. Cynthia Martinez packed up her sons, Joshua and Freddy, first thing in the morning and headed downtown.

“We really like to know about the different cultures,” she said. “It’s not every day I get to experience a parade,” Joshua said.

Chinese people have been celebrating the lunar new year, or spring festival, for more than 4,000 years. The Chinese community in San Diego and across the world this year are celebrating the Year of the Rat, the first of the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac and one that represents good fortune, personality and surplus.

Peter Chu, president of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, the nonprofit that is hosting the two-day celebration, said the Lunar New Year is the most important holiday in the Chinese culture.

“We are here to serve the community and this is an occasion for all of us to get together and enjoy the day,” he said. “This is a time for Chinese to reaffirm their kinship with each other, to come home and spend time with parents and grandparents.”

The celebration continues Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and is free to the public.

Scheduled events Sunday include a repeat performance by the Lucky Lion Dancers, the Lantern Parade at noon and a 4:10 p.m. concert by the San Diego flutist G-Moto.
