President Tsai Ing-wen broke election records, netting nearly 8.2 million votes (57.1%), more than any other Taiwanese president since the island’s first election in 1996.

She beat out Chinese-backed candidate Han Kuo-yu, mayor of the city of Kaoshiung, by more than 2.6 million votes. (Han received 38.6% of the votes. – James Soong of the People’s first party won 4.3% of the vote.)

“Taiwan is showing the world how much we cherish our free democratic way of life and how much we cherish our nation,” Ms. Tsai told reporters as she announced her victory shortly after her Kuomintang Party (KMT) rival Han Kuo-yu conceded defeat.

In her victory speech, President Tsai said:

“I would like to thank everyone who voted today regardless of how you voted. With each presidential election I want to show the world how much we value our democratic way of life and how much we value our nation, the democratic republic of Taiwan.”

Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party also won majority in parliament in the weekend election.

Tsai, who supports total independence from China, angered Beijing during her campaign by upholding Taiwan as an example of sovereignty during anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong.

The communist People’s Republic of China views Taiwan as a province, though it has been governed independently from China since 1949.

Tsai’s victory is expected to escalate tensions between her country and mainland China.

“I believe friends in Hong Kong will be happy about our collective decision tonight,” Tsai said Saturday. “We hope that the Beijing authorities can understand that a democratic Taiwan with a government chosen by the people will not give in to threats and intimidation.”

Han, meanwhile, wanted to see Taiwan and China “united.”

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo celebrated Tsai’s win, calling her a “force for good in the world.”

“The United States thanks President Tsai for her leadership in developing a strong partnership with the United States and applauds her commitment to maintaining cross-Strait stability in the face of unrelenting pressure,” Pompeo said in a statement.

The US is Taiwan’s strongest international ally and weapons supplier.
