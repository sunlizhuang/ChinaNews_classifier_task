Following weeks of major royal drama, which resulted in Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stepping down as full time working members of the royal family, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s official wedding memorabilia has been removed from the Royal Collection.

The Royal Collection is the largest private art collection in the world and is spread out among 13 occupied and historic royal residences in the United Kingdom. The collection is co-owned by Queen Elizabeth II and displays important memorabilia from historic moments in the lives of the British Royal family.

Items from Meghan and Harry's May 2018 wedding, including a fine bone china mug, plate and more, were a part of the Royal Collection for the past two years. Earlier this week, however, The Daily Mail reported those items had been removed from the collection.

“Many of Royal Collection Trust’s china ranges are produced to celebrate a specific occasion and are sold for a limited time,” a spokesperson for the Royal Collection Trust said in a statement after news broke Meghan and Harry's memorabilia had been removed. “The china range to celebrate the wedding of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex has sold out.”

Prince William and Kate Middleton, who wed in 2011, have also had their wedding memorabilia removed from the Royal Collection, as well. Princess Eugenie's memorabilia, however, is still available on the collection's website.
