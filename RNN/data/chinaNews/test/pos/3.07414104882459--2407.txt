Located in a remote part of Hunan province, Zhangjiajie has an almost mythical atmosphere. With thousands of pillar-like rock formations emerging from the swirling mist, the landscape looks uncannily like ancient Chinese ink-and-paper drawings.

This trip takes you to the area’s major attractions, such as Hallelujah Mountain that appears in the Hollywood blockbuster film Avatar, the Bailong Glass Elevator, which is the tallest and largest outdoor elevator in the world, and the Grand Canyon Glass Bridge, the longest glass bridge in China.

On your first day, your guides will meet you at the airport in Zhangjiajie and help to check you in to your hotel. Start your trip in Yuanjiajie, a scenic area that is popular for the Sky Pillar, which inspired the floating mountains in the movie Avatar. Journey onto Tianzi Mountain, where you will find yourself marveling at the magnificence of China’s ancient skyline that inspired generations of painters. You can explore the area by riding the mountain tram or simply walking around.
