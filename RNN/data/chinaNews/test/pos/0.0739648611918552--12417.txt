WASHINGTON, D.C. – Navajo Nation leaders see see economic opportunities in the China Phase One Trade Agreement signed on Wednesday. In fact, Navajo Nation Vice President Myron Lizer was in attendance at the White House signing ceremony.

On Wednesday, President Trump signed off on the agreement that requires structural reforms to China’s economic and trade regime in the areas of intellectual property, technology transfer, agriculture, financial services, and currency and foreign exchange.

Lizer joined Trump as well as Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, Beijing’s chief negotiator for the agreement, and business leaders for the ceremony held in the East Room of the White House.

Agreement to provide safeguards counterfeit items that are marketed as authentic Navajo jewelry, and allow the Navajo Nation to capitalize on its economic potential

The Chinese government has described the agreement as one “based on the principle of equality and mutual respect.”

The agreement also includes a commitment by China to future purchases of U.S. goods and services in the coming years.

“The reopening of the Chinese agricultural market is a win, not only for the economies of the United States and the Navajo Nation, but for the global economy. Currently, the Navajo Agricultural Products Industry, an enterprise of the Navajo Nation, has more than 8,200 acres of crop production specifically designated for export to Asian markets,” said Vice President Lizer in a press release.

“This historic agreement has the potential to allow the Navajo Nation to capitalize on our economic potential through increased agricultural production. The trade agreement will expand the Navajo Nation’s ability to court investments in Navajo products. This trade agreement goes a long way in strengthening our economy, government, and ultimately it benefits the members of the Navajo Nation. The signing of the United States and China Phase 1 trade agreement ensures that the United States of America continues to be a forward-thinking Nation and remains a global economic leader,” Lizer added.

“We are optimistic that the intellectual property portion of the agreement will provide some relief and safeguards to deter the selling of counterfeit items that are marketed as authentic Navajo jewelry, when in fact they are counterfeit and produced overseas. Our Navajo silversmiths and artists are very talented and gifted and they deserve to be protected against producers that try to sell counterfeit Navajo jewelry on the open market,” added Vice President Lizer.
