Japan's government will pump millions into aid projects in Vanuatu ahead of the country's forthcoming election as part of a $100 million bid to shore up influence in the Pacific nations.

The funding supports the goal, set out in a regional meeting convened by Japan in 2018, to “achieve resilient and sustainable development” in the Pacific Islands including health, by “enhancing co-operation” to raise the quality of medical services “and the welfare of the people in the Pacific".

Japan will send $8 million to Vanuatu later this year to purchase a mobile clinic to improve medical care in the island nation's rural and remote areas, the Japanese government has confirmed.

Tokyo’s funding for medical care and sanitation follows US$64 million ($94 million) from 2011 to 2017 in aid from Tokyo for the Port Vila Lapetasi International Wharf Development Project, and $US23 million for school upgrades and renovation, according to data compiled by Lowy Institute.
