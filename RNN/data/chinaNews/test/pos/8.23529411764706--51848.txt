Laursen, who has substantial experience in the digital humanities, has incorporated digital tools such as API, ArcGIS StoryMaps and photogrammetry into her exhibitions and teaching, seeking new ways to increase audience engagement, reveal patterns in art historical data and improve accessibility for visitors with disabilities.

Since arriving at Middlebury in 2013, Laursen has organized a reinstallation of the college�s Robert F. Reiff Gallery of Asian Art and curated the exhibitions �Shadow Lands: China through the Lens of Michael Cherney� in 2014, �The Art of Storytelling: Five Tales from Asia,� �Then and Now� in 2015 and �Perseverance: Japanese Tattoo Tradition in a Modern World� in 2016, as well as three forthcoming exhibitions that will open at Middlebury in 2020.

Laursen received her Bachelor of Arts in art history and East Asian studies from New York University in 2002 and her Master of Arts and Ph.D. from the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations at the University of Pennsylvania in 2005 and 2011 respectively.

In her role at the Harvard Art Museums, Laursen will join the Division of Asian and Mediterranean Art. She will primarily be responsible for the care, documentation, research and presentation of the museums� collection of Chinese art, working closely with division colleagues and museum supporters to expand the collection. Laursen will also contribute to the care and presentation of the museums� Korean art and Buddhist art collections. Additionally, she will collaborate with colleagues in the Division of Modern and Contemporary Art on the acquisition and presentation of contemporary works of Chinese art.

�We are delighted to welcome Sarah to our museums after an extensive search for a Chinese art curator who will truly thrive in this environment and working with this collection,� said Director Martha Tedeschi. �Her talents and experience as a curator and teacher, along with her creativity and passion, will enliven and strengthen the Harvard Art Museums� impact in the field of Chinese art history.�

In conjunction with crafting an exhibition, research and publication program for the objects in her care, Laursen will collaborate with Harvard students and faculty to foster use of the collection for both undergraduate and graduate teaching. As part of the museums� own teaching and research objectives, she will also work closely with curatorial fellows and interns.

�I am humbled and excited to return to the Harvard Art Museums, which have shaped my experience of art history since my first visit in high school,� said Laursen. �While participating in the inventory project supported by the Carpenter Foundation, I had an opportunity to glimpse the breadth of the Chinese collection and scratch the surface of its storied past. Today, I am thrilled at the prospect of delving deeper into the study of these extraordinary objects and to find innovative ways to share them with the Harvard community, the greater Boston area and the world.�
