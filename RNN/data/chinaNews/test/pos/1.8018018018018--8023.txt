CROOKSTON, Minn. â€” A northwest Minnesota farmer and legislator is headed to Washington, D.C., this week for the signing of the first phase of a new trade deal between the United States and China.

Minnesota state Rep. Debra Kiel, R-Crookston, was asked by the White House to attend the signing on Wednesday, Jan. 15. Kiel farms near Crookston and says soybeans are front and center in the deal and that it will mean much-needed relief for farmers in the region.

"This will open up markets that we can sell soybeans that are in our bins right now at a better price, " Keil said. "(It) will help cushion the loss of agriculture this last year."

The representative said if farmers can unload their soybeans, it could be an economic boost for northwest Minnesota.
