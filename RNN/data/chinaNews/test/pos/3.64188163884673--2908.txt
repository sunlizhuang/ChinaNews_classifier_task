Tributes have been paid to ‘inspiring’ Theatre Royal Bury St Edmunds boss Karen Simpson who has died after battling cancer.

Karen, 62, was the venue’s chief executive and artistic director for more than six years and turned around its flagging fortunes, while reconnecting it with the community in her vision to create a theatre for all.

She announced in early December that she would be stepping down to spend more time with family and friends having lived with an incurable cancer diagnosis for two and a half years.

However, her health declined more rapidly than expected and she passed away peacefully on Saturday (January 4) surrounded by her family. Karen leaves her husband Tony Kelly and daughters Sammy, Katie and Jenny.

Roger Quince, chairman of the Theatre Royal board, said: “This is indeed an extremely sad day for myself, Adrian Grady and all staff, volunteers and cast.

“Karen will be sorely missed as both a colleague and a friend. Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with Tony and the girls.”

Karen joined the Theatre Royal in 2013 when it faced significant financial difficulties and was in danger of closing.

She helped return the venue to a sustainable position and grew its audiences year on year.

Other achievements saw her direct the annual pantomime, produce work that reached into schools and communities and she directed Roy Hudd in a production of Goodnight Mister Tom.

Before Theatre Royal, Karen was artistic director of two touring companies as well as education and creative development director for The Crucible, in Sheffield.
