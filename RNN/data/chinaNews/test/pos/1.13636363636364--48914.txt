UK nationals who have been evacuated from Wuhan have described the Arrowe Park Hospital, where they are being held in quarantine, as “like an hotel”.

Currently, 83 Brits are being held at Arrowe Park, on the Wirral, until doctors can determine whether they are infected with 2019-nCoV, popularly known as coronavirus.

They are expected to be staying at the facility for 14 days, with a further group of 11 evacuees expected to arrive later today.

Footage sent to 5 news producer Eleanor Gregory shows the patients talking happily about the bag of essentials they were given on arrival.

One evacuee, Matt Raw said: "There's a bag here containing various essentials we might need, underwear and things people might not have had time to pack.

"It's a perfectly nice room, we've got all the essentials we need. We do have a concierge here who is attending to our absolute every need. It's like staying in a hotel.

He added: "Imagine the best hotel you've ever stayed in and the best service you could ever possibly imagine – these guys at the NHS wipe the floor with the lot of them.

"Anything we've asked for, TVs, hair dryers they go out and obtain them for us in a flash.”

There is currently no cure for the virus, but Thai doctors have revealed promising results from using a combination of flu and HIV medication.

Latest figures from Public Health England say that, in the UK, 266 people in total have been tested for the virus. Two tests have proven positive.

Between January 10 and 24, 1,466 passengers and 95 aircrew arrived in the UK on direct flights from Wuhan. Of those, 162 of the passengers and 56 of the aircrew have already left the UK.

866 are believed to be outside the virus’s incubation period. Public Health England are working to contact the remaining passengers.

Official government advice is for anyone who has recently arrived from China to isolate themselves and call 111 for advice.
