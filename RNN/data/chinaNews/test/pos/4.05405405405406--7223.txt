Bullring and Grand Central is set to host a 'dazzling' Festival of Light attraction later this month.

The free event will transform the centre’s outdoor spaces including Rotunda Square, St Martin’s Walk and St Martin’s Square with five 'spectacular installations' as part of Birmingham's Chinese New Year celebrations.

What's more the event, which runs from Friday January 24 to Sunday February 2, is completely free to attend.

Danielle Bozward, Marketing Manager at Bullring and Grand Central, said: “Following the success of last year’s event we’re excited to bring back Festival of Light with these five new installations.

"What better way to light up a dark January evening than a light festival!”

There will be additional Chinese New Year with events taking place in-centre on Saturday Janury 25.

Shoppers can follow a lion and dragon procession through the centre and watch pop-up performances including traditional fan and umbrella dances.

There will also be a special Wish Tree in Grand Central for shoppers and travellers to add their new year wishes to. The Festival of Light takes place daily from 5pm.

This is part of the many Chinese New Year activities taking place across the city, including lots of fun things to do around Chinatown. The celebrations start on Friday January 24 with a Chinese classical concert presented by the University of Birmingham at the Bramall. Take a look at our guide here to find out more.
