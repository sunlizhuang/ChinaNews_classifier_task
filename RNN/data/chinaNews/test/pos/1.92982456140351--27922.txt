Coonan and new chief executive Ken Barton now have more of that than they can handle – no less than four separate inquiries, headlined by the NSW government’s public probe into the sale of a stake in Crown by James Packer to Lawrence Ho’s Melco Resorts. Packer, Ho and Alexander himself have already been called as witnesses.

Showing her background as a Liberal senator, Coonan neatly side-stepped a question as to whether she and Barton would bring a different style to that of Alexander.

“We could talk about vision for the business and what we want to do with it, but in terms of style I think the best way to describe it is that we want stability,” Coonan told Chanticleer. “We've all got a deep knowledge of the business and connection to it and I think that stability is very important as we face some fairly serious challenges.”

But Coonan and Barton will surely give Crown a more open public persona. Just as Crown needed a modern governance structure, it also needs a modern approach to engagement.

Supportive, but not involved

Coonan was also keen to make clear that it was the independent directors of Crown – Coonan, Professor John Horvath, Andrew Demetriou, Jane Halton, Antonia Korsanos, Harold Mitchell and John Poynton – who, in her words, “stepped up” and ran the process to restructure the board.

Packer is supportive, but was not involved. Minority shareholders, who according to Coonan were explicit in their desire for change, seem pleased with the splitting of the chairman and CEO roles, and somewhat relieved Alexander is stepping down.

An independent chair will also be important if Lawrence Ho is allowed to complete his deal with Packer and move to own 19.99 per cent of Crown, and potentially more in the future. It’s doubtful Melco would have been thrilled having someone who has historically been close to Packer running the joint with such a level of power.

Of course, Ho being allowed to remain a Crown shareholder is up in the air. The NSW inquiry will probe the relationship between Ho and his father Stanley, who has long being accused of having links to organised crime in his home in Macau. Ho senior has always denied those links, and Ho junior has long argued his father has no influence over his business affairs.

And Melco now has a fight on a new front, with revelations its offices in Japan were raided by government officials amid a broader local bribery probe involving a Chinese firm. Melco has been working for years towards securing a licence to build one of Japan’s first integrated casinos and resorts, and at first blush the raids look like a blow.

Meanwhile, Barton has another bit of bad luck to deal with.

In addition to wading through four regulatory inquiries, completing the new Barangaroo casino in Sydney ahead of its December opening and managing Crown’s existing Melbourne and Perth properties through what is likely to be an extended period of poor consumer spending, Barton now faces a potential black swan event in the form of the coronavirus.

Barton told Chanticleer that Crown is working on its response, with plenty of help from federal government agencies. But there will be an impact, given Wuhan is a city of 11 million, and they travel.

“We didn’t need another challenge, but we’ve got one.”
