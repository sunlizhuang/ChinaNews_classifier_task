Norwich — The Norwich Free Academy board of trustees Finance Committee got a preview of the 2020-21 budget process Thursday, including a preliminary projected 3 percent tuition increase for the partner districts.

Head of School David Klein outlined for the committee what will be his final NFA budget, as he will depart in June to become principal of St. Joseph High School in Trumbull.

Klein said that, for planning purposes, the committee should consider a 3 percent tuition increase but said it doesn’t mean that will be the final figure, as NFA administrators pull together all the department budgets, contractual obligations and finalize enrollment projections for the coming year.

The board also will ask the NFA Foundation at its Jan. 21 meeting for a tuition subsidy from the private fundraising arm’s coffers. Last year, the foundation contributed $1.2 million for tuition relief and also awarded a $550,000 unrestricted grant to the board of trustees, which followed last year’s Finance Committee recommendation to apply the grant to tuition relief, as well.

Klein said it’s too early to calculate tuition amounts and budget totals. Administrators asked department heads to make “flat” budget requests for the coming year, and to spell out the need for any increases. Lucinda Finger, director of finance and human resources, told the committee that based on a new three-year contract with the NFA teachers’ union, teachers’ salaries will rise 3.04 percent next year. Health insurance costs could jump by 6.7 percent, based on preliminary estimates.

Enrollment projections also factor into the budget. In last year’s budget, NFA projected enrollment of 2,257, and the actual number as of now is 2,260, Klein said. Key to enrollment projections is the estimate for the incoming ninth grade class. Last year, the projected pool of eighth graders from the eight sending towns, the Integrated Day Charter School and Norwich’s two Catholic grammar schools totaled 665 students. Of those, 535, or 80 percent, came to NFA, the remaining going to other designated high schools, magnet or parochial schools.

However, the projected total pool for next year has shrunk by 39 students to 626. NFA also is keeping track of the students from outside the partner district area who are considering NFA, and the academy has about 50 international students.

Klein will meet next week with a Stamford-based firm that works with mainly Chinese families interested in sending their children to schools in the United States. He said the academy already works with one small firm that places international students and could add the second firm.

The Finance Committee will meet a few times before administrators present the committee's proposed budget to the full board of trustees on Jan. 28.

The committee also will be working on a new five-year master agreement between NFA and the partner districts. The current agreement expires at the end of June. School boards in Norwich, Preston and Canterbury notified the academy in 2018 that they would like to negotiate changes in the agreement.

But the three partner districts have yet to provide NFA with details of any proposed changes. NFA board Chairman DeVol Joyner said he sent letters to the Norwich, Preston and Canterbury boards last week seeking their proposed changes in the contract. Once those issues are received, officials from NFA and the three towns will have an idea whether negotiations will be straightforward or more complex.

Once negotiations with the three towns are completed, NFA will propose one universal contract to cover all partner districts.
