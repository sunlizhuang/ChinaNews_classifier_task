ISPENT most of last weekend defending. My phone has been flooded with images of the superstar dressed in a polka-dotted shirt, a matching pair of visors and clown pants. Rude words followed that don’t belong in a family newspaper, but one can follow the actor or his team’s social media pages for a gist of the incivilities. Ican only imagine Ranveer laughing the loudest at pranking us with his sartorial silliness.The actor’s new getup was witnessed at the newestin the country: the airport. Ranveer is dressed in one of his favourite designers –Sabyasachi – who has two major announcements in one week; a tie-up with New York’s legendary department store (it even has a novel named after it) Bergdorf Goodman, and another with the retail mammoth H&M. Singh and Sabya wanted eyeballs and, boy, did they get them.But more importantly, Singh’s avatar heralds a new time for the Indian man. His unmanly ensemble stands for someone who is rejecting traditionally-held notions of masculinity. Of course, you can wear a shirt and trousers, or jeans and a t-shirt, but what if you don’t fit in? Or don’t want to fit in? Singh stands for men who aren’t conventionally masculine, who don’t fit into a box, but can be as successful as him and be married to the most beautiful woman in the country. Ranveer Singh is the modern man’s messiah, their acche din.“In India, where patriarchy decides everything, women are the biggest casualty. But one must not forget that several men are the victims of patriarchy, too,”tells me. “In traditional joint families, rules and roles have been decided for men. Men must not cry, must not show emotion, must not show weakness. Ranveer gives these men the courage to break free.”Sabyasachi has long been the pioneer of gender-fluid fashion in India. Even beforepresented his gender-fluid show for Gucci five years ago – whenbecame legal across the USA –Sabyasachi was dressing his men in florals. His ‘Big Love’ collection from seven years ago upended the idea that men’s prints must be checks or stripes only. “Florals for men are the new normcore now,” he avers.The designer says Ranveer is dressing how men will be dressing in another decade. “Historically, what he is wearing in this image is a very masculine silhouette. It’s a pirate’s shirt worn with striped trousers in mashru. We have narrowed down menswear only recently to shirts and trousers. But then why is the dhoti so similar to the nauvari sari?”Singh has been dressing androgynously for over five years now. He is such a macho beefcake personally but he can easily carry off a softer and more feminine outfit. His current fashion choices are especially on point with international men’s fashion.Atearlier this month,(for Dior) showed men as the new dandy. His male models wore pearl earrings, elbow-length velvet gloves, rosettes and fringes, and taffeta swing coats. Jones is trying to destigmatise certain clothing codes and fabric associations for men. Popular label Off-White by Virgil Abloh had surrealist prints of household items for its men’s line. Maison Valentino byhad a little poetic gravitas with textured suits and floral embroideries. Dries Van Noten showed men at their decadent best, with rhinestone silks, printed velvet pants and excessive silhouettes.Especially in the last year, and certainly as the aftermath to #MeToo, ‘toxic masculinity’ has become a favourite catchphrase for media as well as fashion. A new kind of male model or icon has emerged, bringing with him a new definition of handsome. The delicate, elfin, new boy-man is described as ‘little fresh meat’ across China and Asia. With an appeal that worked for both genders, he is hugely marketable for fashion and beauty brands.Gucci, which is often credited for starting this fire, last week brought out aline that went back to the essence of men: when they were boys. Michele showed jeans with grass stains, knicker-boxers and knee-high socks to showcase a boy’s childhood when he wasn’t tainted by society’s ideas of masculinity. Michele also has a t-shirt with the word ‘impotent’ emblazoned on it. Gucci’s press release says, “Toxic masculinity, in fact, nourishes abuse, violence, and sexism. And not only that. It condemns men themselves to conform to an imposed phallic virility in order to be socially accepted.” In other words, patriarchy is dead.Queer-friendly heroes are not new: David Bowie and Prince appealed to both men and women. Ranveer Singh has masterfully made his fashionpushing flamboyance his schtick. In a visual age, where Instagram is the biggest tastemaker, he who makes the optics takes the cake.But most importantly, Ranveer says the world needs to broaden its horizon on who gets to wear what.Tweets:
