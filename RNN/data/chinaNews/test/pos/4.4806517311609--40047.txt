Nestlé International Travel Retail (NITR) has partnered with Lagardère Travel Retail for a Chinese New Year KitKat activation at Singapore Changi Airport Terminal 2.

The space was secured following a competitive pitch and provides a festive twist on KitKat’s Very Important Break (VIB) Lounge concept.

Last year, NITR also partnered with Lagardère in Singapore Changi Terminal 2 for a high-profile promotion (HPP) around the KitKat Bus activation, as reported by this publication. The HPP began on 2 May 2019 and continued until the end of June.

The Chinese New Year activation is running throughout January and February 2020 and provides a ‘fun and playful twist’ on the airport lounge, according to the company.

It includes a VIB Lounge interactive display, KitKat Senses Dessert Counter sampling station, KitKat floor graphics and a centrepiece. The latter is a disruptive gold on red ‘moon gate’ shaped feature which draws attention to a back-wall screen displaying details of Chinese New Year promotional offers and festive messages.

EXCLUSIVE DISCOUNT

Promotional messages are reinforced by a hanging Chinese-style banner highlighting an exclusive 20% discount on selected KitKat products including KitKat Chunky and Share Bags.

Engagement is encouraged by the VIB Lounge interactive display at the front of the lounge space. Customers are invited to ‘upgrade’ by pressing a button, which gives the user a KitKat-branded lucky red envelope (traditional for Chinese New Year) and ways to #LiveYourBreak through games, music and GWPs.

The aforementioned KitKat London red bus is also appearing as part of the campaign. This has been used in various activations at airports including London Heathrow, Singapore Changi and Dubai International.

Designed to promote the KitKat range, the bus has a small seat for selfie opportunities behind the wheel. It also incorporates a digital interactive screen allowing customers to select videos to play and/or write a personal message on the screen.

NITR General Manager Stewart Dryburgh said: “The bold branding which blends KitKat red and Chinese New Year gold allows us to really stand out in the busy airport environment. We are delighted with this activation, which enabled us to engage consumers in this key retail space in Terminal 2 at the amazing Singapore Changi Airport.

“This disruptive campaign is a great example of how NITR is increasing the profile of our no.1 brand KitKat in travel retail. It also helps to kick start what we are confident will be another successful year for Nestlé ITR, building on our ‘10 in 10’ strategy to double sales of the food and confectionery category to $10bn in the next 10 years.”
