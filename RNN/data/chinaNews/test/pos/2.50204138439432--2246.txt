Political advisers in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, called on Tuesday for enhanced youth exchanges between the city and Hong Kong to help overcome problems in the financial hub and also fuel the further growth of its mainland neighbor.

The Shenzhen municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the city's political advisory body, started its annual meeting on Tuesday.

A key focus of its members is how to promote youth exchanges among the Chinese mainland, and the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions.

Dai Beifang, chairman of the standing committee, said in his work report that the city's political advisory body will make greater efforts on guiding members to firmly support the SAR governments and chief executives in carrying out law-based governance, and actively participate in the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

It will also play a more active role in promoting youth exchanges among Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Macao, he said.

John Ma Hung-ming, a member of Shenzhen CPPCC who is also vice-chairman of Hong Kong-listed catering service provider Carrianna Holdings, said the Bay Area blueprint, which was officially launched in February, provides huge opportunities for Hong Kong people, as they can develop their careers in a much larger market.

He suggested that deeper exchanges should be carried out not only among young people in Shenzhen and Hong Kong, but also among professionals from the two cities.

Jamie Sze Wine-him, vice-chairman of All-China Youth Federation, echoed his view. Shenzhen enterprises should offer more internship opportunities to young people from Hong Kong and Macao and set up a joint program on cultivating youth talents, he said.

Sze also suggested that more Hong Kong and Macao students should be admitted to mainland universities.

Witman Hung Wai-man, principal liaison officer for Hong Kong of the Shenzhen Qianhai Authority, highlighted the importance of improving infrastructure and providing a sound business environment in attracting talent from Hong Kong and Macao.

"We don't need every young person from Hong Kong to be willing to go to Shenzhen at the current time. As long as Shenzhen has a developed infrastructure and pleasant business environment, the first group of young people from Hong Kong will make their careers here. When they are successful, more and more will follow in their footsteps," he said.
