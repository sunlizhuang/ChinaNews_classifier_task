, but we don't sell those bulbs and are recommending high-output Halogen bulbs instead. Why? Because retrofit LED's (for vehicles not factory-equipped with LED headlamps) aren't quite ready for prime time yet. There's a reason why the major bulb suppliers (such as Hella and Sylvania/Osram) are not offering them yet, but off-brand Chinese companies are. The beam pattern tends to be irregular (either blinding oncoming traffic, or not illuminating the road evenly), and reliability, QC, and lifespan are inconsistent. (Also they don't generate heat so they're poorly suited for cold weather; they won't melt snow that hits your headlights.) At this time we are not recommending switching to LED, but when that time comes all you have to do is plug in LED bulbs in place of the included halogen ones, it's that simple. By the time the halogen bulbs burn out it may be time to go LED, but if not, replacements are only $8 a pair and are a huge improvement over what you're using now.



anyway, ymmv

as a 61 year oldbiker, i like to see at nite. so i have tried a fair number of hid and led bulbs in my bikes (as led bulbs are very efficient, it is a real advantage to be able to run them on a bike where power is limited). i do a pretty thorough evaluation of each as i am looking to IMPROVE my lighting. as such, while i like the whiteness of led lighting and generally could live with the patterns and coverage, i find myself returning to the higher end halogen bulbs. i do have a pair of Hella E code reflectors in my 96 van and use Piaa Night Tech H4 bulbs supplemented with Piaa 004 driving lights go here .(you can see EVERYTHING 1/2mi+ down the road when they are on). the issue to me is due to the bulb/reflector relation. i don't feel that the replacement led bulbs emit light in the same place as a halogen so the subsequent beam pattern is compromised. were the bulb and reflector designed as a pair as they are on new cars, then i think you would have an excellent lamp. check out Daniel stern's website. and here is a read from the bus stop (vw bus dudes) on their page selling the Cibie h4 reflectors - hella h4 equivalent
