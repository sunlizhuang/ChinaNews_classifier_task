Representing intelligence, vitality and flexibility, the rat is the first Chinese zodiac sign. These qualities are embodied in the witty mouse from the legendary Tom And Jerry cartoons.

Kate Spade New York celebrates the Lunar New Year with a collection inspired by the playful relationship between the classic cartoon duo.

Jerry, the smart brown house mouse, peeks from his favourite hiding place on accessories that also feature the brand's classic silhouettes and signature spade floral motif.

This year also marks the 80th anniversary of Tom And Jerry, created by animators William Hanna and Joseph Barbera for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM).

The conflict, chase and action commenced from the very first short, titled Puss Gets The Boot, released on Feb 10, 1940. The animation series continued, with several episodes winning Academy Awards, and later became a TV hit with spin-off films.

The rivalry between the mischievous rodent and its feline arch enemy is being interpreted in Warner Bros' live-action/animation hybrid film, set for release in December 2020.
