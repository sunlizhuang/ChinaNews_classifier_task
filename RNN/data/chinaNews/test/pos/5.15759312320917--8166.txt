The Chinese Cultural Troupe is in the country for a number of performances as one way of promoting cultural exchange between Malawi and China.

The Sichuan Province Song and Dance Theatre, which arrived through Chileka International Airport in Blantyre yesterday afternoon, is scheduled to start its engagements today with a performance at Malawi University of Science and Technology (Must) in Thyolo.

The group’s visit to Malawi coincides with the Chinese New Year, according to the Lunar Calendar, when they celebrate one of their oldest and most important cultural events, the Spring Festival.

Ministry of Sports, Youth and Culture spokesperson Simon Mbvundula said the ministry is happy to host the Chinese Cultural Troupe as it presents an opportunity to embrace and celebrate cultural diversity.

He said: “Culture is dynamic and we should strive to learn from one another. Such cultural exchange programmes help both countries to showcase their various rich cultural heritage.”

He said culture paves way for human-centred, inclusive and equitable development, adding that there is no sustainable development which can be achieved without culture. He said through the same partnerships, some Malawian groups have previously had the opportunity to perform in China.

He also said that during its performances, the Chinese group will be joined by other local acts such as Sambang’oma Dance Troupe who will perform at Must while the National Dance Troupe and Hear Us Children from Music Crossroads will perform at Bingu International Convention Centre.

According to information from Chinese Embassy in Malawi, the Chinese Spring Festival is an event which is used to share the Chinese culture and build a harmonious world with the country’s friends all over the world.

The Sichuan Province Song and Dance Troupe is a State-run literature and art troupe founded in 1953. It has several divisions, including Song and Dance Troupe, Arts Performance Centre, Training Centre and National Asset Management Centre, among others. The group is expected to be in the country until January 17 this year.
