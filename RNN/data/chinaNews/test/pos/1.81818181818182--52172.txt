(TAP) - Ambassador of People's Republic of China to Tunisia Wang Weinbin said 20,471 people in his country have contracted new coronavirus until February 4 at around 2:30 PM (Beijing time).

At a press conference held Tuesday at the Chinese embassy in Tunis, Weinbin said 16 foreign nationals living in China tested positive. Two of them recovered while the rest are in stable condition, he pointed out. They were quarantined so as to receive the appropriate medical treatment, the ambassador added.

The Chinese ambassador stressed that China’s top priority now is “to stop the spread of the virus at home and abroad,” adding that “Beijing has mobilised all necessary means to ensure the safety of its citizens and expatriates living in China”. “Six billion dollars funds have been dedicated to fight coronavirus until Monday, February 3,” the ambassador emphasised.

He added that the Chinese government has published all preventive measures and recommendations against coronavirus in several languages including English, French, Russian, German, Japanese and Korean.

The Chinese ambassador said “China expresses deep thanks to the government of Tunisia and the Tunisian people for their support and understanding during this critical period China is going through. This should not last very long and will not affect bilateral cooperation and joint projects”.
