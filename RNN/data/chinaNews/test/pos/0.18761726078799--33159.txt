Fears about the impact of coronavirus on future demand for high-end wine in China - the company's most profitable market - also contributed to the sharp sell-off.

Mr Clarke, who will be departing by mid-2020 in a handover to chief operating officer Tim Ford, was philosophical about the share price plunge.

"It motivates me and Tim to get this back to the place that it needs to be,'' he said.

But there are sceptics who doubt the volatile US wine business can deliver consistent long-term returns.

A previous misstep in 2013 claimed the scalp of then chief executive David Dearie, and caused Treasury to use steamrollers to crush thousands of bottles of cheap wine which had built up in distributor warehouses in the US.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst David Errington asked Mr Clarke on Wednesday ''why do you keep throwing money at it?'', when the main profit centre was the better-performing Australian business which exports vast amounts of Penfolds to China.

Mr Clarke and Mr Ford defended the long-term future of the US operations.

"We have hit a speed bump at the moment in this year and we're going to address that,'' Mr Clarke said.

The trade war between the US and China means that large amounts of wine from US producers which were destined for China are now staying in their home market.

A bigger-than-expected 2019 Californian vintage also prompted large wine producers to suddenly switch to private label products and offer ''exclusive'' labels to retail chains, which leapt on the better profits they can make from those brands.

Mr Clarke said there had been a sudden shift, and it meant the company would accelerate a strategic review which was almost complete. It would result in a much smaller commercial wine business at Treasury, and an internal separation in which the commercial brands would be run under one unit to sharpen their focus on lifting returns.

"We need a separate focus on luxury, and a separate focus on commercial,'' he said.

Separation of luxury and commercial

Mr Clarke said there was unlikely to be a demerger but the internal separation would ensure those involved in the commercial wines division were more accountable, rather than relying on the better-performing luxury brands such as Penfolds to make all the running.

"That's what requires us to address that human behaviour,'' he said. "We're going to have to right-size commercial even more.''

Final decisions were likely by the end of June, with extensive work having been completed in previous years as Treasury had already wrestled with the long-term shifts in the global wine market.

"We do know the answers,'' Mr Clarke said. "We're going to move quickly on this''.

He said the speed of the build-up in excess wine in the US had caught all players by surprise. Some large rivals, including Constellation Brands, were now planning to exit the wine industry.

Some of Treasury's commercial brands affected in the US include Beringer Coastal and Beringer Main & Vine.

Treasury surprised investors by putting out a preliminary set of first-half results to the ASX on Tuesday night which detailed the extent of the problems in the US, but re-affirmed that growth in China had been robust.

Treasury's Americas region reported a 17 per cent decline in earnings before interest, tax and the SGARA agricultural accounting standard for the first half of 2019-20, to $98.3 million.

Profit margins in the Americas slumped to 16.1 per cent from 19.7 per cent a year ago.

Mr Clarke said on Wednesday he was still confident that profit margins in the US business would eventually reach 25 per cent. Treasury was ''rolling up its sleeves'' to fix the US issues.

Treasury warned that it now expects to deliver full-year earnings growth of between 5 per cent to 10 per cent, instead of the previously announced range of 15 per cent to 20 per cent.

The company also cut its profit growth expectations for 2020-21 to between 10 per cent and 15 per cent.

Treasury shares had already dropped by 5.8 per cent to $16.68 on Tuesday, largely because of fears over the coronavirus outbreak in China and what affect it might have on its most profitable market.

But the huge share plunge on Wednesday indicated investors have bigger concerns about the company.

Coronavirus fallout

Mr Clarke said it was too early to make any predictions about China. He cautioned that doomsayers predicting Hong Kong wine sales would slide because of the ongoing riots had been proven wrong. "It's not always correct just to join the dots."

Mr Ford said he was a big believer in the future of the US wine business. "We have improved that business over multiple years,'' he said. "It will succeed in my view."

Mr Clarke relocated to California for much of 2018 to oversee high-risk changes to the way Treasury distributed its wine in major US states, in a strategic shift he said would ultimately lead to higher margins.

Mr Ford said the business in Florida had outperformed the market after the changes, but California ''remained a work in progress''.

Treasury said its Asian business had produced earnings growth of 19 per cent to $176 million and profit margins had improved by 4.2 percentage points to 43.1 per cent.

Total net profit after tax for the six months ended December 31, 2019, was 5.1 per cent higher at $229.2 million.

Dollard under the hammer

Last month Treasury revealed it had been forced to reshuffle its North American executive ranks after one of its brightest young executives, Angus McPherson, bowed out of running the US business due to "unforeseen personal circumstances''.

Treasury hired outsider Ben Dollard as president of the Americas operations as his replacement.

Mr Ford said that Mr Dollard had ''hit the ground running'' this month.

Mr Dollard is an Australian who had been working for Constellation Brands in the US.
