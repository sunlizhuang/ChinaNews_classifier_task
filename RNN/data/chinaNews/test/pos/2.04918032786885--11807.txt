Shen Yun gave 14 performances in seven different cities on Saturday, Jan. 11, and audiences are saying the performance provides a deeper personal experience than just witnessing a beautiful display.

It’s “transcendent, just transcending. Its mind body spirit, everything,” says former Broadway actress Tami Damiano from San Jose, California.

“The aura, what it sort of gives you, the sort of overall emotion,” exclaims Mike Jones, an executive board member at the GFM Institute of Education, after seeing the performance in Woking, U.K.

Anchor Wakaka Sekine described her experience as, “I got chills all over my body, moved to tears.” after seeing Shen Yun in Tokyo, Japan.

“It was very, very powerful,” said Lee Ellis. Ellis is an award-winning author, and a retired United States Air Force Colonel. After watching the Shen Yun performance in Atlanta, Georgia, he said the show “Causes you to think about who you are, what your purpose is, and how do we deal with life on this earth.”

While most performing arts groups that stick to traditional techniques struggle to survive in the modern age, Shen Yun continues to grow. This year, Shen Yun has expanded from six to seven dance companies that travel simultaneously around the world.

Shen Yun is on a mission to revive the traditional values that were once the core of ancient Chinese culture and share this with the rest of the world.

“There’s something about this culture that resonates, I think deeply in people all over the world because it’s the same values,” shares emcee Leeshai Lemish. “It’s the same foundational idea…these principles that we’re depicting on stage…when people see the show, they reconnect with it.”

Ancient Chinese culture placed emphasis on divine and virtue. For thousands of years, classical Chinese dance was used to express those values.

“The values and history of a country I think are important for young people too,” said Princess Béatrice Marie Caroline Louise Françoise of Bourbon-Two Sicilies.

She saw Shen Yun for the second time in Naples, Italy. The first time she saw Shen Yun was in France.

“Young people must know history and have all these things, know them and be able to also practice them,” Princess Béatrice added.

Tami Damiano went on to share, “I thought that was a really beautiful mission that the situation the mind-body, spiritual mission, part of it that seems to have maybe been kind of squelched over the years that they were wanting to bring that back. I think that’s very important. It’s a crazy world we live in and, you know, I think we all need to remember that, at the heart at heart, we’re all the same. You know, that to keep your culture is so important because you don’t want to lose that part of what makes each culture unique”
