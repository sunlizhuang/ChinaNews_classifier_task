Feb 06, 2020 (LBO) – President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Thursday gifted a consignment of world-renowned Ceylon Black Tea to the Chinese Ambassador Cheng Xueyuan to be sent to those affected by the Coronavirus.

Ambassador Xueyuan on behalf of President Xi Jinping and the Government of the People’s Republic of China has thanked Sri Lanka for the kindness shown to China in this difficult moment.

President Rajapaksa in turn thanked the Ambassador for the assistance extended to bring back the Sri Lankan students from Wuhan province.

Upon the President’s inquiry as to the current status of the disease, the Ambassador explained in detail that the virus was detected soon after the Chinese New Year.

The Ambassador noted that since the Chinese New Year is not a holiday in Sri Lanka, most Chinese residing in Sri Lanka had not returned to China for the celebrations.

Those who did had been asked to delay their return to Sri Lanka and those who had already returned had been asked to impose self-isolation.

The virus which is a new strain had severely disrupted all economic and social activities in China and the surrounding region.

Sri Lanka too is affected by the loss of tourism and business activities. The top medic staff, including that in the Army, had been mobilized to research on this new virus and the Ambassador is hopeful of a breakthrough soon.
