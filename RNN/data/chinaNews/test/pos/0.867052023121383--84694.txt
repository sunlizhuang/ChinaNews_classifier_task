Chinese smartphone vendor Realme unveiled its first premium flagship smartphone, the X50 Pro, and outlined its strategy to build an ecosystem of 5G devices in a bid to broaden into new segments.

In a livestream, Realme Spain country manager Emilio Alvarez said “5G will be the next step” for the manufacturer as he pledged it will launch more than five compatible smartphones across all price segment this year. The vendor is also preparing to launch 20 products in the wearable, smart speakers, earphones and a category named “screens”, apparently relating to a move into the TV sector.

Its first wearable, the Realme Band, is due to launch next month.
