Zhaoting Xia sits at the front of her classroom at Cpl. Michael Middlebrook Elementary School in Lafayette, facing a group of kindergarteners while holding a basket of fake fruit and veggies in her lap.

The 29-year-old teacher holds paper copies of Chinese currency and invites kids up one at a time to use the "money" to purchase something from her pretend fruit stand.

All of this takes place in Chinese.

Xia is one of five Chinese immersion teachers at Middlebrook, home to the first such program in Louisiana. All five teachers are from China. Two are visiting teachers, like Xia, who can be contracted for up to three years. Two are local residents.

Louisiana's only other Chinese immersion program is offered at Baton Rouge Foreign Language Academic Immersion Magnet. LeBrun said it has a similar enrollment to Lafayette's program.

This year, the Lafayette program turns 10. It is serving 82 students from kindergarten through fifth grade.

One of them, a 5-year-old boy, picks out his money and greets Xia with "ni hao," starting the conversation as he has been taught. Then he works in some vocabulary words to ask for a plastic ear of corn.

She tells him the price, and he counts the money in his hand before making the exchange. They finish with "xiexie" or "thank you."

In this one exercise, they've practiced vocabulary, sentence structure, math and culture. Xia reminds her students to use appropriate greetings and how to behave in a situation in a potential real-world situation.

"You not only teach Chinese, but also other subjects," Xia said. "I teach them culture."

That's new to a lot 5-year-olds in Lafayette Parish, despite Acadiana's Asian population.

"A lot of people don't understand how big the Asian community is here in Acadiana," said Jessica Leonard, whose daughter is in first-grade Chinese immersion. "There is not just one Acadiana. This is one piece."

'Everything is new all the time'

On the same day Xia sells toy corn, fellow Middlebrook teacher Ting Ting Dong leads her second-graders in drawing Chinese characters. Students dip paintbrushes in water and practice each one. The water turns the gray paper black momentarily, but it quickly dries, allowing students to try again and again.

Both classrooms are papered with Chinese characters on posters and student work displayed on the wall. The only English words to be found are students' names on their desk and a sign that reads "Please speak Chinese" on Xia's door.

"Research has shown if you are exposed to a second language in childhood, especially in an education setting, you just become a better student — not necessarily smarter, but a better student," said Tia LeBrun, world language and immersion director for the Lafayette Parish School System. "It opens up access in your brain, because there is a greater number of connections made."

LeBrun said students in a language immersion program tend to be more empathetic and become natural leaders in their schools, among other benefits.

"They are more creative thinkers and better at problem solving, because they're solving problems all day long," LeBrun said. "They're trying to figure out the word they're being asked. Everything is new all the time."

Students make noticeable progress

Xia sees that struggle in her kindergarteners, especially at the beginning of the year when they are being exposed to Chinese usually for the first time.

"At the beginning it is very hard for them to understand or even know I'm from China," said Xia, who is from northeast China.

So the most important thing at the start of the school year is that her students listen to and watch her. As she speaks she uses gestures, an education technique called "Total Physical Response," and repeats everything. The strategies are important in both teaching content and classroom management.

"I need them to pay full attention," Xia said. "I give them a big smile, a thumbs-up when they are doing something right. I give them strict eyes when they are doing something wrong. While doing that, I also speak Chinese. They listen more and begin to associate with it the Chinese words."

She said her students don't speak much at the beginning or often share stories half in English and half in Chinese, but they are listening and building understanding. They gradually speak more and more, learning from Xia's consistent daily routine and lessons.

"The students can pick up language very, very fast in immersion," she said. "You can see they didn't know Chinese at all and now they do. You see the individual progress they make. It's amazing."

Principal Anne Herrmann said she has seen the program enhance students' learning.

"Even in kindergarten children are speaking in Chinese," Herrmann said. "It really builds their language and their understanding of different cultures. And it helps brain function."

Students in each grade level of the immersion program have an English teacher and a Chinese teacher, and they learn different content from each in those languages.

They learn Chinese language, math, science and social studies in Chinese — making their day 60% in the target language — and they take language arts and reading in English. Their enrichment areas, like P.E. or music, also are in English.

Lafayette was a prime spot for Chinese immersion

Belinda Zhou, who has lived in Lafayette since 1993, helped start the program. It began with one teacher and one kindergarten class at Alice Boucher Elementary School in 2009.

Her kids were in French immersion at Prairie Elementary School at the time, and one of the lead teachers told Zhou the district was considering adding another language immersion program.

Originally from southwest China and part of the Lafayette Chinese American Association, Zhou recommended Chinese. She said it made sense because of the population in the area and potential future job opportunities for students.

Plus, Lafayette was and is the right kind of place for Chinese immersion, she explained.

"Lafayette is a diverse society, diverse community," Zhou said. "It already has the deep culture of French and Spanish, deep rooted, too, so I think people here appreciate diversity of language and culture and a lot of us (Chinese Americans) live here longer. We consider here is our home."

She helped the district create the program, finding materials and textbooks, connecting with teachers, helping teachers find housing upon arrival and more.

In 2014, the program was moved to Middlebrook, then called Plantation Elementary. Today, it is one of more than 20 magnet academies offered at schools across Lafayette Parish.

Raising awareness to boost enrollment

While it extends to fifth grade, those numbers are low, but proponents want to change that by raising awareness of the program.

"Fourth and fifth grade are in survival mode," Zhou said. "We want more people involved and enrolled in the program."

Leonard and fellow parents have created the Mandarin Immersion Ambassadors of Acadiana (MIAA) group that works like a mix of a parent-teacher organization and a nonprofit.

It provides school support like a PTO while also works to grow the program's reach in the community. They are raising money to achieve official nonprofit status, said Leonard, who is vice president of the group.

Because of the low numbers, fourth- and fifth-grade students also take science and social studies in English. More of their day is in English compared to their younger peers.

"Lower grades have higher numbers. We hope to keep those numbers up," Herrmann said.

As students move past fifth grade, they can take an online Chinese course at David Thibodaux STEM Magnet Academy, but the goal has always been to grow the program to higher grade levels should enrollment and funding allow.

"Chinese immersion will grow as long as it's given a shot," LeBrun said.

'Immersion is not limited to knowing a language'

One way to get the word out is through events. Middlebrook Chinese immersion students participate at the annual Lunar New Year Festival and other events put on by the Lafayette Chinese American Association and Asian Chamber of Commerce of Acadiana.

Over the summer, the kids sang for some Chinese visitors to Lafayette General Medical Center, and MIAA was part of a community showing of "Kung Fu Panda" for Movies in the Parc downtown, Leonard said.

The Chinese American Association, which Zhou said includes more than 50 families, hosts events all year to provide opportunities for students, from visiting the Asian market to seeing a Chinese symphony or dance.

"They have to make the connection to culture and the language," Zhou said. "Immersion is not limited to knowing a language. You also appreciate culture."

Leonard's daughter Olivia was zoned for Middlebrook, and she didn't know about the program until they went to register her for kindergarten. She thought, "Why not?"

"Chinese is a very widely spoken language," Leonard said. "And they get exposure to a whole new culture."

Setting up students for future success

Leonard also expects being bilingual to be good for her daughter academically.

"Parents always want the best," she said. "If you set them up early, they will be successful."

That success could be financial, too. LeBrun and Leonard see future job opportunities for immersion students and an economic benefit to Acadiana.

"In this part of the world we have a lot of international businesses, especially French companies, and we also have law firms that want to deal with international issues," LeBrun said. "If we had local people here who were bilingual they could fill those jobs and create a more rich environment."

Zhou has seen it in her own children, who speak French, English and Chinese. She said they travel and work with companies that speak different languages.

"They are not afraid because they have a cultural understanding," Zhou said. "I hope now Chinese immersion students have that benefit in life. Learning a language is just a small part of it."

Xia said bilingual education gives students a global perspective.

"It is helpful to build up the concept of international thinking," Xia said. "They know how Chinese people think, act, behave, so they won't misunderstand one day when they have a Chinese coworker."
