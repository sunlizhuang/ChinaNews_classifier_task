UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Zhang Jun on Thursday reaffirmed China's commitment to upholding multilateralism as well as the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.

Speaking at a Security Council open debate on upholding the UN Charter, Zhang said that as a cornerstone of multilateralism, the charter establishes the basic norms governing international relations in the present day, develops generally recognized principles of international law, and charts the way forward for human society.

Unilateralism is dealing heavy blows to the international rule of law and the international order, while protectionism is plunging the world economy into a pit of uncertainties and acts of bullying is threatening global peace and stability, he said.

Against this backdrop, Zhang said "revisiting and reminding ourselves of the spirit of the charter is all the more relevant" as this year marks the 75th anniversary of the UN.

Zhang noted that China was the first country to sign the UN Charter. "It has consistently and scrupulously adhered to the purposes and principles of the charter and has unfailingly supported efforts to defend the authority and functions of the United Nations."

China's proposal of building a community of shared future for humankind is a continuation and sublimation of the purposes of the UN Charter, he said, affirming that China will honor its commitment, uphold the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes, and uphold sovereign equality, political independence and territorial integrity of all countries and non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, and the principle of no threat or use of force.

China will fulfill its responsibilities under the UN Charter, actively participate in UN peacekeeping operations, seriously fulfill its financial obligations to the UN, and support the organization's central role in international and multilateral affairs, he added.

China will actively implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and continue to promote high-quality development of the Belt and Road Initiative, so that the dividends of China's development can benefit all countries in the world, Zhang said.

Regarding the situation in the Middle East and the Gulf, Zhang emphasized that the "unilateral adventurist act" of the United States has led to a high degree of tensions in the region.

He said China supports the UN secretary-general's call for peace, adding that China has been actively engaged in diplomatic efforts and is committed to playing a responsible and constructive role in safeguarding international law, equity and justice, and regional peace and stability.

China calls on the relevant parties to exercise maximum restraint, do the utmost to return to dialogue and consultation without delay, jointly work for the de-escalation of tensions and uphold the Iran nuclear deal, he said.

Zhang warned that if the situation in the region spun out of control, it would not serve the interests of any party. "Restoring peace is of crucial importance to the entire world. The Security Council should uphold its responsibility vested by the UN Charter to maintain international peace and security."
