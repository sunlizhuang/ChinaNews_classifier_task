Herbert Kuehne, of Monroe Township is a self-described "Bach, Mozart and Beethoven person," but after attending a standing room only performance at the Monroe Township Library of traditional Chinese music he concluded, "I was quite pleasantly surprised. I definitely liked it!"

Kuehne was among those in attendance at a Chamber Concert of Traditional Chinese Music presented by the Princeton Symphony Orchestra in partnership with the Monroe Township Cultural Arts Commission. The three performing musicians were part of Music From China, a New York based chamber group playing traditional Chinese instruments, which was founded in 1984.

Kuehne added, "I was very impressed with the music, which I didn't know if I was going to like it or not because it's so different."

Susan Chang founded Music from China in 1984. She says the group also has a Chinese name, which translated means "long wind" and with good reason.

"The music is like a wind that blows from ancient times across the continent to the U.S. and everywhere," she said. "So there's a continuity from ancient times to the present."

She emphasized the strong connection between flow of the music and the flow of nature, calling to mind images of wind and water. The first song was titled "Melody of the Purple Bamboo."
