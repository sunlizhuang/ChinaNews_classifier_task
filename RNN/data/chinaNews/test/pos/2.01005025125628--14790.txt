The other day, after ninety minutes of solitary yoga on the floor of his home office, in Bel Air, Mark Sweet drove to Stage 20 on the Warner Bros. lot, in Burbank, to preside over the audience during a taping of the CBS sitcom “Mom.” Sweet, a sixty-eight-year-old magician and hypnotist who used to work as a professional Willy Wonka impersonator, wore a gray sweater, black jeans, and Gucci loafers. He carried a small black bag of magic tricks, as he does most Tuesdays and Fridays, when he keeps studio audiences “warm”—primed to laugh loudly at scripted jokes—between takes and reshoots.

Sweet took a seat in the empty house to watch the dress rehearsal of the week’s episode. “If you actually distill the comedy, it’s about the laughs,” he said. “I’m the front line of that.” Each week’s audience supplies the episode’s recorded laughter. Sweet, the liminal space between the audience and the show, supervises this precarious choreography. The taped laughs are doctored only to edit out the occasional strange shriek or squeal.

The twenty-two minutes that air on television are culled from many hours of stop-and-start taping in front of a group of restless human beings. Sweet is an emollient so crucial that he is known as the “king” of audience warmup. Garry Shandling used to arrange “The Larry Sanders Show” tapings around Sweet’s schedule.

“With the audience, it’s like bullfighting,” Sweet said. “Either they have you, or you have them.”

Outside, on the studio lot, a guy with a long gray ponytail and a red beret, who works for a company called Audiences Unlimited, wrangled a couple hundred unvetted audience members into a single-file line. They surrendered their cell phones, and, later, were handed slices of pizza in Styrofoam containers. When the company has trouble filling the seats, it pays organizations looking to fund-raise—senior centers, halfway houses, sororities, the Marines—to come pack the audience. Once inside, they become Sweet’s responsibility.

When the run-through was finished, Sweet walked onto the stage, through the set for the house where Anna Farris’s and Allison Janney’s characters live. Conferring with the first and second assistant directors, he reviewed a forty-five-second laugh from the previous week, provoked by a character throwing salt over her shoulder into a baby’s bassinet.

The audience traipsed in, and Sweet milled around, greeting people: “Are you folks ready to laugh? Are you ready to be part of television history?”

Desiré Gonzales, a writer who attends the tapings every week with her mother, sat in the back row. “We want to see the shows, but we also want to learn the business, get familiar with the four-camera setup,” Gonzalez said. “You’ll see the writers huddling around the director, looking to see what works, thinking about reactions and changes.”

With everyone seated, Sweet opened a bag of fun-sized chocolate bars, which he keeps on hand to throw into the audience as a reward for clapping. “It’s a three-ring circus,” he said. “There’s the performance down there on the stage, with the actors. Then, there’s my little lab going on up here, with the magic. And then all the dynamics going on in the audience.”

While the cast set up for the first scene, Sweet performed a magic trick with a twenty-dollar bill, then started a break-dancing competition between a schoolteacher from Ohio and a teen-ager visiting from China.

“You have to be attuned to everyone—it’s very precise, like a ballet,” he said. “The live audience sets up the timing and the tone. We find laughs that aren’t even in the script.”

Sweet was in the middle of pretending to cut off a woman’s finger when the A.D. alerted him that they were ready to roll. “Sweetheart, have a seat,” Sweet told the woman. “And remember: it’s about your energy, about your laugh. Keep the laughter very strong, folks.”

For the next two hours, the writers and the producers reworked the episode in front of the twitchy onlookers. Sweet kept them distracted.

“If you lose the audience, you’re screwed,” Sophia Lear, a producer who worked with Sweet on “Living Biblically,” another CBS comedy, said. “You never get them back. A bad warmup is a blunt instrument—blasting hip-hop music, screaming things into a mike. It’s hell.”

The taping dragged into its third hour. “I’m using the power of waking suggestion”—a hypnosis term—“to get the audience to understand that they’re part of television history,” Sweet said later. “My entire energy is devoted to getting each of them to realize: we’re the other characters in this play.” ♦
