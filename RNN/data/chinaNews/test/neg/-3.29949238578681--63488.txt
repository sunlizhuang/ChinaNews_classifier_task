(Bloomberg) -- China is spending at least $10 billion to control the coronavirus outbreak and reaching out for medical supplies as the first wave of international experts heads to the disease’s epicenter.

A cruise ship in Japan with 70 victims has the most infections outside China. Another exhibitor quits an industry event in Barcelona.

Scientists modeling the virus in Wuhan predict infections may peak this month. The illness has now killed more people than SARS.

WHO Team Heads to China (3:30 p.m. NY)

The World Health Organization’s assistant director-general, Bruce Aylward, will lead a team of medical experts heading to China as the nation fights the coronavirus outbreak.

Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a Sunday tweet called Aylward a “veteran of past public health emergencies.” An advance team left Geneva for China on Sunday, he said.

Aylward coordinated an interagency review that led to the first system-wide activation procedures for major infectious disease emergencies, according to the WHO’s website.

WHO also will hold a global forum Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva to accelerate research into the coronavirus outbreak in China, Ghebreyesus said in a separate tweet.

China’s ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai, endorsed WHO’s involvement earlier on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

“We are coordinating with the World Health Organization because a lot of things are done under the auspices of the World Health Organization,” he said. “All of us respect the WHO as the most professional intergovernmental body in the world.”

Amazon Quits Mobile Event (2:50 p.m. NY)

Amazon pulled out of the mobile phone industry’s MWC Barcelona trade show this month, citing concerns tied to the coronavirus, Spanish news agency EFE said, citing a company spokesman.

Nvidia and Ericsson are among exhibitors skipping the Feb. 24-27 event, the world’s biggest trade show for the mobile phone industry.

The organizer, GSM Association, said Sunday the event will be held, acknowledging “some large exhibitors” withdrew but that more than 2,800 plan to attend. Travelers from Hubei are barred and travelers to China must prove they left the country more than 14 days earlier.

MWC Barcelona will increase medical staff, step up cleaning and disinfection services and introduce a “microphone disinfecting and change protocol” for presentation speakers.

China Cites Medical Gear in Merkel Call (2:15 p.m. NY)

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told German Chancellor Angela Merkel he hopes other nations will back his country’s efforts to fight the coronavirus and help his government buy medical supplies from Germany, Xinhua reported, citing a Sunday call between the leaders.

Li said China’s actions exceed recommendations of the World Health Organization. “The Chinese government and people are confident and capable of winning the fight against the epidemic,” he said, the state-run news agency reported.

Merkel said that Germany is paying close attention and has taken a “prudent stance” in dealing with the epidemic, Xinhua said. Merkel said Germany has not imposed excessively restrictive measures.

China Rejects Virus Speculation (12:30 a.m. NY)

China’s ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai, dismissed suggestions the coronavirus originated from a military laboratory or was part of biological warfare research, and warned against such speculation.

”I think it’s true that a lot is still unknown and our scientists, Chinese scientists, American scientists, scientists of other countries, are doing their best to learn more about the virus,” Cui said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation” broadcast. “It’s very harmful, it’s very dangerous to stir up suspicion, rumors and spread them among the people. For one thing, this will create panic. Another thing, that it will fan up racial discrimination, xenophobia.”

Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, last month in a tweet said Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak, has China’s only laboratory that works with deadly pathogens including coronavirus.

Cui also said he expects medical experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be part of the global health team of the World Health Organization traveling to China this week.

“We welcome the American experts to participate in our efforts,” Cui said, dismissing suggestions the Beijing government was refusing U.S. offers of assistance.

U.S. Targets 3 Border Crossings (11:30 a.m. NY)

The U.S. added medical screening staff at three border crossings and some seaports in its fight to block the coronavirus, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said Sunday.

Checkpoints at San Ysidro, California; Buffalo, New York; and Blaine, Washington; account for the “highest amount” of traffic of Chinese nationals traveling to the U.S., he said.

“We are taking extra precautions for those ports of entry, as well as all ports of entry, to make sure medical care and screening is occurring,” Wolf said Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”

The U.S. also is checking cargo ships with crew from China to make sure none have the virus or show symptoms. If they do, “we are holding them out of the port,” he said.

For a week, the U.S. has diverted passengers who have visited China to one of 11 international airports, which Wolf said account for “the vast majority of traffic from China.”

Singaporean Cases (10 a.m. NY)

Singaporean health officials are trying to trace three new cases to see if they’re linked to previous infections or travel to mainland China. Of the 22 locally transmitted cases, investigations and contact tracing have found links between 15 of the cases with the three currently known clusters, health officials said Sunday in an emailed statement.

Four patients have recovered and been released from the hospital, the officials said.

Canadian Evacuation (10 a.m. NY)

Canada is sending a second chartered plane to China to bring its nationals out of Wuhan, the city locked down over the coronavirus outbreak, Canadian Press reported, citing Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne.

The plane will depart Monday and return Tuesday with the last group of Canadians seeking to be repatriated, Champagne said in Ethiopia Sunday.

Israeli Warnings (10 a.m. NY)

Israel’s Health Ministry widened its travel warning on Sunday to additional Asian destinations, including Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Macau, South Korea and Taiwan. It advised the public to consider whether travel to these places is “necessary.”

China Boosts Funding (7:30 a.m. NY)

China said it’s spent 31.55 billion yuan of the 71.85 billion yuan allocated to fight the outbreak, according to Xinhua, which cited Finance Minister Liu Kun. Liu said authorities will make moves to support bringing the epidemic under control, and urged local and regional officials to look out for small businesses that have been hurt.

China’s central bank will provide the first batch of special re-lending funds for combating the coronavirus on Monday, and will offer the facility weekly to banks later this month.

Singapore Revokes Work Permits (7:30 a.m. NY)

Singapore authorities revoked the work permits of four foreigners and immediately repatriated them after a breach of quarantine orders. Along with two permanent residents, they were caught at their places of employment during a leave-of-absence period that’s mandatory for those who had recently returned from China.

Six employers had their foreign hiring privileges suspended for two years for not ensuring their workers stay home, the manpower ministry said.

Spanish Links to French Ski Resort (6:30 a.m. NY)

A U.K. citizen tested positive on the Balearic island of Mallorca, according to Spanish health officials, who added that the infection appears to have occurred in a ski resort in France.

“The British patient had been exposed to another person with before arriving to Mallorca,” Fernando Simon, national director of the center for coordination of alerts and emergencies, said in a televised press conference.

The rest of the man’s family have tested negative for the virus, but will continue to be under observation, he said. It’s unlikely they will develop the virus although if they have been negative so far. The patient is the second case detected in Spain, and in both cases contagion occurred outside Spain.

On Saturday, French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said a group of Britons sharing a ski holiday in Les Contamines-Montjoie in the Alps were diagnosed with the virus. Four adults and a child have been confirmed as having the illness and 11 people have been hospitalized. The nine-year-old boy who was among the new cases had visited two local schools in the area.

Spain’s Simon didn’t identify the French resort where the Mallorca case may have occurred.

Fourth Case in Britain (6 a.m. NY)

In England, a further patient has tested positive for novel coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the U.K. to four, the Press Association reported, citing England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty. The new patient is known to have had contact with a previous case, and the virus was passed on in France.

Six More Cases on Japan Cruise Ship (5 p.m. HK)

Another six passengers on a cruise ship quarantined in Japan have been infected with the new coronavirus, according to a statement by the operator of the ship.

Princess Cruises confirmed the number following a test by the Asian nation’s health ministry, the statement said. That brings the total number of infections on the Diamond Princess cruise ship to 70, making it the biggest center of infections outside of China. The health ministry was not immediately available for comment.

Japan’s Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said Sunday the country will give priority on virus inspections to elderly people on the ship in Yokohama. There are about 600 people on the vessel who need medicine, he said.

World Dream Cruise in HK Given Clean Bill of Health (4:55 p.m. HK)

Hong Kong authorities say 3,600 passengers and crew quarantined on a World Dream cruise can now disembark the ship. Three Chinese passengers were confirmed with the virus when the cruise was in Vietnam just over two weeks ago and they have since been isolated in China.

The crew have tested negative for coronavirus, according to the Centre for Health Protection. The staff and passengers will leave in batches from 5:30 p.m., Hong Kong’s Cable TV reported.

Italy Maintains Ban on Flights to and from China (4:12 p.m. HK)

Italy will continue to ban flights to and from China, the first European Union country to have taken such a measure.

“Diplomatic relations are relevant and economic issues are fundamental, but the right to health is even more important,” Health Minister Roberto Speranza told newspaper Corriere della Sera. Italy has suspended from Feb. 2 to April 28 flights to and from China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

U.S. Embassy Suspends Visa Services (12:20 p.m. HK)

The U.S. will suspend regular visa services in mainland China as the coronavirus epidemic leaves it with “limited staffing.”

The U.S. embassy in Beijing and consulates in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenyang may not be able to run regular visa services but may make available some emergency appointments, according to a statement on its website Saturday.

China to Boost Medical Equipment Production (10:59 a.m. HK)

China said it will increase government procurement to boost output of medical equipment and drugs that are in acute shortage.

The nation is pushing producers of safety and health screening equipment, and makers of drugs and vaccines to run at full speed as soon as possible, the National Development and Reform Commission said Sunday. The government will help companies secure funding, licensing, facilities and raw materials if needed, and will buy any unsold products, it said.

Wuhan Outbreak Peak Calculated in Study (8 a.m. HK)

The coronavirus may have infected at least 1 in 20 people in Wuhan, the epicenter of the global outbreak, by the time it peaks in coming weeks, according to scientists modeling its spread.

Trends in reported cases in Wuhan -- a city of 11 million people in lockdown since Jan. 23 -- broadly support the mathematical modeling the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine is using to predict the epidemic’s transmission dynamics.

“Assuming current trends continue, we’re still projecting a mid-to-late-February peak” in Wuhan, said Adam Kucharski, an associate professor of infectious disease epidemiology, in a Sunday email.

Kucharski and his colleagues base their modeling on a range of assumptions about the virus, including an incubation of 5.2 days and a delay from onset of symptoms to confirmation of infection of 6.1 days.
