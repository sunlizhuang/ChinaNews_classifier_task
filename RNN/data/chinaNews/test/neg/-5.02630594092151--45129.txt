A 44-year-old Chinese man has passed away from the new coronavirus in the Philippines, the country’s health authorities reported on Sunday, becoming the first death from the disease outside of China and intensifying global fears about the spread of an epidemic that has claimed more than 360 lives. The man, who was from Wuhan, the epicentre of the novel coronavirus, died from “severe pneumonia.” Since emerging from the city in China’s central Hubei province, some 17,000 people have been infected with the virus, which can cause fever and breathing difficulties. China has locked down Wuhan, a city of 11 million, and several other cities, but millions of people had already begun travelling to celebrate the Lunar New Year before the restrictions were imposed.

The victim had arrived in the Southeast Asian nation on January 21 via Hong Kong with a 38-year-old woman who also tested positive for the virus and remains under observation. The couple had visited Cebu and Dumaguete before going to the capital, Manila, and Philippine epidemiologists are now tracking down passengers who were on the same flights to urge them to take precautions and further tests.

"This health event is fast-evolving and fluid. We are continuously recalibrating our plans and efforts as the situation develops," said Francisco Duque III, the health secretary, according to the Philippine Star. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, the World Health Organisation representative to the Philippines, tried to reassure the public. “We need to take into mind that this is not a locally acquired case,” he said. Shortly before announcing the death, the Philippines introduced a temporary entry ban on non-Filipino travellers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. A host of other nations are following suit with restrictions to stop the virus from spreading further. About 100 cases have been reported in at least 24 countries, including the UK. Indonesia said on Sunday it would temporarily stop flights to and from mainland China starting on Wednesday and bar visitors who have been in China for 14 days from entering or transiting. From Monday, New Zealand will deny entry to visitors departing from or transiting through China. Korea and Japan are barring noncitizens who have been recently in Hubei and Taiwan has extended a ban to Chinese nationals from Guangdong, a southern province that has also been hit hard by the virus. The US, Australia, Singapore and Israel have banned foreign nationals from visiting if they have been in China over the previous 14 days, and advised their own citizens not to travel there. The death toll in China soared to 304 on Sunday, with authorities reporting 45 new deaths from the previous day.

The rapid transmission of the virus, 2019nCoV, which has already surpassed the similar, although more deadly, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome which swept through Hong Kong and China in 2002-03, has prompted unprecedented curbs on the Chinese population. More than 50 million people in Hubei have been effectively sealed off. Some 500 miles away, Wenzhou, a city of nine million people in eastern Zhejiang province, has now also been virtually shut down, with only one resident per household allowed to go out every two days to buy necessities.

China reported on Sunday that it had completed a 1,000-bed makeshift hospital in Wuhan within just six days to help the city’s struggling medical facilities. The Huoshenshan – or Fire God Mountain - hospital will open on Monday and be staffed with 1,400 medical workers from China’s armed forces, many of whom have experience in treating SARS and Ebola. However, in Hong Kong, thousands of public hospital workers have decided to strike on Monday, demanding the government close the city’s borders with mainland China to shut out the virus.
