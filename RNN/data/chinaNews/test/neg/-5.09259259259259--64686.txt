Per a report by qz.com, the virus has been detected in 24 countries, most of them involving people who traveled to China.

There has been no confirmed case in Africa but concerns about the outbreak of the virus in the continent remain high.

In the wake of fears of a possible spread of the virus, Ethiopian Airlines cut down its February 2020 flights from Addis Ababa to Beijing, Chengdu, Guanzhou and Shangai by 33%.

The airline has also changed its aircraft that ply the same routes from Boeing 777 and A350 to Boeing 787-8 resulting in a 20%-45% change in capacity on the different flights.

The airline’s decision follows similar one by other African carriers such as Kenya Airways and Rwandair.

In other news, the coronavirus has, in recent times, caused havoc in a number of countries in the developed world, and the race for a cure appears to be all that everyone looks forward to.

As health officials brace themselves for the worst, Africa is yet to record a single case of infection. Information available shows that over 31,000 people have been infected since late December 2019.

Trips between Africa and China grow by the day, and per a report by Bloomberg.com, closer ties between them have increased the rate of exposure to the virus.

YEN.com.gh understands that about 20 African countries have already discussed the possibilities of an outbreak, taking into consideration the general state of medical facilities.
