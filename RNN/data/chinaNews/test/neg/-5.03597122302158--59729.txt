The reasons for many young people from South Africa to go teach in China differ from financial goals to travelling the world. But imagine working in a foreign country only to be met with an apocalyptic-like virus sweeping the country.

With the outbreak of the dreaded Coronavirus in Asia, the Paarl Post spoke to two Paarlites who are teachers in China.

Christine Coetzee (27), an ex-learner of La Rochelle High School in Paarl, has been teaching English in Chengdu, capital of south-western China’s Sichuan province, for the past few months.

She says ever since the outbreak of the Coronavirus this usually bustling city with a population of almost 15 million people has become all but a ghost town. Where streets are usually filled day and night with throngs of people, as well as restaurants, bars and club being crowded, a deadly silence has fallen upon the city as people have now placed themselves under house arrest.

“And if you do see people on the streets, they all have masks on for fear of the virus,” says Coetzee, who herself has been holed up in her flat for the past week.

“There is also a strict security presence. Whenever we leave our apartments and return, our temperatures are taken to see whether there is any change. Visitors are also not allowed into the flats, and when food deliveries are made, they may no longer be delivered inside, but we have to go and fetch them outside.”

Furthermore, Coetzee explains many of the Chinese actually believe the virus was caused by beer, and they have been pouring beer down drain pipes. And there are those who are dumping their pets on the street because they again heard that the virus spreads via animals.

“No-one seems to know what the next step is, and where we go from here, and the authorities are remaining pretty tight-lipped.”

In short, Coetzee is bored from being stuck indoors most of the time – very bored!

Another Paarlite who prefers to remain anonymous explained she was on holiday in India when news of the virus broke. The former Paarl Girls’ High School learner is a teacher in Shanghai, and returned to South Africa after the virus had hit China as all flights to China were cancelled.

“My two friends and I arrived at Shanghai airport to leave for India, and we saw the first reports on the news, but we didn’t think much of it,” she said. She then explained when they arrived at their hotel in New Delhi the Coronavirus was on every news channel.

“It was terrifying,” she admitted. After their holiday, which was over the Chinese new year, she was forced to return to South Africa for the time being.

The Chinese government is also requiring all citizens and expatriates to send daily updates to their employers, including a name, body temperature and current location.

Her flatmate, of Canadian-Cantonese decent, is trapped in their apartment under self-quarantine. “She said the streets are empty and it’s a very busy metropolitan city,” she said. “I must be back in Shanghai by 10 February and put myself under quarantine to start working again on the 17 February.”
