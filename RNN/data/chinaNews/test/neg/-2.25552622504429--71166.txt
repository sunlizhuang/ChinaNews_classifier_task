She recommends passengers undergo a quarantine again when they reach Canada, but a Montrealer on the ship says, "My head would explode!"

A McGill University expert on viruses is warning that the decision to quarantine passengers aboard the Diamond Princess — including a Montreal couple — has probably backfired, and is recommending that those Canadians returning home should likely be quarantined again.

To date, 218 people on the luxury liner have fallen ill from the coronavirus in less than two weeks, not counting a fire department officer who escorted an infected passenger off the ship. That firefighter tested positive for the virus Friday despite the fact that he was wearing a mask and googles.

Dr. Anne Gatignol, a microbiologist who has studied virus-cell interactions, had urged Quebec to require that Canadians returning from China self-quarantine for 14 days upon their return to the province. A week later, Quebec followed her advice.

This time, Gatignol is urging that 255 Canadians on the Diamond Princess do the same when they return to the country.

“From a virologist’s perspective, a cruise ship with a large number of persons on board is more an incubator for viruses rather than a good place for quarantine,” Gatignol said on Friday.

The ship is the second most contagious spot on the planet for coronavirus, after China, according to epidemiological data.

“It is likely that the number of infections will continue to rise, although I cannot exclude that it could decrease within the next days,” Gatignol said.

“We just don’t know. Several other viral infections on cruise ships have been reported in recent years. They were mainly norovirus infections giving gastroenteritis and they affected many people on each ship. Although the mode of transmission is different, I tend to believe that the number of infections will increase unless more and more people are disembarked, either on Japanese soil or repatriated.”

Stung by criticism that it has mishandled the quarantine, the Japanese government began on Friday to transfer passengers who tested positive who are 80 and older, as well as those in windowless cabins, to a medical facility ashore. It is also offering healthy passengers the option of finishing out their quarantine in housing units on land.

“It is probably very difficult for Japanese authorities to find a quarantine space on land for 3,500 passengers,” Gatignol explained.

“This is why each government who has citizens on board should take appropriate measures to bring their citizens back home to continue the quarantine in their respective countries. As the Trenton (Canadian Forces) base will soon be freed from the people repatriated from Wuhan, our government should take measures to bring back the Canadians from the Diamond Princess to the same place (or another one) using a similar protocol.”

Officials with Global Affairs Canada were not immediately available for comment.

Bryan Doyle and Lucie Mauro, the Montreal couple who have shared their experiences aboard the Diamond Princess with the Montreal Gazette, are upset with Canadian authorities for not responding to their questions about what’s to come for them. The Japanese government has set Feb. 19 as the end date for the quarantine.

“I wish the government of Canada would give us the info we really need and stop regurgitating the same useless crap,” Doyle said by email. “All they say is (they) will help in getting medication. That has been taken care of long ago. They also say they will help in contacting friends and family. I think 99.9999 per cent of Canadians figured out how to do that long ago as well.”

Doyle has a number of questions, including whether Ottawa foresees Canadian passengers being allowed to come home Feb. 19.

“What happens when we get back?” he asked. “Can we go home? I hope and pray that after 14 symptom-free days in quarantine, we will be free to go home. I do not want to be subjected to another quarantine in Canada. My head would explode!”

On Thursday, Doyle recalled, “cabin fever set in pretty bad … so we opted to go out on deck for one hour. It was nice to get out but depressing to come back in.”

Passengers and crew have used Twitter extensively to communicate with the outside world and show how they’re coping. On Friday, Valentine’s Day, the kitchen crew tweeted a video of them dancing to Justin Beiber’s hit tune Yummy.
