What is Coronavirus?

Coronaviruses are actually a family of viruses. Common types of these viruses mimic the common cold while also causing various respiratory issues. Other forms of coronavirus can be much more severe, and may even lead to death. Here are some of the possible symptoms:

Fever

Runny nose

Headache

Sore throat

Cough

Trouble breathing

In more extreme cases, leading to pneumonia or bronchitis

Interestingly, most people have been infected at least once in their lives, as reported by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The viruses cause illness in both people and animals, but typically only spread either from person-to-person or animal-to-animal – rarely would an animal coronavirus evolve or mutate to the extent of infecting people. But China may be experiencing one of those rare cases, as Chinese authorities report most patients in the Wuhan City outbreak have been linked to a large seafood and animal market.

Now, here is a rough timeline of everything that has happened concerning coronavirus. We’ll continue to report on new outbreaks or quarantines, while keeping this piece updates as well.

To Protect Yourself…

The World Health Organization (WHO) says it’s important to:

Cover your mouth and nose while sneezing, with a tissue or your elbow.

Put the tissue straight into a closed bin.

Wash your hands afterwards, and then frequently, with soap or sanitizer.

Keep your distance from people who are coughing and sneezing.

A Rough Timeline of Current Coronavirus News

On December 31st, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) is alerted by Chinese authorities that pneumonia-like sickness cases are circulating in the city of Wuhan – the largest city in Hubei, a province in Central China. People are quarantined and investigations ensue.

The CDC pinpoint a large seafood and animal market where the cases may have originated, leading the market to be closed on January 1st, 2020.

Comes January 9th, when the WHO reveals that the coronavirus currently circulating is not a known type, which is causing elevated concern. By this time, 59 people have been reportedly affected by the virus, with 7 of them being in serious condition.

The 1st person dies in China on January 11th, while the number of people sickened gets reduced overall.

On January 13th, the virus travels outside of China’s borders, hitting Thailand.

Two days later, on January 15th, China’s health commission says that the virus hasn’t definitively been transmitted from human-to-human, though it can’t be ruled out.

A case of the virus hits Japan on January 16th.

A second person dies in Wuhan on January 17th. The CDC announces tighter protocols for screening individuals at 3 airports: San Francisco, New York’s JFK, and Los Angeles.

By January 21st, 6 people have died and the sick-count rises to 200+ in China as it spreads throughout the country. By this time, it has made an appearance in China, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea.

Also by January 21st, the 1st case of coronavirus was discovered in the United States in the state of Washington. The man landed in the states from Wuhan on January 15th. Following the news, the Washington State Department of Health made a decision to monitor 43 people who had close contact with the man. This is in Snohomish County.

Around this time, it was reported that the Chinese government quarantined the city of Wuhan and voiced plans to shut down the airport and public transportation. Approximately 17 people have died and another 500+ sickened.

The virus is known as 2019-nCoV.

An Israeli biological warfare analyst sheds light on how coronavirus spreading globally may have originated in a laboratory in the city of Wuhan linked to China’s covert biological weapons program. The laboratory is headed to be soon be cleared to work with the world’s most dangerous pathogens.

Meanwhile, concerned citizens cite years-old news relating to the coronavirus, drawing possible connections to then-and-now.“Ralph Baric, an infectious-disease researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, published a study [in 2015] on his team’s efforts to engineer a virus with the surface protein of the SHC014 coronavirus, found in horseshoe bats in China, and the backbone of one that causes human-like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in mice. The hybrid virus could infect human airway cells and caused disease in mice, according to the team’s results, which were published in Nature Medicine.”Could there be a connection?

Citing how the Chinese government covered up information regarding the SARS outbreak from 2002-2004 (the government hid initial SARS cases for 4 months), Chinese citizens fear the government is currently hiding some information about the coronavirus. According to the New York Times, the first case of the virus was actually reported on December 8th – not December 31st. Wuhan officials “insisted that it was controlled and treatable.” China censors are said to be scrubbing the internet. What’s more, police said that 8 people who posted on social media about the virus were ‘spreading rumors.’ More on that in the link – you should check it out.
