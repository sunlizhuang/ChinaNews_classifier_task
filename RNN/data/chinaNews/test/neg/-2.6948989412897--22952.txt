"This is a single travel-associated case, not a local emergency," said Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady. "We obviously take emerging viruses seriously and there are still many unanswered questions."

The risk to the public is "low at this time both nationally and in Chicago," and there's no need for people to change their behavior, Arwady said.

She confirmed the patient is a woman in her 60s and said she is "clinically doing well and in stable condition. . . . She was not symptomatic when flying." Officials did not say in which hospital the woman is being treated.

The woman traveled to Wuhan in late December and returned on Jan. 13. She began to feel unwell, went to her doctor's office—"which is exactly what to do," said Arwady: "call ahead and seek medical care."

The woman remains hospitalized primarily for infection control, Arwady said, and will remain hospitalized until she is no longer symptomatic. Health care workers will be monitoring people the woman came into contact with, Arwady said.

The patient had not taken public transportation nor attended any big events, Arwady said, "so this is all very reassuring in terms of infection risk to the general public."

Andrew Velasquez, managing deputy commissioner at the Chicago Department of Aviation, said the agency has been monitoring the situation with the CDC and city Health Department while maintaining normal airport operations.

The CDC is currently monitoring 63 suspected cases across 22 states. Officials say they would immediately inform the public if another case is confirmed.

The first U.S. case was a man in his 30s who was traveling in Wuhan and arrived back in the U.S. on Jan. 15, Washington state health officials said on a call with the CDC on Jan. 21.

AIRLINES TAKE A HIT

United Airlines Holdings and American Airlines Group each slid more than 5 percent on concern the virus will limit demand for air travel and tourism. The news was having an impact on the broader markets, too.

NY INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE CASES

Three people in New York are being investigated for possible infection with coronavirus, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office. A fourth person has been investigated and tested negative.

The patients have been isolated while their cases examined, and samples are being tested by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cuomo’s office said.

New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport is one of several ports of entry where passengers from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak is centered, are being routed. Passengers arriving from there are being screened and checked for symptoms, though the virus can incubate for at least several days before signs arise.

S&P FALLS AFTER POSSIBLE THIRD U.S. CASE

U.S. lawmakers said health authorities are expected to confirm a third case of coronavirus in the U.S., following a closed-door briefing between lawmakers in Washington and federal health officials.

Sens. John Barrasso of Wyoming and Josh Hawley of Missouri said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told lawmakers about the new case at the briefing. The CDC earlier today announced a second case, in Illinois, and has said it expects more to emerge as it monitors more than 60 people.

The S&P fell to a low on the day after the lawmakers’ remarks following the briefing.

FRANCE CONFIRMS 2 CASES

French Health Minister Agnès Buzyn declared two confirmed cases of the coronavirus from China. They are the first reported cases in Europe.

The first case is in Bordeaux, and the other is in Paris. Buzyn said the first patient, a 48-year-old man, had returned on Jan. 22 from a trip to China that took him through Wuhan; she didn’t provide details on the Paris patient.

The patient in Bordeaux was treated for symptoms the next day and hospitalized. He has been placed in an isolated room so as to not have further contacts, Buzyn told reporters at a press briefing.

“We will do everything possible to keep this epidemic under control while knowing it’s possible, even probable, that there will be other cases, particularly in Europe,” she said.

CHICAGO OFFICIALS: 'NO IMMINENT RISK TO PUBLIC'

The Chicago Department of Public Health said in a statement today, "at this time, public health officials do not advise of any imminent health risk to the public."

The department asks health care providers to "immediately notify both infection control personnel at their health care facility and CDPH (call 3-1-1 for reporting)" if they have a patient under investigation for the coronavirus, and asks for "a detailed travel history for patients being evaluated with fever and acute respiratory illness."

The Health Department did not recommend any extra precautions for people to take, but said travelers should avoid non-essential trips to Wuhan, and anyone who has traveled there in the last two weeks days and who feels ill " with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing" should stay home unless seeking medical care, and call ahead to their healthcare provider if they believe they have the virus.



MORE U.S. CASES EXPECTED

U.S. federal and local health authorities are monitoring more than 60 people as they attempt to catch new cases of coronavirus in travelers from China, where the outbreak is centered. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed a second case in Illinois Friday.

“We are expecting more cases in the U.S. and we are likely going to see some cases among close contacts of travelers and human-to-human transmission,” said Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

The Illinois patient developed symptoms after returning from Wuhan, China. The woman, in her 60s, is in stable condition and has been isolated in a hospital to try and avoid infecting more people, said Jennifer Layden, chief medical officer and state epidemiologist for the Illinois Department of Public Health. She didn’t have close contact with people outside her home after her return, and authorities haven’t seen symptoms in others associated with her.

The virus has an incubation period of about two weeks before infected people start to show symptoms, which resemble a cold or flu, the CDC said. U.S. authorities have screened more than 2,000 travelers from China on 200 flights without identifying any new patients.

The CDC said it’s working to get tests for the virus out to states so they can more quickly identify cases. Currently, samples have to be sent to the CDC for analysis.

“This situation is rapidly evolving. Information is coming in hour by hour, day by day,” Messonnier said.
