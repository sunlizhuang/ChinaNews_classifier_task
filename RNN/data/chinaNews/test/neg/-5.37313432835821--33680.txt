Calling The Sun's report "completely groundless", a spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in London said on Monday that "China has provided necessary assistance and facilitation to countries who wish to bring back their citizens from Wuhan in accordance with internationally accepted practice and epidemic prevention rules."

On January 27, 2020, The Sun reported that the UK planned to send a rescue plane to bring back hundreds of British citizens who are trapped in Wuhan, but "a Foreign Office source revealed" that Chinese "officials have told all countries its lockdown will not be lifted for repatriation flights."

The spokesperson said that China has provided necessary assistance and facilitation to countries who wish to bring back their citizens from Wuhan in accordance with internationally accepted practice and epidemic prevention rules. The British Embassy in China has clarified that "the news is completely inaccurate. FCO in London is contacting the journalist to correct their understanding of this case. We can assure you that these inaccurate messages have not come from our government."

The spokesperson emphasized that since the outbreak of the disease in Wuhan and other places, the Chinese government has demonstrated a strong sense of responsibility for the people in China and around the world. Firm measures have been taken to combat the virus and prevent its spreading.

"People throughout China are mobilized to fight the disease shoulder to shoulder, with the confidence, resolve and capability to beat the virus. Here in Britain, people from all walks of life have also come forward to offer their help, which is touching and encouraging,"said the spokesperson.

The spokesperson accused The Sun of fabricating stories and creating chaos. "The relevant report of The Sun does nothing but disrupt the disease prevention and control efforts at a critical moment when people throughout China are joining hands to bring the virus under control. This is immoral, irresponsible and unacceptable. The Sun should right the wrong and clarify immediately."
