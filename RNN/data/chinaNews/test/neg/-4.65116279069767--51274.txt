Abu Dhabi: The UAE General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) ordered the suspension of all flights to and from China, except the capital Beijing, from February 5 in order to contain the coronavirus disease.

The GCAA told airlines to inform passengers coming from Beijing about new procedures whereby they have to undergo 6-8 hours of comprehensive medical screening before boarding to ensure the safety of passengers.

All incoming and outgoing flights to Wuhan - the city at the centre of the crisis - have been cancelled since January 23, 2020.

Earlier on Monday, Emirates airline reduced its capacity on China routes due to low demand amid growing concern about the disease.

Last week, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways' connecting flight which allowed passengers to travel from Beijing, China, to Nagoya, Japan, were temporarily suspended between February 3 and 29, due to low demand, according to Khaleej Times.

Dozens of regional and foreign airlines have cancelled flights to China while the governments around the world have banned people coming from China.
