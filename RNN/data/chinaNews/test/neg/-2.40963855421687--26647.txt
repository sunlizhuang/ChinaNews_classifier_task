JOHOR BARU: A family of three from China was stopped by police before boarding a flight at the Senai International Airport, after the parents defied an order for their two-year-old daughter to be quarantined due to a high viral fever suspected to be caused by the novel coronavirus.

The father, mother and their two-year-old daughter from Guangzhou had gone to the Sultanah Aminah Hospital (HSA) casualty unit on Friday night.

The girl was referred there by a private hospital after initial checks showed that she had a viral feversuspected to be caused by the coronavirus.

At HSA, it is learnt that the parents were told that the girl would have to be admitted to Permai Hospital to be quarantined.

The parents reportedly refused to accept the advice and argued with the medical team before leaving HSA.

Hospital sources said the father refused to allow his daughter to be warded at Permai Hospital as the family had a flight to catch the next day to return to China.

HSA medical staff were said to have advised the parents that their child’s well-being was more important and that they should not board the flight as her fever was high.

The father was believed to have told the doctor to just provide cough and fever medication.

The doctor realised later that the parents had left the hospital with their daughter without permission.

The doctor then lodged a report at the Johor Baru Central station.

Johor police chief Comm Datuk Mohd Kamarudin Md Din confirmed the report and said the authorities then began a search for the family.

“We were able to locate them at the Senai International Airport at about 9.20pm on Saturday.

“The child has been sent to a hospital to be quarantined and for further examination and treatment, ” he added.

Johor Health Department director Dr Aman Rabu said the department was investigating the case and would send a report to the Health Ministry.
