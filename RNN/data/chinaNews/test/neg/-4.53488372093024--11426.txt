China is doing everything within its power to completely eradicate Xinjiang's Uyghurs, the country's prosecuted Muslim minority group, and won't even let them rest in peace anymore.

An AFP investigation - in collaboration with satellite imagery analysts Earthrise Alliance - recently revealed that at least 45 cemeteries had been completely destroyed in China's northwest region of Xinjiang. The investigation shed light on the continuous operations carried out to unearth and flatten burial grounds since 2014, with tombs smashed and human bones left discarded.

Gut-wrenching before-and-after photos show the complete demolition of hundreds of graveyards, many of them turned into parking areas and playgrounds.

In response to CNN's request for comments after discovering 60 other cemeteries that were wrecked, the Chinese government did not deny Islamic cemetery destruction.

"Governments...in Xinjiang fully respect and guarantee the freedom of all ethnic groups... to choose cemeteries, and funeral and burial methods," a spokesperson with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN.

In public documents, official reasons for the destruction include wanting to build "civilized cemeteries to promote progress." According to Rian Thom, an Uyghur historian at the University of Nottingham, "It's a great act of desecration and a kind of open insult Uyghur culture."

Uyghurs, victims of the biggest human rights crisis today, believe the destruction is only part of the government's master plan to entirely wipe them off the face of the country.
