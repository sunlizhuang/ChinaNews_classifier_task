White, a former Defence Department deputy secretary and later professor of strategic studies at the Australian National University, is an authority on the matter. For years he was in charge of the Defence Department’s co-ordination with Australia’s highly secretive high-tech intelligence agencies like the Defence Signals Directorate and the Five Eyes intelligence swapping agreement between the US, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

“The fact that a strategic ally is not now controlling the commanding heights of key telecommunications technology is terrifically challenging [for Five Eyes members like Australia],” he says.

America has dominated the field for most of the 73 years that the Five Eyes agreement has been in operation. Historically, this US dominance “has been very important to those countries”, White says.

He is “not at all surprised” by the US-led ban on Huawei. The obvious reason is the fact that the US was the dominant global player in making and developing high-tech defence and intelligence communications equipment. Now this is no longer the case, White is “not at all surprised that the idea was to simply try and knock them out of our systems. It’s an understandable thing to want to do,” he says.

But it is also naïve. White is perplexed by “the fact that this view was so easily allowed to prevail [when the Malcolm Turnbull-led Coalition Government made the decision to ban Huawei in 2018]. “It is naïve to assume that by knocking out Huawei we’ve closed one door, but the idea that it makes our communications safe from cyber-espionage” – from China or any other state – “is absurd.

“Whatever happens, we’ve got a major problem for protecting our communications from Chinese interception. What about the future 6G, 7G and 8G?” Moreover, “the competing systems to the Huawei systems are not American. They’re Finnish and Swedish.” Neither country is a member of Five Eyes, which is a sort of Anglosphere intelligence swapping enclave.

Historically, Sweden has been a neutral state, even maintaining its neutrality throughout World War II. Finland’s position is even more compromised – at least from a pro-American, defence-intelligence-cum-communications perspective. For many centuries a part of Russia, Finland at first sided with Hitler’s Germany in World War II, as the conflict came soon after a brief war with the Soviet Union in which highly mobile Finnish soldiers initially inflicted heavy casualties on Red Army troops in disputed territory close to Leningrad (now St Petersburg).

After Germany suffered a series of heavy defeats at the hands of the Red Army, Finland switched sides. Following Germany’s formal surrender, it remained a nominally independent state but its foreign policy was subject to a Soviet veto throughout the Cold War. This veto power proved to be a long-term strategic fait accompli, leading to the term “Finlandisation”. This refers to the effective corralling of one country’s foreign relations by another.

As Vladimir Putin’s Russia displays aggressive irredentist behaviour – triggering a border war with neighbouring Ukraine, seizing the Crimean peninsula and sabre-rattling against the Baltic states near Finland such as Estonia, which were formerly part of the Soviet Union – Finland’s impressive high-tech communications equipment would be regarded as problematic, to say the least, by Five Eyes members, particularly the US.

The China 5G ban issue is also re-emerging at a time of rising tensions within the Five Eyes alliance. A diplomatic row between Australia and Britain became publicly rancorous after a planned trip to Britain by the Australian Parliament’s intelligence and security committee was cancelled. This came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his cabinet decided to re-affirm a heavily telegraphed move to allow Huawei to provide equipment and technical expertise for some parts of Britain’s emerging 5G network.

A more specific cause of the cancellation was reports that the UK High Commissioner to Australia, Vicki Treadell, had sent a letter to members of the Australian parliamentary committee complaining about the leaking of highly sensitive material about the UK’s pending Huawei decision.

In particular, Treadell’s letter referred to press reports that Australian Labor MP Anthony Byrne, who is the deputy chair of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, criticised the British Huawei decision during a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.

Until the matter blew up, Coalition and Labor members of the committee were scheduled to travel to Britain next month and hold meetings with their counterparts in the British House of Commons.

These meetings were planned under the general umbrella of the Five Eyes agreement. However, the visit was cancelled and there are reports that members of the Australian committee are planning a trip to the US to hold meetings with members of the US Congress, intelligence officials and Washington-based Australian intelligence operatives.

This latest flare-up reflects the tensions within the Five Eyes alliance over Britain's green light for Huawei in defiance of American advice to follow the US and Australia in banning the Chinese high-tech titan. Australia first banned Huawei from supplying equipment to the NBN in 2012 under Labor prime minister Julia Gillard, and in 2018 the Turnbull government banned the company from taking part in the 5G rollout on security advice.

Meanwhile, Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and the daughter of the company's founder, is being held in Canada where she is fighting extradition to the US. She is wanted on charges of fraud and sanctions violations.

More recently, a conservative British politician has echoed US and Australian warnings about any Huawei involvement in 5G rollouts. The chairman of the British Parliament’s foreign affairs committee, Tom Tugendhat, is reported to have warned of security problems with Huawei. Following Britain's withdrawal from the European Union on January 31, he said the British government should not "take back control from Brussels only to hand it over to Beijing".

The Australian row with Britain serves as a reminder that, as Hugh White puts it, “there’s a lot of history behind it and that gives it a bit of weight". The 1947 Five Eyes agreement is an offshoot of the close intelligence swapping arrangements the US and Britain developed during the dark days of World War II. These have been the subject of countless books and films, from James Bond to John le Carré.

Soon after the Allied victory, the US and Britain cemented these arrangements in a formal agreement. A bilateral arrangement born during a global conflict and glued together by not just common interests but a deep cultural bond of a common language and consanguinity was extended to include Canada, Australia and New Zealand. However, the new three were effectively members of a Five Eyes B-team.

White says Five Eyes remains “fundamental to Australia and other partners’ capacity to collect signals intelligence”. It is, he says, “the critical form of intelligence. America provides 90 per cent of the effort” and junior partners like Australia are “enormous beneficiaries. It is very important.

“Signals intelligence is nice to have. However, people tend to overstate the significance of the Five Eyes in some of the things that have been said. Signals intelligence can be extremely valuable in making decisions, and particularly valuable in a conflict. The longer the time frame, however, the less significant it will be in forming those decisions."

As an example, White says, signals intelligence would be crucial in informing another power about, say, the current positioning of major Chinese naval vessels in the South China Sea. However, it will only play a peripheral role in determining the size and nature of the Chinese navy in 20 years’ time.

At this point, White turns philosophical. “Getting along with a China that is dominant in some area of technology is just part of the world. Banning Huawei from involvement in the 5G implies that we can get back to ‘normal’. But we’re now in a [different] situation and we just have to deal with that. If they want to read our laundry list they can.

“But it’s always possible to protect your communications if you work hard at it. We just have to work really hard to protect the things that we need to protect. But don’t pretend the old days are back and we [the US-led alliance] are on top.”
