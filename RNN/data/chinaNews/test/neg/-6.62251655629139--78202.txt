China's President Xi Jinping is feeling "desperate" about his country's reaction to his response to the deadly coronavirus sickening tens of thousands of people in his country, particularly over what he did for more than a month while the disease was growing, Far East expert Gordon Chang said Wednesday.

"Obviously, what he did for more than a month in December and three-quarters of January was to suppress information, and then all of a sudden he decides oh, we have to impose the draconian measures," Chang told Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo.

He added that the Chinese people are "livid" but aren't talking about Xi's policies. Instead, they are talking about a change in government following the death of the Chinese doctor who first sounded the alarm about the virus.

State media in China reported on Jan. 7 that Xi presided over a meeting during which he talked about coronavirus, but it wasn't being reported at the time.

"People are saying in China, of course, that Xi Jinping completely allowed the virus to spread when he knew what was going on," said Chang.

He noted that "every option is on the table" concerning Xi's future, even though he has declared himself as president of China for life.

"His policies are responsible for the spread of the coronavirus," said Chang. "On the other hand, he's been imposing draconian and totalitarian controls and those will survive even after the epidemic passes."

Chang also said Wednesday he was surprised after a U.S. federal court dismissed a lawsuit over a rule against Huawei products being used in federal agencies.

"I thought Huawei might win the suit, but nonetheless, this shows Huawei is going to get no break in this country," said Chang. "Huawei is lying to people."
