International committee to consider asking nations not to develop autonomous killing machines





LAST UPDATED AT 11:24 ON Thu 14 Nov 2013

WHEN Hollywood invented the Terminator - a killer robot played by Arnold Schwarzenegger - it was pure science fiction. But now, France is calling for an international ban on developing exactly that: fully-autonomous killing machines.

On Friday, nations will vote on whether to consider imposing a ban, at the annual Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) in Geneva, says Sky News. How real is the prospect of a self-guiding robot attacking human targets with lethal force?

Who is developing autonomous military robots?

The US, UK, Israel and South Korea are all already flying armed drones with some degree of autonomy. On the ground, the US is developing battlefield robots including the remarkable Big Dog - though there is no indication they would ever be weaponised.

According to the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots: "Several nations with high-tech militaries, including China, Israel, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, are moving toward systems that would give greater combat autonomy to machines."

Who is campaigning against them?

A group of 44 NGOs including Human Rights Watch has banded together under the banner of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots to lobby governments to impose a ban on developing such weapons. Now France, in its role as chair of the CCW, will ask nations to consider a ban.

What exactly do the French want to ban?

Sky reports that France is calling for a ban on the development of "any fully autonomous weapon that could select and fire on targets without human intervention". While an Arnie-shaped murderous robot is a real future possibility, opponents of the systems are more immediately concerned by the drones already hovering overhead - it would be a small step to allow them to select and attack their own targets.
