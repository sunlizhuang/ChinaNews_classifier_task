Incheon International Airport has set aside three arrival gates for all passengers who fly from China, as part of government-led efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus.







The segregated gates are A and F of Terminal 1 and A of Terminal 2.







Dozens of health officials with state-of-the-art equipment are checking the body temperatures and other health conditions of all arrivals from China before they reach immigration checkpoint. All passengers from Wuhan, the ground zero of China's epidemic, are denied entry starting today in accordance with the government countermeasure announced on Sunday.







All arrivals from China have to give their phone numbers in Korea so authorities can make immediate contact in an emergency. The arrivals must also give their addresses in Korea and any details of visits to Wuhan. Travelers who fail to meet the requirements are denied entry.







The gates opened at midnight of Tuesday and the first users were from Korean Air KE854, which arrived from Beijing at 12.40 a.m.
