JASON OM: In the coronavirus epicentre of Wuhan, only the brave venture outdoors. This drone shows how the deadly disease outbreak has shut down a city of 11 million people. - 7.30, ABC, 5 February, 2020

Hello I’m Paul Barry, welcome to Media Watch

And as the coronavirus continues to spread — with the latest tally at 906 dead and more than 40000 infected — it’s no surprise that fear and fake news has also been spreading on social media.

Like this popular conspiracy theory:

Is it just me, or does that look more like they are preparing mass graves in advance? - @prmullen69, Twitter, 25 January, 2020

That, we need hardly tell you, was not true. And nor was this:

- fortune cookies - Mi Goreng noodles - wagyu beef … may contain traces off the corona’s virus ... - Hahn Le, Facebook, 28 January, 2020

Nor were stories that 2.8 million were already infected or that:

People are literally "Dropping-Dead." - Hal Turner Radio Show, 23 January, 2020

To be fair, most of Australia’s news media has done an excellent job debunking such myths and reporting the facts:

SANDRA SULLY: Now firstly, you should not be avoiding Chinatown or any other area with a high Chinese population. You cannot get coronavirus from imported food. It can only live briefly on surfaces. Garlic and sesame oil will not stop you from contracting it. The virus has not mutated into a more lethal strain. - Ten News First, Channel Ten, 6 February, 2020

But some fake news has managed to make its way into the mainstream:

KATE CREEDON: Chinese blogger Wang Mengyun has apologised for eating a bat in a video which has sickened millions of viewers. She tucked into the bat at a Wuhan restaurant in the city where the coronavirus first took hold. - 9NewsWatch, Facebook, 30 January, 2020

That 9NewsWatch Facebook video was viewed more than 2 million times. And is on track to be its most popular ever.

Naturally, the Daily Mail also wanted to cash in on the clicks, and it too linked the Chinese blogger to the outbreak, posting the video of Wang and another bat soup eater, prompting a flood of racist comments like this:

And now they are eating bats that are giving them a disease. GOOD! Sick of their shit. - Adam Russell, Daily Mail Australia Facebook comments, 24 January, 2020

Definitely Karma for killing all the animals they do in such a horrific way.. - Wendy Walker, Daily Mail Australia Facebook comments, 24 January, 2020

But the video of Wang was not actually filmed in Wuhan or even in China. It was shot three years ago in Palau in the Pacific, where bat soup is a delicacy.

And while coronavirus may indeed come from bats, swine flu comes from pigs and bird flu comes from chickens. And it’s not just Chinese who eat them.

Meanwhile, Seven News was showing footage of people apparently falling down dead, ripped off from the internet.

So was that real? Unlikely.

The World Health Organisation says coronavirus is an illness with flu-like symptoms such as “fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties” and sudden collapses would be atypical.

The Daily Mail has also offered us this exclusive:

How Chinese students are avoiding the coronavirus travel ban and sneaking into Australia by LYING on their departure cards - and bragging about it once they clear customs - Daily Mail, 4 February, 2020

And on social media, the Mail was taking that further and claiming the lies could kill:

So careless. They are putting thousands of Australians in danger of contracting the deadly virus! - Daily Mail Australia, Facebook, 4 February, 2020

Angry emoji indeed.

But on a closer read the story relied on a series of text messages from one student, who claimed he’d changed his immigration form to say he’d arrived from Hong Kong, which is not subject to the government’s travel ban.

Students cheating the ban? Thousands at risk? A classic beat-up.

And the lying theme was also picked up by The Daily Telegraph:

Parents masking travel at schools … some families are allegedly dodging the suggested fortnight of quarantine by lying about their travel … - The Daily Telegraph, 30 January, 2020

The source for that story was one mother from North Ryde, who said some parents were claiming they’ve been to Bali when they’d actually been to China.

And some Tele readers reckoned they knew who the culprits were:

... parents who have visited China in the last 4 weeks might not want to tell others this and may use the excuse, "me no understand English" when asked. - The Daily Telegraph, 30 January, 2020

That sort of scaremongering and finger pointing was being fanned by News Corp’s Sydney and Melbourne tabloids, with the Herald Sun calling it “Chinese Virus Pandamonium” and the Telegraph running this message on its front page:

BACK TO SCHOOL PLEA China kids stay home - The Daily Telegraph, 29 January, 2020

For which editor Ben English issued a half-hearted apology:

“Our headline was in no way intended to single out Chinese people,” ... “If people have taken offence at the headline then I would like to apologise to them.” - The Guardian, 31 January, 2020

Meanwhile, Sky News host Gary Hardgrave had his own crazy theory about the global health emergency:

GARY HARDGRAVE: ... this thing has been cooked up, it's pretty evident, cooked up by some mad scientists in China, I don't care what anyone says. - Hardgrave, Sky News, 7 February, 2020

Over in London, meanwhile, The Sun was offering a helpful, simple cure:

Shoppers amazed that Dettol kills deadly coronavirus — as it’s listed on bottles - The Sun, 31 January, 2020

And their source for that? One Facebook post from a shopper in Britain.

But within 24 hours, The Sun had cancelled its scoop with a follow-up warning:

Dettol warns there is NO evidence its spray can kill deadly coronavirus from Wuhan ... - The Sun, 1 February, 2020

Despite that setback, The Sun was at it again a few days later, peddling the claim that a glass of hot toddy — yes, that’s whiskey mixed with honey — will beat the deadly flu, all because a 25-year-old British teacher in Wuhan had got better after having the drink.

Not quite 100 per cent proof.

So, given that social media is the main breeding ground for this sort of misinformation and fake news, what are the social media giants doing to fight it? Well, their fact-checkers are certainly working overtime.

Facebook has promised to limit the spread of information flagged as false and is warning people against trying to share the content.

Twitter is threatening to remove people who spread false information from its platform and is topping its search page with an invitation to know the facts.

And Google now has this SOS alert at the top of coronavirus searches along with the latest news from the WHO.

So, are these efforts working? Not entirely.

Queensland MP George Christensen told his Facebook followers last week of one patient who’d presented to a local hospital simply because they’d eaten Chinese food.

Seems the fear is still out there, and ready to be fanned.
