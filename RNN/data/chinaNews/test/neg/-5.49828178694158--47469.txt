The government in an emergency meeting Sunday decided to ban all visitors who have been to Wuhan and surrounding Hubei Province in China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, in the last two weeks. The ban becomes effective on Tuesday and was announced 13 days after the first case of coronavirus was reported here on Jan. 20 and three days after the World Health Organization announced a global emergency. Some 62 countries have now banned or restricted visitors from Hubei and other parts of China.

Hubei has already gone into lockdown, but more than 300 cases of coronavirus infection have been reported in six other Chinese provinces, sparking demands here to ban all visitors from China. The Korean Society of Infectious Diseases, Korean Society for Healthcare-associated Infection Control and Prevention and Korean Society for Antimicrobial Therapy said in a joint statement, "Forty percent of infections have been reported in parts of China outside Hubei Province, so limiting only people from Hubei is not enough." Health and Welfare Minister Park Neung-hoo at a press conference on Sunday afternoon said, "We will consider halting the issuance of short-term, tourist visas" for Chinese visitors. The government raised its travel advisory on China from a recommendation to refrain from visiting to evacuation. All tourism to China will be prohibited.

The government also declared a temporary halt of visa-free travel to Jeju Island for Chinese tourists. A Chinese tourist who visited Jeju Island recently has tested positive for coronavirus after returning to China. The government said it will impose 14 days' self-quarantine on all workers at nursery schools and post-natal care centers who visited China.
