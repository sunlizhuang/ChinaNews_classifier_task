Information about the coronavirus is likely to be in high demand as it was confirmed today that British citizens flown from Wuhan would be placed in quarantine in Wirral.

An evacuation flight to bring British nationals back to the UK from the city at the epicentre of the outbreak in China will leave on Thursday night, the Foreign Secretary has said.

Around 100 British nationals evacuated from the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak will be held in quarantine on Merseyside.

The flight, set to leave Wuhan city tonight, is expected to arrive at RAF airbase Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire, on Friday morning.

They will then be transported to a former student accommodation block on the grounds of Arrowe Park hospital.

So what exactly is the coronavirus and how worried should we be in the UK?

What is the coronavirus?

Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause disease in animals. In Wuhan, China, a new strain of the virus made the jump from animals to humans.

This new virus, known as Novel coronavirus (2019-nCov), is thought to be more dangerous than other forms of the coronavirus.

Currently, 15-20% of all cases of the virus have been classed as "severe" and the current death rate from the virus stands at two percent.

Generally the coronavirus causes more severe symptoms in people with weakened immune systems, older people and those with long-term conditions like diabetes, cancer and chronic lung disease.

How many people have been infected?

Cornonavirus is known to have killed 170 people in China and infected more than 7,000.

So far it has spread to 16 other countries, including the United States.

There is no cure for the coronavirus, much in the same way that there is no cure for the common cold.

Over the past week, the number of confirmed infections has tripled and cases have been diagnosed across the whole of China and in neighbouring countries.

The actual number of people to have contracted the virus may actually be far higher as those with mild symptoms may not have been detected.

Experts at Imperial College London have suggested that there may be as many as 100,000 cases of the virus, with a margin of anywhere between 30,00 and 200,000 cases.

Are there any cases of coronavirus in the UK?

According the government website, as of 30 January, 161 tests have been carried out in the UK on people suspected of having the coronavirus.

Of those tested, all 161 have been confirmed as negative and we are yet to have a confirmed case of the virus here in the UK.

There are currently no confirmed cases in the UK or among UK citizens abroad and the government describes the risk to the public as "low".

The government says it is monitoring the current situation closely and is working with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the international community.

The Department of Health and Social Care has been publishing regularly updated data online every day at 2pm on the number of people tested for the virus.

Between 10 and 24 January, 1,466 passengers and 95 staff arrived in the UK on direct flights from Wuhan.

Of those people, 162 have already left the UK and 760 are outside the disease's incubation period.

Public Health England are working to contact the remaining passengers.

The government's response to the outbreak is guided by the advice of the Chief Medical Officer.

According to the government website, if and when the first case of the virus in the UK is confirmed, it will be announced as soon as possible by the Chief Medical Officer.

What are symptoms?

Typical symptoms of the coronavirus include fever and cough that can progress to severe pneumonia causing shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.

According to the government's advice the virus causes more severe symptoms in people with weakened immune systems , older people, and those with long-term conditions like diabetes, cancer and chronic lung disease.

In the confirmed cases of the virus, symptoms reported included fever, coughing, shortness of breath, muscle ache, confusion, headache and a sore throat.

Of the patients initially treated in China, a detailed analysis revealed that all 99 of the first patients had developed pneumonia - where there lungs became inflamed and the sacs where oxygen moves from the air to the blood were filling with water.
