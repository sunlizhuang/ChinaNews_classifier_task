While that eases concerns for some people at ASU, Chinese teachers in Gilbert say they're still keeping tabs on what's happening back home. Thankfully, their family and friends in China are OK so far. One teacher at Coronado Elementary School said she even canceled her trip back to China this summer because of the coronavirus.

"I have my daughter who is just two years old. I’m afraid. I feel like to be a mom I don’t want to put her in that situation just in case," said the teacher, who didn't want to be identified.

"We had this before when I was in college," said Zhao. "There was a SARS breakout. That time I was really panicking, like fully, really panicking because it’s never happened before, but this time it just reminds me what happened back years ago."

Zhao said this time she's concerned, but not so panicked. She stays in touch with her parents and in-laws back in China.

"People are going kind of crazy because they cannot go to work," said Zhao. "They cannot go anywhere."

Zhao said her husband was planning to fly to China next month, but his airline canceled the trip.

"With his visa, he can only go back before June," said Zhao. "If he can’t, he won’t be able to go back to China for a while."
