The UK Foreign Office has issued urgent new advice amid the coronavirus outbreak, warning people not to travel to China.

The Foreign Office has warned against "all but essential travel" to the country and Britons staying in the affected Chinese province of Hubei could be flown home as early as Thursday.

It comes after there were fears the virus could have hit the UK as a man returning from Wuhan in China was isolated.

Drew Bennett, 39, told BirminghamLive that two ambulances turned up at his home in the city carrying medics in full-body suits.

The sight was captured on video by a local resident who watched the scene unfold from a nearby flat.

The Department of Health said there had been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK although a number of people have been tested.

The clip shows a man wearing a face mask entering a waiting ambulance while two other medics stand nearby alongside the hazmat-suited worker.

Drew remains in isolation while awaiting urgent blood test results. He said he had returned from Wuhan on December 31 and believing himself to have a serious case of the flu, took himself to bed.

His symptoms subsided and he visited the doctor on January 27 for an unrelated matter. His GP asked if he had visited China and he was told to return home when he said he had.

An ambulance was sent to his address and Drew was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital where he was put in isolation.

He said: "Once I got back I was really ill with, what I thought, was a bad case of the flu. At that stage coronavirus hadn't really been mentioned so I thought nothing of it. However, when I went to the GP on Monday and he asked as a precaution if I had been to China, he seemed really concerned.

"I was sent home and before I knew it, ambulances and people in Hazmat suits had turned up.

"I'm now in isolation and just waiting to get my blood test results.

"I don't feel particularly unwell now, but I've not been 100 per cent since returning from Wuhan.

"Since I got over the worst symptoms I've been back to work, shopping, just normal life.

"It's a really worrying time and not a nice experience."

The Foreign Office has yet to confirm details, but a teacher in Wuhan city told the Press Association that UK citizens were being given details of forthcoming flights.

Those stuck in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas have been urged to contact the British consulate before 11am on Wednesday if they wish to leave the country.

The British embassy in Beijing has said transport to get UK citizens out of China "may happen quickly and with short notice".

The Foreign Office has updated its travel advice to urge UK citizens to avoid travelling to China.

The advice said: "The Chinese government continue to impose further restrictions on movement within China in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

"It may become harder over the coming weeks for those who wish to leave China to do so.

"If you feel that you may want to leave China soon, you should consider making plans to do so before any further restrictions may be imposed."

China has imposed travel restrictions between its major cities and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism has suspended all tour group companies' activities to prevent further virus spread.

More than 100 people have now died in China due to the illness, with confirmed infections surging to more than 4,500.
