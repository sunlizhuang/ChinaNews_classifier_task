Jurors will return Monday to deliberate in the case of Tavist Chester, accused of murdering a man outside a Canton bar.

CANTON Jurors will return Monday to deliberate in the trial of a 25-year-old man accused of murdering another man outside the R Bar & Grill.

During spirited closing arguments Friday afternoon, attorneys said the case came down to the question of self-defense.

Tavist Chester is accused of fatally shooting 22-year-old Nigel G. Jackson.

Attorney Laura Mills said Chester fired gunshots because another man had pointed a gun at him.

"It’s an absolute justifiable act and right we have in this country," Mills said, adding self-defense applied to all charges her client faced, including aggravated murder, murder and and three counts of felonious assault.

Gunfire outside the bar followed problems inside, including when Chester was sucker punched, according to testimony. A fight ensued and the defendant was pulled outside the bar.

Chester testified Thursday that he had yelled for his cousins to leave the bar.

He said he grabbed a .40-caliber pistol he had hidden outside the bar and fired the gun because a man named Antonio Wallace, who had been in the bar that night, was pointing a firearm in his direction.

Chester told jurors he had feared for his safety because of past incidents involving Wallace and based on information provided by police.

Jackson was struck by three bullets outside the R Bar from a .40-caliber gun, including one to the chest, according to testimony.

Stark County Assistant Prosecutor Fred Scott said self-defense law wasn’t applicable because Chester didn’t withdraw from the situation and hadn’t faced imminent danger.

"He came back and he waited," Scott said. "That’s not self-defense, that’s murder."

Mills also told jurors the prosecution’s case had grown weaker over the course of the trial.

"It has crumbled," she said. "It has changed course, it has not stayed consistent."

The defense questioned video evidence, the number of witnesses who were questioned and other aspects of the case.

Police found shells casings of three difference calibers at the scene.

Scott, however, said the entire video footage taken at the bar shows jurors what happened.

And he said ballistics evidence supports the prosecution’s case.

"I ask you to focus on ... who reacted to what and what they reacted to," the assistant prosecutor said.

Scott said nobody fired shots at the defendant.

Chester "took shots with the purpose to kill," he said.
