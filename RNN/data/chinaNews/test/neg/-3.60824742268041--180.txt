Coimbatore: Passengers flying into the city from abroad will now be screened for coronavirus. According to sources, the move comes three days after two Asian countries - Japan and Thailand – reporting first cases of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).Health department officials have reactivated the fever screening set up in the city airport to screen the passengers with symptoms of cold and cough. According to an official, those who have visited China 14 days prior to developing the symptoms or worked in any hospital that treats patients with 2019-nCoV, they would be asked to get tested for the virus.There is also a move to compulsorily quarantine the passengers who have visited Wuhan district in China for 14 days, even if they do not display flu-like symptoms. Dr Ramesh, deputy director of health, Coimbatore, said, “We have asked a doctor and a nursing staff to be in the airport during the arrival times of the three international flights. The flight from Singapore lands in the city at 10pm, while the flights from Colombo and Sharjah arrive at 2.30pm and 3.30am, respectively.”While the screening started on Saturday, he said they hadn’t received any passenger, who had visited Wuhan district, or with flu-like symptoms.On December 31, 2019, the China country office of World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown case that were detected in Wuhan city. Chinese authorities then found novel coronavirus, a zoonotic virus, to be the cause. Like H1N1 virus, it causes flu-like symptoms of cold, cough and fever, sometimes followed by pneumonia, acute respiratory illness, breathlessness and kidney failure, leading to death.The WHO subsequently put other countries on alert and published an interim guidance on how to prepare for the virus, how to monitor sick people, test samples, control infection and treat patients. Three days ago, Japan and Thailand had confirmed first cases of the virus outside China and Wuhan.A couple of weeks ago, directors of public health in the country were notified about the coronavirus and issued guidelines on how to monitor and control the infection. After the two Asian countries detected their first cases of 2019-nCoV, authorities seem to have swung into action.
