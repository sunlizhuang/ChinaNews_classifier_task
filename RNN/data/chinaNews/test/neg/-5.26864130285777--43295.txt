Qantas suspends flights to China

From February 9, Qantas will suspend its two direct flights from mainland China to reflect the international travel bans imposed in wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

This come after entry restrictions were imposed by countries like Singapore and the United States, which will impact the crews who work across the Qantas International network.

“These entry restrictions pose significant logistical challenges for rostering crew to operate mainland China services, leading to the need to temporarily suspend these flights,” a Qantas press release says.

Qantas also said flights to Hong Kong, which is exempt from the travel ban, will run as per usual.

It will suspend its Sydney-Beijing and Sydney-Shanghai services from February 9 until March 29.

The Beijing service was already due to end, due to commercial reasons, on February 23.

When deciding on a date to suspend Qantas services to China, the airline said the volume of passengers flying both to and from China, and Australians wanting to return home from China was taken into consideration.

The province remains under virtual quarantine, with roads sealed off and public transport shut down, but small numbers of travellers continue to breach the lockdown.

The World Health Organisation declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday.

Cities across China have continued to implement special measures aimed at curbing the spread of the pathogen. Tianjin, a city in northern China with around 15 million people, said all schools and businesses would be suspended until further notice.

Amid fears that the virus could spread further overseas, the United States announced measures to restrict entry to foreign nationals who have recently been in China. All three major US airlines announced the cancellation of flights to mainland China on Friday.
