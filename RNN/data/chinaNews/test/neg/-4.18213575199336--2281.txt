The Chinese Paddlefish has been declared extinct by fisheries experts in China. Native to the Yangtze river, they were known to be one of the largest freshwater fish species which survived for millions of years.

The species could reach up to 23-feet in length and weigh up to 450 kilograms. Their distinctive features were their silver-coloured body and a protruding snout. According to experts, they were last spotted in 2003.

A recent basin-wide mission failed to find any proof of their existence, leading to scientists believing the fish disappeared between 2005 and 2010.

The species, also known as Chinese swordfish, lived since the Jurassic period, according to scientists. They had widespread numbers between 34 million and 74 million years ago and was one of the most common species in the Yangtze until the late 1970s.

But since the 1970s, their population started decreasing due to overfishing and habitat destruction.

China listed the fish as a 'nationally protected animal' in the 1980s. But in 2009, it was listed as 'critically endangered' following a survey by scientists.

Their population took a major hit after the Gezhouba Dam was built in the Yangtze river in 1981 that split the Chinese paddlefish population in two. The dam also prevented fish trapped below from swimming upstream to areas where they could give birth.

Unfortunately, there were no successful cases of breeding of Chinese paddlefish in captivity in the following cases.

"There have been no successful cases of breeding the Chinese paddlefish in captivity. Hence, when it died out in the wild, the species has become completely extinct," a maritime scholar at Yangtze River Fisheries Research Institute told CCTV.
