Ditch Chinese firm if you want a trade deal, US warns – The Times

Washington green-lights ‘priority’ trade talks – Daily Express

“Donald Trump will make one final bid to persuade Boris Johnson to ban Huawei from Britain’s 5G network this weekend when he sends one of his most senior ministers to London. With a decision on Huawei expected early next week, Steven Mnuchin, the US Treasury Secretary, will lay out President Trump’s concerns in a meeting with his counterpart Sajid Javid. It comes after senior civil servants recommended that the Chinese telecoms giant be allowed to bid for “non-core” elements of the mobile phone network. President Trump is concerned that Huawei equipment could be used for espionage, as the Chinese government can require private companies to spy on its behalf.” – Daily Telegraph

…as Prime Minister ‘weighs up Russian visit’

“Boris Johnson is weighing up whether to attend Vladimir Putin’s second world war commemoration parade in Moscow this May in a diplomatic test of his new government’s attitude towards Russia. During the event, which was first staged by Joseph Stalin, Russian soldiers will march through Red Square accompanied by tanks and missile launchers to mark the 75th anniversary of the conflict’s end. Mr Johnson is considering the Russian president’s invitation to attend the parade, according to four people with knowledge of the talks. The deliberations inside Downing Street are part of a wider discussion over how to handle relations with Moscow, which were tarnished by Russia’s attempted assassination in 2018 of former double agent Sergei Skripal with a nerve agent in Salisbury.” – FT

Dutch premier puts odds of a deal at ’50:50′ – The Sun

“Chancellor Sajid Javid on Thursday softened his tone on the landscape for corporate Britain after Brexit, telling business leaders in Davos that he would not seek to move UK regulations away from those in the EU “for the sake of divergence”. Mr Javid said the government would only change the rules under which UK companies operate if it “was in the interests of British business”, adding ministers would “weigh up the pros and cons” and consult with affected industries. The conciliatory message from Mr Javid came after he used a Financial Times interview last week to issue a stern warning to business leaders to end their push for Britain to stay in lock step with Brussels’ rules after Brexit.” – FT

Ministers 2) Patel maintains tough stance on new immigration controls

“Social care workers and other low-skilled migrants in key sectors will not be exempt from tough post-Brexit immigration rules even if there are shortages, Priti Patel reportedly told Cabinet. The Home Secretary apparently set out on Tuesday that there will be no so-called ‘carve outs’ under Boris Johnson’s Australian-style points-based immigration system as the government tries to simplify British border control. Migrants who want to work in occupations in which the UK has a shortage could be awarded more points under the new regime to boost their chances of being allowed in. But with no ‘carve outs’ there would effectively be no guarantees that such workers would be able to come and work in the UK in a development likely to spark business concern.” – Daily Mail

Death toll leaps to 25 – Daily Mail

“More than a dozen people in Britain have been tested for a deadly virus sweeping out of China, with the NHS under orders to question everyone with flu-like symptoms in an attempt to stop its spread. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has warned it is likely that cases of coronavirus will be seen in Britain as part of a “rapidly developing” global outbreak in which more than 20 million people have been quarantined. In China there have already been more than 630 confirmed cases and 18 deaths linked to the new virus, which is thought to have originated in snakes. There have been reports of cases in Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the US.” – The Times

Ministers 4) Skidmore criticises universities over lack of black academics

“Universities have been criticised after the number of black academics in leadership positions fell to zero in official figures. The most recent numbers, covering 2018 to 2019, published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) reveal that the number of black academics in leadership positions officially stands at zero. The year before, 2017 to 2018, the agency’s data recorded five black academics in the most senior roles. Due to the way the statistics are rounded, there could still be up to two in 2018/19, but the official count stands at zero. Universities Minister Chris Skidmore said: ‘It is unacceptable that the number of black academic staff in senior positions has fallen, as this does not represent our British society.’” – Daily Mail

Downing Street ‘won’t meddle’ in BBC leadership change

Corporation must face a full investigation into its flagrant abuse of public money – The Sun

“No 10 has insisted that it will not seek to interfere in the BBC’s choice for director general, after an anonymous Downing Street source threatened that if a leftwinger were selected then a government-appointed board chairman would fire them next year. Boris Johnson’s official spokesman said the choice of a director general was a “matter for the BBC”, after Tony Hall unexpectedly announced on Monday that he would step down this summer. But two briefings from Downing Street sources were given to the Daily Mail and ITV suggesting the government would look very unfavourably on the corporation choosing James Purnell, the former Labour cabinet minister and current director of radio at the BBC.” – The Guardian

Iain Martin: Johnson would to well to wean himself off his tendency towards gimmicks

“Under Johnson, power is centralised to an unusual extent in the prime minister’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, who wants to redesign the machinery of the entire British state. I have seen this reign of terror routine several times before and I know how the movie ends. In a democracy with a free press it never works… The Downing Street operation also seems addicted to gimmicks. It was briefed recently that the House of Lords is to be moved to York. Senior figures in the Conservative Party, former leaders among them, are angry. Again, there will come a time when the polls are poor and those grandees are needed to go out and bat for Boris. Alienating them is counterproductive.” – The Times

Labour 1) Nandy and Long-Bailey clash over plan to replace MPs

“John Bercow could be investigated over past allegations of bullying after the House of Lords agreed to change its rules amid new complaints against the former Speaker. The Lords conduct committee met on Wednesday to discuss closing a “loophole” in its code of conduct to allow inquiries into allegations against former MPs who become peers, the Telegraph can reveal. The meeting took place on the day new revelations emerged about a complaint against the former Speaker. Lord Lisvane, who served as chief clerk of the House of Commons, has passed a dossier of allegations to the parliamentary commissioner for standards, the MPs’ watchdog. It is understood to detail incidents in which Mr Bercow was alleged to have bullied and humiliated staff.” – Daily Telegraph

“Lisa Nandy lashed out at Labour leadership rival Rebecca Long-Bailey last night after the Corbynista candidate backed plans for a purge of moderate party MPs. Wigan MP Ms Nandy said the beleaguered party should be focusing on getting rid of Tory MPs rather than their own following Jeremy Corbyn’s humiliating defeat to Boris Johnson in December’s election. Ms Long-Bailey this week declared war on moderate Labour MPs as she said she wanted to introduce open selections for election candidates in a move which would make it easier for hard left activists to oust incumbents. Centrist voices in the party fear this is an extension of previous efforts by Momentum – run by Ms Long-Bailey’s campaign chief Jon Lansman – and other hard Left groups to oust opponents.” – Daily Mail

Labour 2) Khan under pressure to abandon fare freeze

Ministers ‘underestimated risks to taxpayers’ cash’ on HS2 – The Sun

Sturgeon’s civil servants press ahead with referendum preparations

“The mayor of London is facing increasing pressure to abandon his freeze of most public transport fares in the UK capital in the run-up to the mayoral election in May because of a squeeze on the city’s finances. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor since 2016 and favourite to win re-election, has maintained his policy of freezing most fares on the Tube and buses since 2016, at an estimated total income shortfall of £640m. But Transport for London, the government agency responsible for most of the capital’s public transport, is deep in the red — in part because of delays and cost overruns at Crossrail, the new flagship infrastructure project. TfL’s most recent figures show it had a net deficit of £422m in 2018-19 and is heading for a net deficit of £307m for 2019-20.” – FT

“Nicola Sturgeon has ordered her civil servants to continue compiling “White Paper Two” on Scottish independence despite Boris Johnson refusing her request for another referendum. The Telegraph can disclose that Scottish Government officials have started preparing an updated prospectus for a separate Scotland, to dovetail with the referendum the First Minister wants to stage later this year. Some civil servants have nicknamed the project “White Paper Two”, referring to the 650-page White Paper on independence unveiled by Alex Salmond and Ms Sturgeon before the 2014 referendum. Sources close to the First Minister said the new blueprint would have a different “shape” and format from the first document, titled Scotland’s Future, which cost taxpayers £1.3 million to produce and distribute.” – Daily Telegraph
