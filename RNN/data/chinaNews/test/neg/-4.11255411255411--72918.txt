GREEN BAY, WI (WTAQ) - The recent outbreak of coronavirus has caused panic for some, while others don't seem too worried about their chances of catching the illness. But scammers are following the headlines and feeding off the fear of the uninformed.

"We saw the same thing happening with other viruses like the Ebola virus and the SARS virus," says Susan Bach of the Better Business Bureau.

There are tons of people online offering information about the coronavirus outbreak - or proposing unique preventative measures to avoid the virus. But more often than not, those people aren't exactly experts on the matter.

"They're trying to take advantage of the questions people might have or the fears about getting this - and they're really using that to their advantage," Bach says, "Be very careful about links, social media posts, emails claiming they have information about the coronavirus."

With well over 90% of coronavirus cases quarantined on mainland China, 15 cases across the US, and just one confirmed case in Wisconsin - there really isn't much for most residents to worry about.

Some scammers may try to entice consumers with false fundraisers or charities to help those in need. Those pushing for support of people who they claim have been diagnosed - are likely not being honest.

"Be very suspicious of somebody using the mystery of this coronavirus to raise money for somebody," Bach says.

The same concept goes for those claiming they have a vaccine - or are funding ways to prevent the virus. For most individuals, staying away from anyone who has been to China recently should do the trick. But for those who are still concerned - ask yourself if the sources behind the vaccine are legitimate.

"If there had really been a medical breakthrough, would you really be hearing about it this way? Through social media or someone pitching something in an email?" Bach says, "Ignore those online offers for vaccines because they're totally bogus."

Scientists are working on a vaccine for coronavirus, but are reportedly unlikely to find the preventative medicine until the end of 2020 at the earliest.

If you feel sick, or believe you may have symptoms representing the coronavirus, it's recommended to see a doctor immediately. If you're in Northeast Wisconsin and haven't had any contact with someone who was recently in China, you likely have influenza - as the symptoms of both illnesses are relatively similar.
