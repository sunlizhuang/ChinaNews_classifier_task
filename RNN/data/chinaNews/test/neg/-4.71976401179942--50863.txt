He was experiencing a headache, flu and cough when he reached Pakistan.

A Pakistani student at China university has been quarantined since his return on Saturday as he showed suspected symptoms of novel coronavirus.

Shahzaib Rahujo studies petroleum at a Chinese university around 1,000km away from Wuhan where the deadly coronavirus originated.

Rahujo reached his village, Nangerji, late on Saturday night and was shifted to isolation ward on Monday after he fell ill. "He was experiencing a headache, flu and cough when he reached Qatar. He took some medicine to relieve the symptoms and was able to reach the village safely," Rahujo's elder brother, Irshad Ali, told The Express Tribune.

Ali added that his brother cleared medical screening at Jinnah International Airport in Karachi but once he reached his village, he started experiencing fever, flu, cough and fatigue.

Kept in isolation, Rahujo is facing neglect at Civil Hospital in Khairpur where he is admitted, as medics there are not ready to perform tests on him. Ali posted a video online showing how his brother Rahujo is being neglected in spite of his ill health and nose bleeding.

"We were on our way to Karachi when they told us to come back to the civil hospital. There, they put him in a dengue ward. But there is no doctor and we are not being treated properly," Ali said.

Rahujo or his family members were not given face masks at the hospital in spite of him returning from coronavirus-hit China.

Saeed Sangri, a social activist from Rahujo's village in Nangerji, said, "There is panic in the village. It is a remote area and the villagers do not even know much about the precautionary measures for coronavirus."

Meanwhile, Sindh Health Minister, Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, who directed district and provincial health officials to place the student in quarantine said, "There is no symptom of the virus."
