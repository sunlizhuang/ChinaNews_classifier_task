Health officials in New York have four people under investigation for novel coronavirus that are in isolation as their cases are being tested at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

So far, one of the cases has been proven negative and three are still pending, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The ages, locations and other details about the people weren't immediately available Friday.

"We are undertaking a wide-reaching and rigorous effort with all stakeholders, including health care providers, airports and federal health officials, to put in place the appropriate precautions to keep New Yorkers safe," Cuomo said in a statement.

News of the cases under investigation in New York come as the coronavirus death toll in China rose and infections spread around the world, including two confirmed cases in the U.S.

The second U.S. case was confirmed Friday morning involving a 60-year-old Chicago woman who recently returned to Illinois from Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in China. The other case involved a man in his 30s in Washington who also returned to the U.S. from Wuhan.

In China, at least 26 people have died, hundreds have been sickened and tens of millions are under lockdown as the virus sweeps across the country.

In the U.S., airports in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Atlanta and San Francisco have stepped up health checks for passengers arriving from China.

Local health officials in New York and New Jersey have been alerting medical providers about the situation and coordinating efforts with state and federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“While the risk to residents is low, our training prepares us to handle emerging disease outbreaks like this, Dr. Sherlita Amler, Westchester County health commissioner, said in a statement Thursday.

“Anyone who has symptoms and recently traveled to Wuhan or has had contact with someone from Wuhan should first call their health care provider and await further instructions to avoid exposing other."

On Friday, a New Jersey hospital reported a patient evaluated for possible infection with the coronavirus does not have the disease. The announcement came after state health officials on Wednesday distributed guidance to health professionals about the criteria to use in evaluating patients.

Because many respiratory viruses are circulating during this season, it is difficult to immediately identify patients with this virus, known as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV.”

The disease originated in a fish and animal market in Wuhan, and was believed to have been transmitted from animals to humans. The extent of human-to-human transmission is still unknown.

"Person-to-person transmission is still being evaluated but appears to be occurring within case households and in the health care setting," the New Jersey Health Department said.

How many confirmed coronavirus cases are there?

China's National Health Commission said the number of cases has risen to 830 as of Friday.

A 36-year-old man in Hubei died Thursday after a sudden cardiac arrest. The man was admitted to a hospital last month with a fever and is now the youngest known fatality from the virus. Most deaths have been older patients.

While most cases have centered in China, an increasing number of cases have been confirmed in other places, including South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.

What is coronavirus? What are the symptoms?

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to pneumonia.

Common signs of infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.

In more severe cases, infection can cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death.

How to protect yourself from coronavirus?

Health officials said the virus, which probably spreads through tiny droplets when a person coughs or sneezes, is low-risk.

Officials urged people to take the usual cold and flu season precaution: frequent hand washing, covering your mouth when coughing or sneezing and staying home when you don't feel well.

"These illnesses can pop up anywhere," said Trish Perl, chief of infectious diseases at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. "This is a dynamic situation that can dramatically change from day to day."

What is being done to prevent coronavirus from spreading

Authorities in Wuhan said Friday they were constructing a a 1,000-bed hospital like one built in Beijing during a SARS outbreak, a similar respiratory virus.

The 2003 outbreak left about 800 people dead after spreading from China to more than a dozen countries. The coronavirus hospital is planned for a 270,000-square-foot lot and will be completed early February.

The World Health Organization on Thursday declined to categorize the outbreak as a global health emergency, saying there is no evidence of human-to-human infection outside China.

Other scares have popped up around the U.S., too. A student from Tennessee Tech University was being tested for possible infection after he presented very mild symptoms possibly related to the virus, the university and state health officials said Thursday.

A Texas A&M University student was also being tested and is isolated at home, local health officials said. The man, who recently traveled from Wuhan, is improving, said Dr. Eric Wilke of the Brazos County Health Authority.

The State Department issued a warning Thursday not to travel to Hubei province amid the outbreak and said all non-emergency U.S. personnel and their family members were to leave the province.

"We don't want the American public to be worried about this because their risk is low," says Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

"On the other hand, we are taking this very seriously and are dealing very closely with Chinese authorities."

Westchester County health officials created a website to provide information about the outbreak, directing the public to visit health.westchestergov.com/2019-novel-coronavirus.
