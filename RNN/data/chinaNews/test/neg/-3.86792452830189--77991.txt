A patient suspected to have contracted the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has been isolated after a visit to a Somerset hospital, according to reports.

A person from Somerset arrived at Yeovil Hospital on Tuesday (February 18) at around 5pm and was immediately taken to a secure pod on site, a medical professional has said.

The source said the patient, who has cold-like symptoms, has been ordered to self-isolate after evaluation at the self-contained "coronavirus pod" near the accident and emergency ward on Higher Kingston in Yeovil.

A spokesman for NHS England has said the pod has been set up to "avoid causing unnecessary pressure in A&E".

Nine patients have currently tested positive for COVID-19 in the UK, and 5,216 people have been tested.

Both Yeovil Hospital and NHS England have declined to comment on this specific case.

"I was there as they brought them in"

The source, who is a local medical professional and wishes to remain anonymous, said the patient was suspected to have the virus and was being handled by medical staff with "full protection masks".

They explained: "I was there as they brought them in; they take them to a special pod outside the hospital.

"It’s a small mobile classroom type building opposite the entrance to the old car park.

"Every hospital has a reserved spot right next to A&E.

"The idea is that patients are taken to the pod if we are suspicious and they are assessed by doctors in full gear.

"If they think that there is a strong possibility of the coronavirus, like if they’ve been to China recently, then they will be sent to a special ward somewhere."

The source added: "I think this patient had been close to a relative who had been to China."

The patient was sent home by staff to self-isolate after being evaluated at the coronavirus pod, the source said.

Patients are safe to be discharged from isolation once they have had two negative respiratory tests for the coronavirus, twenty-four hours apart – this means they are no longer infectious and pose no risk to the public.

An NHS England spokesman said: "Following national guidance all hospitals are putting in place NHS 111 pods at their emergency departments, so that anyone attending hospital with symptoms of the virus can be kept isolated from other patients and avoid causing unnecessary pressure in A&E."

The NHS spokesman added: “Over the coming weeks many more of us may need to self-isolate at home for a period to reduce this virus's spread.

"Everyone can continue to play their part by taking simple steps such as washing hands to prevent the spread of infection and calling NHS 111 first before going to the doctors or A&E if they have any concerns about or show symptoms of coronavirus.”

This news comes after parts of Frome Medical Practice were cordoned off today (February 19) in another suspected case of the coronavirus.

"Drastic action" needed to contain virus, says expert

A local disease control expert has said the "drastic action" being taken with anybody suspected of having the virus in the UK is needed to contain the outbreak.

Bath councillor and University of Exeter lecturer Dr Bharat Pankhania, who worked extensively on the recent Ebola and SARS outbreaks, said: "While we are in the containment phase of the virus, we really have to take this drastic action.

"During self-isolation, the patient will need to stay indoors and not have any contact with anyone else - food will be delivered to their doorstep.

"This is like a game of chess - we have to hold the virus back for as long as possible - because if we don't, the cost of dealing with a large number of infected people would be much higher than the cost of taking drastic action quickly."

Advice to travellers from China The official NHS England advice is as follows: Travellers from Wuhan and Hubei Province If you have travelled from Wuhan or Hubei Province to the UK in the last 14 days you should immediately: · stay indoors and avoid contact with other people as you would with the flu · call NHS 111 to inform them of your recent travel to the area Please follow this advice even if you do not have symptoms of the virus. Travellers from other parts of China and other specified areas This advice applies to travellers who have returned to the UK from the following areas: · China · Thailand · Japan · Republic of Korea · Hong Kong · Taiwan · Singapore · Malaysia · Macau If you have returned to the UK from any of these areas in the last 14 days and develop symptoms of cough or fever or shortness of breath, you should immediately: · stay indoors and avoid contact with other people as you would with the flu · call NHS 111 to inform them of your recent travel to the country

Dr Pankhania added that the UK must now be on high alert.

He said: "While the circulation of a new virus started in China, we were watching the scene develop, but now we must really raise our watchfulness.

"However, in this country we have good healthcare, and healthy people. This is not China.

"We must exercise watchfulness, exercise good hygiene, and always remember to wash your hands regularly."
