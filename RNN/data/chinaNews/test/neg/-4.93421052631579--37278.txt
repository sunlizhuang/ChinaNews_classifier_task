Singapore Airlines Pilots and Cabin Crews Are Not Allowed to Flight to Beijing

News24xx.com - Singapore Airlines (SIA) will temporarily delay pilots and cabin crew on flights to Beijing and Shanghai, a move that requires them to return to Singapore as soon as possible instead of staying in two Chinese cities.

The new move, which is scheduled to start at 7.30am on Thursday (January 30), comes amid growing concern about the spread of the Wuhan virus.

SIA operates 21 flights every week to Beijing and 28 per week to Shanghai this month.

Flights will also continue to operate according to the schedule published by SIA.
