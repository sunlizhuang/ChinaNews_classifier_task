A Bangladeshi man who returned from China was admitted to Kurmitola General Hospital in the capital on Thursday.

The man was taken to the hospital in a government ambulance after the thermal scanner detects high temperature in the passenger’s body at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport (HSIA).

Confirming the matter to Jago News, Professor Doctor Abul Kalam Azad, Director General of Health Directorate, said the necessary tests will be done keeping the man at an isolation ward of the hospital.

Doctor Shahriar Sazzad, Health Officer of HSIA’s Health Centre, said we have sent a China returned Bangladeshi man to Kurmitola Hospital after some primary symptoms of coronavirus were found in his body.

However, the death toll in China from a deadly new coronavirus rose to 170, state media said on Thursday, with the worst-hit province of Hubei reporting 37 fatalities.

Some 7,711 people in China are now confirmed to have the infection, with 1,032 new cases in Hubei.
