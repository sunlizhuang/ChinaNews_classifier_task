The coronavirus, which has been named COVID-2019, has killed 1,380 people and sickened more than 64,000 people in China so far. The epidemic, which surfaced in a Chinese seafood and poultry market in December last year, has spread to 24 countries, forcing the World Health Organization to declare the situation a global health emergency.

The death toll due to Novel coronavirus so far is eight times the number sickened by SARS, which resulted in around 800 deaths 17 years ago. Scientists have not yet determined exactly how Covid-2019 first infected people. However, according to the evidence, it originated in bats, which infected other animals and then spread among people at a market in the southeastern city of Wuhan.

With more than 60 million people under lockdown in more than a dozen Chinese cities, the new outbreak is prompting calls to permanently ban the sale of wildlife, which many say is being fueled by a limited group of wealthy people who consider the animals' delicacies. ``There's a vast number of viruses in the animal world that have not spread to humans, and have the potential to do so,'' Robert Webster, an expert on influenza viruses at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, was quoted as saying by AP.
