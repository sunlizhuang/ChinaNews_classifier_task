Taiwan: Mask-wearing patients fainting in the street. Hundreds of fearful citizens lining cheek by jowl, at risk of infecting each other, in narrow hospital corridors as they wait to be treated by doctors in forbidding white hazmat suits. A fraught medic screaming in anguish.

Terrifying video clips on social media, reportedly posted by shocked citizens in Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus that has swept China and infected at least 18 people in seven foreign countries, did not paint a picture of a government in control. In one clip, posted by Badiucao, a Chinese-Australian cartoonist, but which could not be independently verified and was reportedly deleted from the Weibo social media site, the sick were seen sitting next to three bodies covered in white sheets. Other footage showed makeshift tents in hospital car parks.

After weeks of apparent delays in tackling the virus that first sprang from a Wuhan seafood market, the Chinese authorities locked down the city of 11 million citizens and put travel curbs on 13 other urban centres in Hubei province, corralling more than 40 million people.

It raised questions about why such extreme measures were necessary given that official figures of infections remained in the hundreds, and highlighted concerns about human rights and civil liberties. With government censors still scrubbing the internet, it left citizens afraid and in the dark.
