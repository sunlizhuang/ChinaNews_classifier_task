An infectious disease expert who

to deny entry to all people coming from China to fight the spread of the new coronavirus virus early this month (Feb. 4) said Monday that it may now be too late to prevent a pandemic.





"Unfortunately, it may be a little bit too late because the SARS-CoV2 (which causes COVID-19) has adapted well in Korea and now the main concern is how the government will approach this dire situation and contain it," Hakim Djaballah, former CEO of Institute Pasteur Korea, told The Korea Times. "The Daegu cluster is growing and may spread even further south to Busan and north back to Seoul."





More than 760 people have been confirmed as infected in Korea as of Monday morning, a spike from 16 on Feb. 4. Since emerging in the Chinese city of Wuhan about two months ago, the virus has killed more than 2,400 people and infected nearly 80,000 around the world.





"The measures taken by the government thus far have clearly failed," Djaballah said. "But I still believe that it is time for the government to act by closing the border with China and other countries showing clusters such as Hong Kong and Singapore in the hope of minimizing new virus arriving from there."





At a press conference on Monday, Vice Health Minister Kim Kang-lip said the government would not impose an outright entry ban on all visitors coming from China. The government has restricted those coming from or through China's Hubei Province only since Feb. 2 despite the Korean Medical Association's advice that current measures are insufficient.
