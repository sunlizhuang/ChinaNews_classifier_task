MANILA, Philippines — The Bureau of Immigration (BI) will deport three Chinese nationals and a Korean national who are wanted for fraud in their respective countries.

Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente said Tuesday that the Chinese nationals were arrested in separate operations in Pasay City and Manila by agents of the bureau’s fugitive search unit (FSU).

They were identified as Lin Wengao, 41; Zhang Sen, 38; and Zhang Gaosheng, 39, who are reportedly wanted for involvement in economic crimes in China.

Morente said warrants of arrest were already issued against the three and that their passports were already canceled by the Chinese government.

“We will deport them immediately and they will be included in our blacklist to make sure that they won’t return to the Philippines,” Morente said in a statement.

Citing information from the Chinese Embassy in Manila, Morente said the three Chinese nationals conspired to forge a seal of a hospital in China and managed to defraud victims of more than 10 million RMB or nearly US$1.5 million.

Investigation revealed they arrived separately in the Philippines last year as tourists.

Meanwhile, Korean national Woo Yong Wook, 45, also wanted for fraud by authorities in Seoul, will also be deported, according to Morente.

FSU agents arrested Woo on Friday in Manila after a warrant of deportation was issued against him by the BI board of commissioners.

He was ordered deported after South Korean authorities informed the BI that he is wanted for being the alleged brains behind a fraudulent investment scam that defrauded his victims of more than a billion Won.

BI FSU chief Bobby Raquepo said the four were the first batch of fugitives to be arrested in 2020. He said that in 2019, the BI arrested more than 400 alien fugitives hiding in the country.
