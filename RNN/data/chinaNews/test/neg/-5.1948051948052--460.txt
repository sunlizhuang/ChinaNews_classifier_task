Tehran will review its cooperation with the global nuclear watchdog IAEA if the EU introduces “unjust” steps over the 2015 nuclear deal, which was first abandoned by the US, Iran’s parliament speaker has warned.

Britain, France and Germany formally launched a process, charging Iran with failing to comply with the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on its nuclear program.

Speaker of Iran’s parliament, Ali Larijani, called the decision “unfortunate.”

“We clearly announce that if Europe, for any reason, uses Article 37 of the nuclear agreement unfairly, then Iran will make a serious decision regarding cooperation with the [International Atomic Energy] Agency,” Larijani said on Sunday.

The landmark deal began falling apart in 2018, after Washington withdrew from the agreement and re-imposed sweeping sanctions on Iran. US President Donald Trump claimed that Tehran had been secretly violating the deal. Iran denied this, and the IAEA confirmed that the Islamic Republic was complying with the agreement in its reports at the time. The EU, Russia and China condemned the US for leaving the deal.

A year later, Iran started gradually scaling down its commitments under the JCPOA and said it would return to full compliance once the EU provides some sort of relief from US sanctions. Tehran abandoned the deal completely on January 5, two days after a US drone strike in Iraq killed senior Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani.
