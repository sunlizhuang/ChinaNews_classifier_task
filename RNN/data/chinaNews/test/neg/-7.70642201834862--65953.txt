A doctor in China warned his chat group to be careful of a virus that had been detected in seven patients in the hospital he works in last December.

He told them tests showed the virus was of the coronavirus family, which had been memorable to China because it brought the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003.

This is a story from a CNN feature recently about the doctor who tried to stem a disease that he saw coming, but was punished for it.

“I only wanted to remind my university classmates to be careful,” he is quoted in the article.

A “government coverup” is what the same article states as the reason SARS broke out into a pandemic as it did years ago. In China, it felled about 800 people. Elsewhere in the world, it gave rise to fears much like what many are feeling now with the new coronavirus.

The fear swelled into panic.

Or is it paranoia?

Perhaps not.

Since news broke out that the first person to die of the virus outside of China was in the Philippines, worries have naturally erupted about the capability of our government to handle this emergency.

Unfortunately, recent news has been troubling.

The Department of Health has only reportedly “contacted 17 percent or around 50 of the 331 passengers who may have come in contact with the country’s first two confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), revealing gaps in the government’s protocol for tracking down potentially infected persons.”

This paper’s headline last week was about how senators slammed the department’s “dismal contact tracing measures.”

The Senate hearing on 4 February had solons asking Health Secretary Francisco Duque III how the department was tracking down passengers who had flown in the same plane as the couple who had come from Wuhan, China, one of whom became the first person to die of the virus overseas.

The couple had gone from China to Hong Kong to Cebu, then Dumaguete and Manila. The thought of all people they had traveled with on all flights sent many into hyper-paranoia mode.

Admitting difficulty, Duque faced criticism for the department’s perceived slowness and incompetence in dealing with a virus that won’t wait for people to get their act together.

Once again, lack of coordination was deemed the culprit, which really did not make anyone feel better as the virus was still out there, unknowingly being spread around.

Is it lack of communication stemming from lack of a sense of urgency?

When news broke about the couple, actions should have been coordinated immediately.

Sometimes it just takes common sense. Do we have to wait for official lines before we move?

Until the World Health Organization announced the novel coronavirus as an international concern, it seems not all key agencies made enough effort to act or even just make preparations for prevention. Some are murmuring about politicking getting in the way of public welfare.

This time, it is a matter of life and death. There are no ifs or buts in this scenario. Either we all do or we die.

Just recently, the doctor who tried to warn his friends about the new virus and was “accused of rumor-mongering” passed away. His case should be a lesson for us all.
