NSW health authorities are investigating a fourth possible case of the deadly coronavirus in the state after a patient tested positive during a preliminary examination

NSW Health on Sunday cleared four people who were being investigated for possible infection.

However results showed one patient who was being assessed had tested positive during initial examinations.

Confirmation was expected on Monday.

"Public health follow-up of this probable case is being undertaken in accordance with the national guidelines and the patient remains in isolation," NSW Health said in a statement on Sunday.

"Of the five cases that were under investigation today, four have now been cleared of the infection."

Meanwhile, three infected men, aged 35, 43 and 53, have been isolated in hospital to prevent the virus spreading further and are listed as being in a stable condition.

Two of the men had travelled to the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak - Wuhan - while another man had travelled from the southern city of Shenzhen but had direct contact with a person from Wuhan who was diagnosed with the virus.
