Health professionals will check passengers as they arrive in Sydney from the Chinese city at the centre of the deadly outbreak of coronavirus.

A number of Australians have been tested for the virus which has led to 17 deaths from more than 440 cases in China.

Cases have also been confirmed in Japan, Thailand and South Korea.

Biosecurity measures have been ramped up for flights arriving into Australia from China and Wuhan in particular.

The sprawling capital of central China’s Hubei province is the epicentre of the coronavirus which is thought to have started in animals before spreading to humans.

The three flights Sydney receives from Wuhan each week will be closely monitored, starting on Thursday when biosecurity staff at Sydney Airport will assess any arrivals who feel unwell.

A flight from the Chinese city of Xian via Wuhan is due to arrive at 11.35am on Thursday.

The crack team will include four NSW Health doctors and nurses experienced in public health and infection control alongside virology experts from Westmead Hospital and elsewhere.

Plan in place

The team will wear masks and gloves when examining anyone with symptoms, NSW Health protection executive director Jeremy McAnulty said.

“If it looks like they may have an infection ... we can arrange for testing and management of that person right away,” Dr McAnulty said.

Experts at Westmead Hospital can rapidly diagnose patients although if someone is very unwell they could be taken to a hospital closer to the airport.

Dr McAnulty says identifying potential carriers at the airport is “not foolproof by any means” because people who’ve been exposed to the virus may not display symptoms for days.

Queensland Health on Wednesday confirmed a man who had been isolated after returning from visiting family in the Chinese city of Wuhan does not have the virus.

Australia’s Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says it’s possible the virus will reach Australia, but insists the nation is equipped to respond.

Australia’s foreign affairs department says anyone travelling to Wuhan should “exercise a high degree of caution” while in the city.

Health Minister Greg Hunt said authorities had powers to take those who may be suffering from symptoms directly to hospital.

“But we expect that any passengers that do have issues will self-report because it’s in their own interests,” Mr Hunt said.
