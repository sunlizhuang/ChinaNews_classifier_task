Chinese arrive at Incheon International Airport, west of Seoul, on February 4, after undergoing tougher quarantine and immigration procedures.

South Korea will apply strict quarantine screening to visitors from Hong Kong and Macau, in addition to those arriving from mainland China from tomorrow.

Passengers from China are required to pass through â€œChina-only" arrival counters at airports for suspected symptoms of the Wuhan coronavirus.

Since February 4, South Korea also has implemented entry ban on all foreign travelers who, over the past 14 days, have stayed in or traveled to the Hubei province in China.

Visitors from China are asked to fill out health questionnaires at the moment.

Foreigners are required to write a special quarantine report, providing their mobile phone numbers and domestic stay addresses and disclosing any visit to Hubei province in China, Yonhap reports.

South Korea's 26th and 27th confirmed infected patients had stayed in Guangdong province for three months before returning to Seoul on January 31 via Macau. Neither had been screened on arrival, as their flight stopped over at Macau, according to the country's health authorities.
