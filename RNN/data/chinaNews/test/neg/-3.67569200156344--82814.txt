Years be­fore the CAR-T ther­a­pies Kym­ri­ah and Yescar­ta hit the mar­ket, two French com­pa­nies joined forces in a quest to bring off-the-shelf im­munother­a­pies based on gene-edit­ed al­lo­gene­ic CAR-T cells to fruition.

Now, the play­ers Cel­lec­tis and part­ner Servi­er have amend­ed the terms of their col­lab­o­ra­tion, six years af­ter they first inked a deal to co-de­vel­op Cel­lec­tis’ lead prod­uct can­di­date, UCART19, in ad­di­tion to five oth­er prod­uct can­di­dates tar­get­ing sol­id tu­mors.

Un­der the 2014 deal, Cel­lec­tis re­ceived $10 mil­lion up­front and was el­i­gi­ble to get up to $140 mil­lion for each of the six prod­uct can­di­dates po­ten­tial­ly de­vel­oped. Years lat­er, Servi­er ex­er­cised its op­tion to ac­quire ex­clu­sive glob­al rights to fur­ther de­vel­op and com­mer­cial­ize UCART19. Servi­er and Al­lo­gene, an out­fit run by Kite vets Arie Bellde­grun and re­search chief David Chang, now are work­ing on the ther­a­py to­geth­er and the CD19 ther­a­py is cur­rent­ly is in an ear­ly-stage tri­al for the treat­ment of re­lapsed/re­frac­to­ry acute lym­phoblas­tic leukemia.

On Wednes­day, Cel­lec­tis hand­ed the glob­al li­cense to de­vel­op and sell all next-gen­er­a­tion gene-edit­ed al­lo­gene­ic CAR T-cell can­di­dates tar­get­ing CD19 to Servi­er. In do­ing so, Cel­lec­tis will re­ceive an ad­di­tion­al $26.7 mil­lion up­front and is el­i­gi­ble to get up to $410 mil­lion per prod­uct in mile­stone pay­ments, in ad­di­tion to roy­al­ties.

Mean­while, Cel­lec­tis is set to re­gain ex­clu­sive con­trol over the five undis­closed al­lo­gene­ic CAR-T cell tar­gets pre­vi­ous­ly cov­ered by the ini­tial Servi­er agree­ment.

Ex­ist­ing CAR-T ther­a­pies are en­gi­neered to work in this way: Cells are ex­tract­ed from the pa­tient and then ma­nip­u­lat­ed in a lab where chimeric anti­gen re­cep­tors are added to di­rect the pa­tient’s own T cells to snuff out spe­cif­ic can­cer cells once re-in­fused back in­to the pa­tient. By tar­get­ing CD19, a mark­er present on al­most all B cells, CAR-T ther­a­pies have shown re­mark­able po­ten­cy and dura­bil­i­ty in a num­ber of blood can­cers, in­clud­ing acute lym­phoblas­tic leukemia (ALL).

De­spite their abun­dant promise, the adop­tion of CAR-T ther­a­pies — No­var­tis’ Kym­ri­ah and Gilead’s Yescar­ta — has un­der­whelmed ini­tial ex­pec­ta­tions. The up­take of Kym­ri­ah was plagued by man­u­fac­tur­ing prob­lems, and de­spite No­var­tis’ at­tempt to ex­pand its ca­pac­i­ty, sales con­tin­ue to dis­ap­point com­mer­cial­ly, giv­ing Yescar­ta an edge in the mar­ket.

Mean­while, big side ef­fects — no­tably life-threat­en­ing episodes of cy­tokine re­lease syn­drome and neu­ro­tox­i­c­i­ty — as well as the ther­a­pies’ ex­pen­sive price tags have al­so lim­it­ed their use. A raft of drug de­vel­op­ers in­clud­ing Cel­lec­tis, Servi­er and Al­lo­gene are work­ing on a fix for some of these con­straints by de­vel­op­ing off-the-shelf CAR-T ther­a­pies, de­signed to smoothen man­u­fac­tur­ing com­plex­i­ties by us­ing healthy donor cells.
