Two suspected coronavirus cases at IDH: Early tests negative View(s):

Two Chinese nationals were in the isolation unit of the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) at Angoda on suspicion of having contracted the coronavirus.

Both tested negative “so far” for the disease, said Dr Jayaruwan Bandara, Director of the Medical Research Institute (MRI), last night. The Institute is sent blood samples from the patients and use a test called real-time RT-PCR to make its determination.

Four hi-tech thermal scanning machines from Japan were installed at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) on Tuesday night and became operational on Wednesday. They were bought on a grant and have infrared cameras to detect human skin temperature. Medical officers wearing masks are stationed at the machines watching the screens.

The two-week incubation period of the coronavirus is the main challenge that authorities face in trying to prevent the disease from entering the country, said Dr S.D.A.S. Nishantha, Chief Medical Officer of the Airport and Aviation Services Ltd (AASL). Symptoms can manifest even two weeks after infection.

Many workers at BIA–including some vendors in duty free shops, cleaners and construction workers– were seen wearing masks. Employees, including cabin crew, have been educated on how to pick up on symptoms. Chinese nationals were seen arriving even yesterday, many wearing masks. Their traffic has neither increased nor decreased, airport staff said. Televisions aired advertisements on the coronavirus and it symptoms.

Meanwhile, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa yesterday directed the Foreign Ministry to take steps to evacuate Sri Lankan students and their family members in Wuhan, once the Chinese authorities lift travel restrictions in and out of the city.

Presidential Media Director Mohan Samaranayake told the Sunday Times last night that they would be flown back at government expense, soon after access to the areas was possible.

He said there are about 85 Sri Lankans in Wuhan and nearby areas.

The Foreign Ministry has been directed to obtain assistance from the Sri Lankan Mission and SriLankan Airlines to evacuate the students.
