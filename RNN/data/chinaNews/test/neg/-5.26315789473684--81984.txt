Paris: On a day when global terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) rebuked Pakistan for not being able to take effective measures against money laundering and terror financing, China lauded its "enormous efforts" in combatting terrorism.

Islamabad managed to avoid being blacklisted and continues to be retained in ‘grey list’ until at least June 2020. The FATF warned the country of stern action if it fails to take effective measures on the parameters set by the watchdog to check terror funding to proscribed terror outfits such as Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).

At the end of the six-day plenary in Paris, the 39-member intergovernmental body concluded that Pakistan addressed only a few of the 27 action points given to it to implement and issued a stern warning to it.

China lauds Pakistan's efforts

China, meanwhile, lauded the “enormous efforts” made by Pakistan in combatting terror financing and downplayed reports that it backed India and other countries against Islamabad at the Paris plenary.

China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said Beijing’s position on the matter remains unchanged.

"China's position on the relevant issue remains unchanged. Pakistan has made enormous efforts in improving its counter-terror financing system, which has been recognised by the vast majority of the FATF members at its latest plenary meeting concluded on February 20 in Paris," he told media persons on Friday.

The FATF has given Pakistan more time to be compliant with the 27 parameters set by it and has until June to do so or risk getting blacklisted --a move that is likely to financially isolate Islamabad globally, wreaking havoc on its strained economy.

The development comes a day after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping. During the telephonic conversation, the two premiers decided to take steps at the highest level to further their all-weather strategic co-operative partnership.

China said it is ready to work with relevant parties to offer assistance to Islamabad in its fight against terrorism.

Pakistan fails to comply with FATF action points

After six days of deliberations, the plenary concluded that Islamabad was to be fully compliant on 14 of the 27 parameters set by it. It was able to partially implement 11 action points and found to be completely lacking on two. Areas, where the south Asian nation failed to make progress, include money laundering and terror financing, prosecuting those responsible for funding of terror outfits or activities, transparency in financial institutions among others.

What is FATF?

FATF is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 by G7 group of countries. It sets standards and promotes effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering and terrorist financing.
