A delayed emergency evacuation charter flight carrying British nationals back to the UK from Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of the fast-moving coronavirus outbreak, has been cleared to depart on Friday morning.

The British Government had anticipated repatriating 200 UK citizens out of the country on Thursday, as the World Health Organisation looked set to declare a global health emergency.

But the Telegraph understands the Government had been awaiting Chinese permissions for the airlift. According to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, the evacuation flight will now depart at 5am local time on Friday.

Mr Raab said: “We are pleased to have confirmation from the Chinese authorities that the evacuation flight from Wuhan airport to the UK can depart at 0500 local time on Friday 31 January.

“The safety and security of British nationals is our top priority. Our Embassy in Beijing and consular teams remain in close contact with British nationals in the region to ensure they have the latest information they need.”

The flight is expected to land at a UK military base where those arriving will be quarantined for two weeks. Passengers will only be allowed to travel if they sign a contract agreeing to remain isolated throughout the period.

Former Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell has urged ministers to be more transparent about their decisions surrounding the deadly outbreak.
