. More than 2,000 new cases of infection, 142 deaths confirmed in China.

Americans left cruise ship to be flown home Sunday.

The Canadian government said Saturday it was sending a chartered plane to repatriate the Canadians stuck on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which has been quarantined in Japan due to coronavirus.

"This decision was taken because of the extraordinary circumstances faced by passengers on the Diamond Princess, and to lighten the burden on the Japanese health care system," said a joint statement from Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne, Health Minister Patty Hajdu and Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan. "We are working closely with Carnival Cruise lines and the government of Japan to assist in this evacuation."

The ship has been docked in Yokohama since Feb. 3 carrying around 3,600 passengers and crew.

Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said Saturday another 67 people on the ship tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the total to more than 300 — the biggest cluster of infections outside China.

Canadians who are not showing symptoms of COVID-19 infection will be flown from Japan to Canadian Forces Base Trenton, in Ontario, after which they will be assessed and transported to the NAV Canada Training Institute in Cornwall, Ontario, to undergo a further 14-day period of quarantine.

Anyone showing symptoms of infection will be transferred to the Japanese health system to receive care, and will continue to receive full consular services, the statement said.

8th case reported in Canada

Paul Mirko of Richmond, B.C., is among those quarantined on the ship.

He told CBC News via email on Saturday that Japanese officials are being very thorough with their screenings — noting that it was announced that there will be individual testing starting on Tuesday. He hopes to be back in Canada soon.

"One of my main concerns is that the Canadian government would also quarantine us upon return," said the 63-year-old. "The efficiency and methods of the quarantine here are effective and tough."

Champagne said on Friday that Canadian health workers are assisting in Japan after 15 Canadians contracted the novel coronavirus while on the cruise ship, where 255 Canadians were initially confined to their cabins. Those infected have been moved to Japanese health facilities, and at least three required hospitalization, Champagne said.

Meanwhile, Canada has reported an eighth presumptive case of coronavirus, British Columbia health officials said on Friday, a woman in her 30s from the B.C. Interior who recently travelled to China. There have been four confirmed cases in B.C. and three others in Ontario, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. The risk to Canadians remains low, the agency said.

U.S. also bringing home citizens

American passengers were taken off the cruise liner on Sunday to fly home. An announcement on the public address system aboard the Diamond Princess told Americans to get ready to disembark on Sunday evening for charter flights home. Passengers wearing masks could later be seen waving through the windows of buses parked near the ship.
