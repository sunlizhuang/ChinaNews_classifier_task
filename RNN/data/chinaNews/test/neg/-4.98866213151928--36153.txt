As New Hampshire health officials wait for test results on two patients who might have been exposed to a potentially deadly virus in China, more cases have been confirmed worldwide.>> Download the FREE WMUR appThe World Health Organization said there have been 5,974 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus worldwide, surpassing the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003. But officials said the death rate appears to be about 2%, significantly lower than SARS.Two people in New Hampshire who have experienced respiratory symptoms after visiting the part of China that was the epicenter of the virus continue to improve, doctors said. They remain in isolation as a precaution.State and local agencies are coordinating their procedures for handling the threat. First responders were part of a statewide phone call Wednesday morning to discuss the virus.Symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing. There is no vaccine to protect against infection, and the virus can spread person to person."Typically, when we find someone who is coughing or has a fever, we take universal precautions for everybody," said Chris Stawasz, regional director of American Medical Response.If a patient appears sick, first responders will put a mask on the patient and one on themselves."In these cases, we will wear a mask that takes out particulates from the air, not only to protect the patient but ourselves, as well," Stawasz said.First responders have also been told to ask questions about potential international travel."It's very much like when we had the Ebola scare a few years ago," Stawasz said. "We were asking people if they had traveled to Africa and things along those lines."Officials said the virus has killed more than 100 people in China. Five cases have been confirmed in the United States, and more than 80 people have been tested. Samples for testing are currently sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but public health labs across the country will be able to do their own testing in about two weeks to deal with any other potential cases."We haven't seen a single person in Manchester or Nashua that even comes close to having this, and, of course, it is flu season, so people are sick anyway and these things are out there, so we are taking precautions with everyone we come in contact with," Stawasz said.First responders said anyone who has concerns about symptoms should call a doctor before going to an emergency room.
