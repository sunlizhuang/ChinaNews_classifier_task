A BRITISH teacher says she is in a ''living hell'' stranded in Cambodia after fleeing coronavirus epicentre Wuhan.

Cesca Nicole, 23, started her dream teaching job in China two months ago but left when the deadly outbreak took hold.

She flew to Burma on January 20 for four days before arriving in Phnom Penh.

But when she tried to board an AirAsia flight yesterday, check-in staff noticed she had recently travelled from 'ground zero' Wuhan and detained her for 12 hours.

Cesca, of Wisbech, Cambs, is now banned from leaving Cambodia amid an international lockdown to halt the spread of the killer virus.

She said she has lost thousands of pounds on flights after being denied boarding and is stuck in Phnom Penh.

She and a pal say they have been forced to lodge in grotty hostels and have just £50 between them.

Cesca told the Wisbech Standard: "We are isolated, alone, scared and only have about two days of money left.

"It's such a rough place where we are and at night we just hide in our room in the dark.

"It's like a living hell."

She said she is hoping family will be able to send her money, but she cannot leave as no airlines will let her fly.

She said: "I never expected to be prohibited from getting flights from here.

"It's a pretty awful feeling as we both were looking forward to seeing our families, only to be refused boarding at the last second with no prior warning."

The former Wisbech Grammar School pupil moved to Wuhan to take up a teaching job, but two months later found herself at the centre of a global virus panic.

She said: "It all went crazy and all of Wuhan went into lockdown.

"It's insane as old people there are battering each other just for food and it has turned into a ghost town.

"We have lots of friends in Wuhan who are stranded but because my phone was stolen I cannot keep up to date with what's going on."

The WHO has declared the coronavirus a global health emergency as the death toll today reached 231 with more than 9,000 people infected.

The first two cases were confirmed in the UK this morning as a rescue plane carrying stranded Brits was due to land at RAF Brize Norton.

They will be quarantined in The Wirral - where furious resident accused authorities of spreading it around Britain and fumed: "Why are they coming here?"

Other Brits remain on lockdown in Wuhan after missing the rescue flight.
