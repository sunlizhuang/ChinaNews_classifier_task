The potential evacuation of Irish people stranded in Wuhan in China - which is at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak - is being examined by foreign affairs officials, it emerged yesterday.

A small community of at least six known Irish nationals are in the coronavirus-hit city which is in lockdown to reduce the spread of the killer infection which has struck nearly 3,000 people and caused 81 deaths.

If an emergency airlift goes ahead, the decision on whether to leave would be optional.

A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin said: "Currently we are advising travellers against visiting the province of Hubei, if possible.

"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our embassy in Beijing is in ongoing contact with EU member states and other relevant countries and is exploring options, including commercial options, for assisting Irish citizens to leave Hubei province if required."

She said the embassy was in contact with citizens in Hubei Province "regarding their intentions".

"We would encourage any other Irish citizens in Hubei province, who require assistance, to contact Ireland's embassy in Beijing," she said.

The UK is one of several countries which is moving to arrange travel assistance for British nationals to leave Wuhan. If Irish nationals return here they will have to be assessed by public health officials to determine if they have the virus or may be incubating the illness.

It could mean they will have to stay in isolation for up to 14 days to ensure they are not infected and at risk of spreading the infection.

A Chinese student attending Waterford Institute of Technology, who arrived back in Waterford from Wuhan at the weekend, was in "self-isolation" until yesterday afternoon when he was given the all-clear by HSE public health officials. It is understood the college sought advice from the local public health department and, after the precautionary isolation, he was not deemed to be a risk.

The HSE said it had not identified any possible or suspected cases of the coronavirus infection. There is "no public health requirement for isolation of any person at this point", it added.

It can take up to 14 days to incubate the virus and it is believed an infected person could potentially pass it on during that time, although they may not have the symptoms of a runny nose, cough or high temperature.

Hospitals, GPs and airports have been issued with guidelines on how to manage a suspected case. This would require the person being isolated and health staff wearing goggles and protective clothing.

Pharmacies and other outlets selling facial masks in Dublin have reported a brisk sale in the protective gear in the past week.
