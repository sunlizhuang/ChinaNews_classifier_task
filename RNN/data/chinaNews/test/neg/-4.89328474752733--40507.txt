The 200 South Koreans who were flown home from Wuhan, China, on Friday were met with a mixed reception.

In the city of Asan, where the evacuated residents will be quarantined for 14 days, some residents held up welcome signs.

But others in Asan protested the evacuees' presence, worried that they would bring the coronavirus to the region.

Park Jin-ah is the daughter of a restaurant owner near the health facility where the evacuees will be quarantined. Her entire family is so worried that they are calling for her to leave Asan, she told CNN.

My sister and brother are calling me to move my parents to a safer place," she said.

But Park is more worried about going to Seoul and other areas where infected people may travel before being diagnosed. “I’m not so worried here because all these people from Wuhan came directly from the airport to the quarantine facility,” she added.

Some background: Only people who didn't show any symptoms were allowed to board the flights from Wuhan to South Korea, the government said.

The evacuees are staying in government-provided facilities in Asan and Jincheon, both in Chungcheong Province, and will receive medical check-ups twice a day.
