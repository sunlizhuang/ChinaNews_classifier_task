None of the 11 confirmed cases of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States have occurred in Pennsylvania and the threat to Pennsylvanians remains low, the Pennsylvania Department of Health reported on Monday.

The state, however, says in a news release that it is still preparing in the event that the virus, which is the source of an outbreak in China, eventually touches the Keystone State.

Dr. Rachel Levine, Pennsylvania’s secretary of health, says in a statement that officials are in constant communication with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and are ready to respond in the case that someone in Pennsylvania tests positive for coronavirus.

Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration, in an effort to combat misinformation, is stressing that Asian American/Pacific Islander individuals are at no higher of a risk of carrying the coronavirus than any other individual.

The efforts are appreciated by those in the Asian American/Pacific Islander community, according to Mohan Seshadri, executive director of the Governor’s Advisory Commission on Asian Pacific American Affairs.

“Too often, national security and public health crises have led to the demonization of particular groups of people, and we are committed to ensuring that that does not happen here,” Seshadri says. "Our thoughts and prayers are with our fellow Americans and those in China fighting the virus, as well as with our Chinese American community members worried for their families.”

Levine reminds residents that they are much more likely to become sick with a cold or the flu than to be diagnosed with coronavirus. More than 45,000 diagnosed cases of flu and 33 deaths have been recorded since October in Pennsylvania alone.

The novel coronavirus was first detected in December in China. The majority of the cases have occurred there, but have also spread to other countries, most of them associated with travel. Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. The symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure. Reported illnesses have ranged from people with little to no symptoms to people being severely ill and dying, the news release from the state says.

The release provides the following guidance: If you have traveled to China in the last 14 days, or come into direct contact with someone who has, and feel sick with fever, cough, or have difficulty breathing, you should seek medical care right away. Before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.
