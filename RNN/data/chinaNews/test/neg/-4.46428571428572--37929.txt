Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Thursday he doesn't want to take a "victory lap" concerning the deadly coronavirus outbreak, but he speculated that the disease will help "accelerate" the return of jobs to the United States.

"The fact is, it does give businesses yet another thing to consider when they go through their review of their supply chains," Ross told Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo. "It's another risk factor that people need to take into account. I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America, some to the U.S., probably some to Mexico as well."

Ross, though, said that coronavirus is a "very unfortunate, very malignant disease, and he thinks that "every American's heart has to go out to the victims."

Bartiromo noted that companies will have to "have an alternative once they shut down things in China, is what you're saying," to which Ross responded "absolutely."

"You've already heard Apple talking about figuring out how to replace some of the Chinese production," said Ross. "You had others also doing the same thing. And so I think there's a confluence of factors.

A Commerce Department spokesperson told The Hill that Ross had made it clear that the "first step is to bring the virus under control and help the victims of this disease."

"It is also important to consider the ramifications of doing business with a country that has a long history of covering up real risks to its own people and the rest of the world," the spokesperson said.

Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin on Thursday signed an order to close Russia's border with China in its Far East region in an effort to stop the spread of the deadly Wuhan coronavirus, which has killed at least 170 people in China as of Thursday morning.

Ross also discussed the new United States-Canada-Mexico trade agreement, telling Bartiromo that with USMCA, the chances of a recession in 2020 are virtually impossible.
