However, her condition is stable now. The girl’s family is under home quarantine as a part of precautionary measures.

Health officials on alert in state, says minister

As many as 39 samples, including the alternative sample of the infected girl have been sent to NIV, Pune, of which 24 results were out, including the positive confirmation. “Though many have been tested negative for infection, we have to be very careful until the incubation period of 28 days gets over. Surveillance in the state has been tight and health officials and volunteers are on alert across the state,” said Shailaja.
