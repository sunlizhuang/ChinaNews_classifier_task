One of the biggest questions among City Hall insiders last week was why Public Works Director Mohammed Nuru would risk up to 20 years in jail, the loss of his reputation and — worse — his pension on a two-bit bribery scheme aimed at helping a friend open a chicken shack at SFO.

The answer may be buried deep in the federal criminal complaint and involves rolling the dice on an even bigger play down the line.

Here’s the story.

Nuru made a career of doing favors, even if it meant bending the rules a bit to get the job done.

“If Civic Center or some street was a mess and you needed it cleaned up that night for a big opening, you would call Mohammed and it would get done,” said Stanlee Gatti, one of the city’s leading event planners.

“Sometimes he would cut corners, and we would ask him, ‘Is this legitimate?’ But it always appeared to be for the public good,” said one Public Works higher-up who asked not to be named because of the investigation.

There was never any talk, however, of Nuru, who makes $273,406 a year, asking for cash.

Emerald Fund developer Oz Erickson, a major developer in town, backed that up. “Never once has anyone told me he was asking for bribes, and I’ve built 3,000 units of housing in this city since 1979 and worked with a lot of contractors,” Erickson said.

And nowhere in the 75-page criminal complaint against Nuru and his alleged partner in crime, restaurateur Nick Bovis, is there mention of Nuru taking money.

As Bovis told FBI undercover operatives wearing wires, Nuru “knows how to cover his back on all this stuff so it’s not a conflict or nothing,” according to the complaint.

Instead, Nuru is accused of accepting favors and gifts.

According to federal investigators, Nuru used his City Hall position to help a billionaire Chinese developer and hotel magnate Zhang Li deal with problems at the Department of Building Inspection over defective glass panels he was using at a condominium and mixed-use project at 555 Fulton St.

In return, the complaint states, Nuru was treated to first-class vacations in China and South America.

“He doesn’t give money or anything,” Nuru said of the developer in an FBI wiretap. “He lets us stay in his hotels and stuff. He makes all the arrangements for us, which is good. And nice places,” Nuru is quoted as saying in the criminal complaint.

The most serious charges revolve around Nuru and his longtime friend Bovis, owner of the now-closed Lefty’s Ballpark Buffet and Gold Dust Lounge. They’re accused of conspiracy for allegedly trying to bribe former Airport Commissioner Linda Crayton to help Bovis and two FBI informants win a lease for a chicken restaurant at San Francisco International Airport.

Nuru allegedly also gave Bovis inside information to help him bid on Public Works contracts for public toilets and homeless shelters.

And, the FBI says, the two cooked up a scheme in which Bovis, whose Fisherman’s Wharf restaurant was hurting, would supply meal vouchers to Public Works employees working on Thanksgiving. Nuru would later reimburse Bovis for half of the cost of the “free tickets” out of his department budget, the FBI says.

A company that pours concrete for Public Works projects also provided employees to work on Nuru’s Colusa County vacation home near Mendocino National Forest, the complaint alleges. Pretty much small potatoes, by criminal standards.

“Maybe it was hubris, or ego. He just saw himself as being the guy who can get things done,” the Public Works source said.

Or, maybe there was a grander scheme at work, like building a casino together with the help of Chinese investors.

Buried deep in the FBI documents is a snippet of a conversation between Nuru and Bovis, in which they talk about their plans to build a casino on 147 acres at an undisclosed Northern California location.

In one phone tap, Nuru and Bovis discuss a photograph of the site.

“It’s huge,” Nuru says.

“Yeah, I can get, I can get the guys to help them with the casino license for sure,” Bovis says.

The transcript doesn’t spell out who “the guys” are that Bovis is referring to, but later in the conversation Nuru tells Bovis he has a contact “who’s getting me all the information through those guys, these guys. ... These guys, they own casinos in, uh, China.”

Doing favors for wealthy China hotel developers who might help swing a casino deal?

Now that would have been a real payoff.
