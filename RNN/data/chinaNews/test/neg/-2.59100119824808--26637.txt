The Toronto man now in Sunnybrook Hospital suffering from the suspected coronavirus was showing symptoms of the deadly strain on his flight home from China to Canada, federal officials revealed Sunday.

The man —in his 50s — was returning from ground zero of the virus, Wuhan, to Toronto last Tuesday on China Southern Airlines Flight number CZ311.

The victim is in isolation and his family members are in “self-isolation” as a precaution, Ontario health officials said Saturday.

Highly-contagious coronavirus began emerging on Dec. 31 and officials believe it may have come from snakes sold at illegal wildlife markets.

Since then, the disease has spread rapidly around the world.

More than 2,000 people are now affected — mostly in China — and so far, at least 56 of the virus’ victims have died.

But researchers fear the real number could be double because of the virus’ rapid transmission.

Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, told reporters on Sunday that authorities are “working rapidly” to trace any passengers who came into contact with the man.

“We’ll be looking at the plane and its seating plan and where that patient was actually seated in order to trace other passengers,” Tam said.

“The main focus is on actual fellow travellers [or others who may have cared for him during the flight],” Tam said.

And the high-ranking health official offered an ominous warning.

“It would not be unexpected that there will be more cases imported into Canada in the near term,” she said.

But she cautioned that the risk of the man infecting others is low.

However, Canada’s first case of coronavirus failed to report to immigration officials that he was sick when he arrived at Pearson International Airport.

At the airport on arrival screens is a warning telling passengers disembarking from Wuhan to tell authorities if they have flu-like symptoms.

It wasn’t until his family called 911 on Thursday when his illness became severe did officials learn the man likely had the coronavirus.

Among the latest news on the spread of the coronavirus:

— The fifth U.S. case was confirmed Sunday in Arizona by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. California confirmed two more cases in Los Angeles and Orange county.

— The World Health Organization’s decision to hesitate in calling the outbreak “a public health emergency of international concern” has come under fire. So far coronavirus is only considered an “emergency” in China.

— Chinese Health Minister Ma Xiaowei said Sunday that the virus can spread before symptoms show making the illness harder to contain and quarantine.

— The outbreak is also hurting China’s economy: Travel on the Lunar New Year Saturday was down almost 29%.

— Canadian Health Minister Patty Hadju said at this point, her government has no plans to evacuate diplomats and their families from the stricken area.

Meanwhile, Canadian researchers are still trying to determine whether the man at Sunnybrook is still “presumptive” or “positive”.

In Toronto, public health officials are contacting people, particularly passengers who had “prolonged contact” with the man.

“What I would like to emphasize is that for other people on the flight, or in the airport or not in close contact with the patient is that they should not be overly concerned,” Tam said.

“For the rest of the plane, if you don’t get a call from public health authorities, it means you were not right next to the two-metre radius of that particular patient,” she said.

Symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Most affected are older people and those with pre-existing health conditions.
