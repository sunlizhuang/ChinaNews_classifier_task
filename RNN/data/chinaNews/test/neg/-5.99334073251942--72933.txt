Sunday, Feb. 16, 8 p.m.

Taiwan reported (link in Chinese) two new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, including its first death from the new coronavirus, bringing the region’s total confirmed cases to 20.

The man who passed away on Saturday evening had not traveled outside the island and was not known to have had close contact with any confirmed Covid-19 patient, the local health authority said.

Sunday, Feb. 16, 5 p.m.

Japan’s health ministry confirmed (link in Japanese) another 70 Covid-19 cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship on Sunday. It is a new peak in the daily tally of confirmed new cases on the ship since the outbreak was discovered there, the biggest virus cluster outside China so far.

The number of total confirmed cases reached 355, nearly one in 10 of the 3,771 passengers and crew on board, bringing Japan’s confirmed cases to 408.

The spike in cases has raised concerns that the virus could spread quickly in Japan. Katsunobu Kato, Japan’s minister of health, labor and welfare, admitted on Saturday that authorities were not sure how several patients in the country had contracted the virus. This makes the government’s assessment of the epidemic different from the previous situation, he said.

The ship has been quarantined since Feb. 5 off the coast of Yokohama, a port city south of Tokyo, after a passenger who had stayed on board from Jan. 20 to Jan. 25 was confirmed infected on Feb. 1.

The Japanese government has been criticized (link in Chinese) for its handling of the emergency on the ship. Passengers were forced to stay in rooms which did not receive cleaning services or changes of bedding. Some rooms do not have windows, which may raise the risk of cross-infection.

Wuhan virology institute denies rumors

The Wuhan Institute of Virology has denied online rumors that one of its graduates was “patient zero” of the coronavirus outbreak. The institute has been the subject of numerous rumors and conspiracy theories since the outbreak began.

A statement (link in Chinese) from the institute said the student in question is healthy, has been working outside Hubei province, and has not gone back to Wuhan since graduation.

“Patient zero” refers to the first person to contract and spread a virus, beginning an epidemic. In the Covid-19 outbreak, patient zero remains unknown. An article published in British medical journal The Lancet studying the first batch of 41 patients in Wuhan said that the symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec. 1.

Lab researchers and medical experts around the world have also denied rumors that the virus was man-made or leaked by the lab. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is the only P4 level biosafety laboratory in China, the country’s highest level of biosecurity.
