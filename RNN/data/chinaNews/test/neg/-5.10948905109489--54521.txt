Approximately 350 Americans are set to arrive at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield after being evacuated from Wuhan, China, the center of the coronavirus outbreak. Two flights from Wuhan are due to arrive on American soil today. One will drop passengers off to be quarantined at Travis, while the other flight will head to Miramar Marine Corps Air Station in San Diego following the planeâ€™s refueling. Both groups will be quarantined at the two bases for two weeks in an effort to prevent the spread of the highly contagious virus. Officials from Travis Air Force Base say they are only providing housing for the returning Americans, while Health and Human Services staff will handle all care, security, and transportation for the evacuees.
