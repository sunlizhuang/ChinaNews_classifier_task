THE Philippines yesterday reported the growing epidemic of a coronavirus has claimed its first fatality outside of China.

In China, new confirmed infections jumped by a daily record to top 14 000 cases.

The Philippines Department of Health said a 44-year-old man from Wuhan in central Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, had died in a Manila hospital after developing severe pneumonia.

It was the first death out of more than 130 cases reported in about two dozen countries and regions outside of mainland China.

The man who died was with a 38-year-old Chinese woman, also from Wuhan, who was the first and only other person to test positive for the virus in the Philippines. Both patients arrived in the Philippines via Hong Kong on 21 January.

China’s death toll from the outbreak reached 304 as of the end of Saturday.

The country faces isolation as other countries introduce travel curbs, airlines suspend flights and governments evacuate their citizens. Russia introduced visa restrictions and will start evacuating citizens today.

The Philippines expanded its travel ban to include all foreigners coming from China, not only those from Hubei province.

New Zealand and Vietnam barred foreigners who’ve been in China. Vietnam said it would halt all flights to and from China.

Taiwan wants to ensure flights are not cut off due to its inclusion by the World Health Organisation as part of China. – REUTERS
