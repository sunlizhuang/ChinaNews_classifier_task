Chinese production is traditionally low in January and February, as many factories close for the Lunar New Year holiday. Most retailers and their suppliers build up inventories towards the end of the calendar year to tide them over until normal production cycles and shipments resume after the holidays.

"That means that shelves are well stocked now and will remain so for several months, but any significant delay in production starting up again will impact supply chains in the second quarter of 2020," Mr Pitman said.

As the extent of the disruption became clearer, retailers and suppliers would have to decide whether to source goods from other countries or air freight goods from China to shorten lead times, he said.

Morgans analysts Jo Little and James Barker said most factories had been asked to remain closed for one to two weeks after Chinese New Year and some planned to remain closed until the end of February.

Most retailers could handle this delay with limited fallout, but if factories remained closed for a month or more after the holidays stocks could run short, hurting sales and earnings in the short term.

Retailers with higher stock turns and tighter inventory positions, such as fast-fashion retailers, would see a greater impact in the short term, the analysts said.

Woolworths, Myer, Wesfarmers, Bunnings and Kmart Group said they were monitoring the situation closely, including the health and wellbeing of staff.

But because many factories had shut down due to the holidays and the coronavirus, there was little information about how long it might take for production to return to normal.

"In China they extended Chinese New Year for a few extra days and it's only this week anyone has been back to the office," said a Kmart Group spokesman.

"We are trying to get information from suppliers about what it means and if there are mitigations we need to put in place."

The Kmart Group has diversified its supply chain and sources stock from China as well as Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. "It's certainly not panic stations," the spokesman said.

Woolworths, Myer, Coles and Kmart/Target have sourcing offices in Shanghai and Hong Kong employing hundreds of staff, some of whom have been asked to work from home.

"At this stage, we haven't seen any disruptions to supply or procurement across the group," said a Woolworths spokesman.

A Myer spokesman said it was monitoring health alerts and keeping staff in its China offices updated on developments and on how to protect themselves.

"At this stage, no team members in China have been affected. There are no current supply chain issues," the spokesman said.

A Wesfarmers spokeswoman said there had been no disruption to its supply chain. "Our priority is to make sure our team are safe and as a precaution ... all travel for business has been suspended to China and Hong Kong for the time being," she said.

Bunnings, part of the Wesfarmers conglomerate, also said its supply chain was unaffected.

"We source products from thousands of different suppliers, from all parts of the world, and have options to source from elsewhere should supply from one of those areas be affected," said managing director Mike Schneider.
