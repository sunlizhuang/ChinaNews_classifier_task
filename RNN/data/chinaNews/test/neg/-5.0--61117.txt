The lethal coronavirus outbreak that began in China and is spreading could prove damaging to the global cruise ship industry if not contained within a month, experts said, putting a business that serves millions of people worldwide in unprecedented turbulence.

Shares for Carnival Corporation, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean International, all major Miami-based brands that serve Chinese ports, have dropped between 8% and 14% since the coronavirus outbreak began, said Brandt Montour, a gaming and lodging analyst for J.P Morgan.

The market reaction comes as a stream of coronavirus screenings and outbreaks at sea draw government and media attention and the deadly virus sweeps across the globe. Several cruise ships have been held in ports in Japan and Hong Kong with thousands of passengers stuck aboard.

Four passengers on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship that docked in Bayonne on Friday were sent to the hospital after they were screened for coronavirus, Gov. Phil Murphy said. One of the four later tested positive for the flu.

“If you are sick, don’t travel,” said Robert Quigley, senior vice president of International SOS, a global security and medical risk firm. Passengers with symptoms “could get put in quarantine but just have the flu.”

The four people sent to the hospital from the Bayonne ship were among nearly 30 passengers who had recently traveled to China and were screened. The rest of the ship's passengers were released without additional evaluation.

Confirmed cases on a Princess Cruises ship quarantined south of Tokyo soared to 61, including at least eight Americans, Japanese authorities said Friday.

“There’s been significant transmission,” Centers for Disease Control Director Robert Redfield said during a news conference Friday.

Officials screened about 270 of more than 3,700 passengers and crew on the ship anchored near Tokyo. More than 400 Americans are onboard.

Being stuck inside cabins with irregular meals and minimum fresh air isn’t exactly an ideal vacation, but “the vast majority of people are being responsible,” Quigley said.

The quarantine is set to end Feb. 19, barring any “unforeseen developments,” Princess Cruises said in a statement Thursday. The company also amended and canceled upcoming trips with stops in Shanghai though early June.

Also quarantined at sea is a ship operated by Dream Cruises, which is isolated in Hong Kong as a precaution after three previous passengers tested positive for the virus. More than 3,600 people are onboard.

The ultimate financial impact is still unknown, but Montour in an analysis this week offered some possible scenarios based on previous virus- and cruise ship-driven debacles.

The 2003 SARS outbreak, often used as a benchmark for the coronavirus, likely contributed to lower share prices for cruise line companies throughout that year. But experts say it’s impossible to untangle the Iraq War and other global travel issues from SARS as possible causes.

The swine flu outbreak in 2009 also had an impact, Montour said, but it happened too close to the financial crisis to be a reliable indicator. Swine flu discovery on ships didn’t precipitate a major negative impact to the industry.

More indicative of the final coronavirus effect could be the Carnival Triumph incident in 2013, Montour said. An engine room fire caused the Triumph to lose power, leaving 4,000 passengers stranded for days in the Gulf of Mexico. Both Carnival and Royal Caribbean shares suffered, but rebounded six months later.

Shares also waivered when the Italian Costa Concordia ran aground and overturned outside Tuscany in 2012, killing 33 people. Carnival shares were at -16% but bounced back to -1% in six months; meanwhile, Royal Caribbean, with share prices at 0% around the time of the accident, dropped to -18%.

The best-case scenario — if the virus slows during February and China sailings restart in March — would leave a lowered but manageable drop in global demand. It would also keep China revenues down 10% the rest of the year.

In what Montour calls a “downside case,” cruises to China would be canceled through March and China revenues would be down 15% annually. Shares for the three major cruise lines would drop further, leaving a slightly greater impact on the industry worldwide.

Montour in the report said the final numbers will likely fall between those two cases.

But in the worst possible situation, if the virus continues to spread and China cruises are canceled through the summer, share prices would plummet to -30%.

Most cruise ship brands, fearing prolonged impact, are implementing widespread screening processes. The requirements for screening are fluid, but the threshold is already low, Quigley said.

“We’re probably going to start seeing more stringent guidelines,” he added.

Brands that are members of Cruise Lines International Association — more than 90% of the worldwide ocean-going cruise capacity — were issued an “enhanced” round of guidance Friday.

According to the policies, ships should deny boarding to people who visited China, including Hong Kong and Macau, less than 14 days before the cruise. They should also deny entrance to people who cared for or had close contact with anyone suspected or diagnosed with coronavirus, also within the prior 14 days.

Princess Cruises on Wednesday said crew members from China were prohibited from boarding ships until further notice. The company also instituted pre-boarding medical evaluations for people with fevers or respiratory symptoms.

“It’s the worst place to be if there’s a virus or infectious disease,” Quigley said of cruise ships, likening them to “a large petri dish.”

The tight environment, combined with lack of airflow, common surfaces and little sunlight in some cabins, helps germs thrive, said David Allan, chief of infectious diseases at Rutgers Medical School.

“It’s not a coincidence that people get colds in the winter because people tend to stay inside more, they keep their doors and windows closed, and it becomes more crowded,” he said. “A cruise ship is that at a more concentrated level.”

Health officials are following guidelines like those issued for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, a rare illness that spreads through small droplets from sneezes or coughs, Allan added.

Whether the coronavirus can be transmitted to people who touch a contaminated surface is unknown, he said.

Ships must also make ad hoc plans in case screening and onboard medical assistance fail, Quigley said. In Japan, that has meant airlifting or using Japanese Coast Guard watercraft to extract infected passengers and take them to hospitals.

Cruise-goers tend to be older people “at the extremes of life,” he added, making them more vulnerable to the most severe virus symptoms.

But concern in the U.S. remained low Friday as the outbreak spread, with ships that aren’t coming from or heading to China considered safe.

“You’re really dependent on the place of origin of your crew,” Redfield said. “If you’re going on a cruise ship in the Caribbean ... it’s really no risk.”

There are more than 31,000 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, U.S. officials said Friday.

Chinese health authorities on Friday said the number of deaths there havetopped 600.

A 2020 schedule for Bayonne's Cape Liberty Cruise Port listed Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises and TUI Cruises as local lines. An eight-night Bahamas cruise was set to leave the port Friday.

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday confirmed a case of the virus in Wisconsin, the 12th in the U.S. Earlier U.S. cases were confirmed in Washington, Arizona, Illinois, California and Massachusetts

A traveler who arrived at Newark Airport from China was issued a 14-day quarantine, although the person did not present any symptoms of coronavirus, officials said. Newark Airport is among 11 U.S. airports still accepting flights from China.

Health officials cleared two individuals in New Jersey who were tested for the virus in late January.
