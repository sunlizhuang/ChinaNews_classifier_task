The 80-year-old Chinese man died after spending two weeks in intensive care in the French capital - bringing the grisly death toll to 1,527.

French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn confirmed he had passed away this morning - and revealed the man's daughter had also been treated.

It comes as NHS England today confirmed all but one of the nine people treated in the UK for coronavirus have been discharged from hospital.

Tourist hotspot France has so far recorded 11 cases of the virus out the current worldwide total of 67,000.

The man arrived in France on January 16 from virus-ridden Hubei - home to coronavirus ground zero Wuhan.

His condition "deteriorated rapidly" and he was left fighting for life in Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital in the north of Paris on January 25.

But he died from a "pulmonary infection with Coronavirus", while his daughter is due to be released soon, Ms Buzyn confirmed.

She added: "This is the first death from the Coronavirus outside Asia, the first death in Europe."

FEARS FOR BRITS

Paris is home to 2.1million people and last year overtook London to become the most popular tourist city in Europe and third most popular in the world.

The French capital attracts 19.1million tourists every year - with 12.7million Brits flocking to France each year.

It comes as an expert warned the deadly bug has the "potential" to kill 400,000 Brits if it sweeps across the nation.

Professor Neil Ferguson said the figure is "not absurd" and the deadly disease “concerns” him more than any other illness he has worked on.

Experts have claimed that up to 60 per cent of the world could contract coronavirus – a figure that could also be applicable to Britain.

This virus is the one which probably concerns me the most out of everything I’ve worked on. Professor Neil Ferguson

Out of the infected population it is estimated that 1 per cent could die, which in the UK’s case would be hundreds of thousands of people.

Professor Ferguson, from the School of Public Health, Imperial College London, told Channel 4 this number is "not absurd".

He added: “I would much prefer to be accused of overreacting than under reacting.

“This virus is the one which probably concerns me the most out of everything I’ve worked on.”

Nine confirmed cases have been treated in the UK so far - with just one left in hospital - after now testing negative twice for the disease.

The last of those at Arrowe Park in quarantine in the Wirral after returning from Wuhan have also been released.

But more than 100 still remain in isolation at Kents Park Hill Hotel in Milton Keynes.

As of Friday, a total of 2,964 people have been tested in the UK, of which 2,955 were confirmed negative.

NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said on Thursday that many more people in the UK may need to self-isolate to contain the illness, which has been officially named Covid-19.

This morning it was revealed two Labour MPs have self-isolated over coronavirus fears after going to a London bus conference attended by an infected patient.

MPs IN ISOLATION

Alex Sobel, MP for Leeds NW, tweeted earlier today he was being tested as one of 250 people who may have come into contact with the killer bug.

The infected person is said to have visited the UK Bus Summit in Westminster on February 6 where Boris Johnson's Buses Minister, Baroness Vere of Norbiton, was star speaker.

Mr Sobel wrote on Twitter: “Whilst I have been informed that I am at very low risk, I have called 111 to be formally assessed."

And another Labour MP who went to the conference, Lillian Greenwood, today said she is cancelling all her public engagements and is at home to be "extra cautious".

There is now growing panic the patient could have infected any of the hundreds of people who attended the packed conference at the QEII centre.

It is also not clear whether she took a taxi or a Tube to the talk - sparking fears more Londoners could have been exposed to the virus, which has killed 1,384 people.

It is understood the person is the not the Chinese woman who hopped in an Uber and arrived at Lewisham Hospital in a huge breach of public health advice.
