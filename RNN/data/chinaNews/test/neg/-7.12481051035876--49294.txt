SUDESH Amman had been released from prison for a matter of days when he took a knife and stabbed two innocent people in a terrorist attack on Streatham High Street on Sunday.

The ‘knife-obsessed’ 19-year-old had been serving a three-year term for terror offences - but was set free on automatic early release after just 18 months, despite security services considering him to be highly dangerous.

Shockingly, he is one of around 500 convicted terrorists who have been released in the UK in the last decade - and one of 74 released on licence under the automatic early release scheme, introduced in 2005.

According to the Mirror, MI5 and the police are monitoring at least 20 jihadi extremists on a daily basis in a bid to keep our streets safe.

Many of these jihadis are back living on the same streets where they were radicalised and more are set to be released within months.

The government has today unveiled a new “emergency law” to end early release for terrorists - but it’s unclear when the rule change will come into effect.

And disturbing research from the Henry Jackson Society, a think-tank which has tracked jihadis in Britain, shows some of the most serious dangerous offenders were allowed out to plan more attacks.

Usman Khan, who stabbed two people to death and injured three more in the London Bridge attack in November, was freed despite a judge saying he should never be let out.

A definitive list of all the jihadis currently roaming British streets is not publicly available - but here we reveal the faces of some of the convicted killers and hate preachers at large in the UK.

Kazi Rahman, 43, is Kazi Islam's uncle and neighbour - and a convicted terrorist in his own right.

Shockingly, he was released from prison in 2011.

Usman Khan was convicted in 2012 for a string of al-Qaeda-inspired terror offences, including a plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange.

He was sentenced to an “indeterminate sentence” with a minimum of eight years, but this was overturned on appeal in 2013, allowing Khan to automatically be released.

He was allowed out of Belmarsh Prison on temporary release licence in December 2018. He was considered a success story of a Cambridge University rehab programme, having befriended staff including of Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones, who he later stabbed to death before he was shot dead by police on London Bridge in December.

He was arrested in 2010 and given an indeterminate sentence which was changed to a fixed-term 17-year sentence on appeal in 2013, meaning he was eligible for early release.

He is believed to have been released in 2018, after serving eight and half years including remand.

Houria accidentally dropped a memory stick containing a “mini-encyclopedia of weapons-making” from beneath her burka at Liverpool John Lennon Airport in October 2008.

She pleaded guilty to two terror offences.

She was sentenced to two years in November 2009, but she was free to go (having already served 382 days on remand since her arrest).

Did we take our eye off the ball? Terror expert Dr Paul Stott, of the Henry Jackson Society, tells The Sun: “From 2018 there were a lot of people being released in a very short time but the focus seemed to be on those people returning from Syria and Iraq and how dangerous they would be. “It missed the fact that there was a real challenge in the people who were being released who've already got convictions, who missed out on the opportunity to go to Syria and Iraq to live in their ‘perfect society’. So they're angry, they're likely to lash out. “When you look at the detail of these last two attacks, it's not organised. It's about flailing about with anger.” One in seven of the convicted terrorists released since 2010 had their sentences reduced or were freed through the early release system. But Dr Stott says that in some cases, prison is strengthening radical views. “With the networks within prisons like-minded people can associate together and reinforce those views,” he says. “We saw that during the conflict in Northern Ireland and I think we're clearly seeing it again, with the jihadi prisoners. They are providing mutual support for one another in prison so they're not being reformed.” But he says terrorists like Amman are acting alone, with no backing from formal organisations. "It's a different type of terrorism from what we might have seen in earlier decades where it's much more centrally directed. These people are taking inspiration from them and then acting themselves."

Khuram Iqbal

Cardiff Student Iqbal called himself “the father of terrorism” and posted over 800 links to extremist material online.

He also attempted to join the Jihadist cause when he fled to Kenya in 2011, but he was deported after being arrested 12 miles from the Somali border.

He was arrested in October 2013 and, at 21, was sentenced to three years and three months in September 2014.



Mohammed Benares

Birmingham postie Mohammed Benares, one of Choudary's henchmen, was caged for two years in 2013 after downloading an online al-Qaeda magazine "glorifying" terrorism.

The 44-year-old was arrested with 53 copies of Inspire, which detailed how to make bombs and plan atrocities.

Police also found copies of a document called 39 Ways to Serve and Participate in Jihad and speeches by al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden.

Benares claimed to be “researching” extremism, but was convicted of possessing terrorist information at London’s Southwark Crown Court.

Despite the shocking offence, he was released well before his sentence was up.

Another of the cell jailed for the Stock Exchange plot with Usman Khan, Rahman was sentenced to five years, in 2012, after admitting to owning copies of an al-Qaeda magazine for terrorist purposes, which included a recipe for a pipe bomb.

Released “six months early” because his lawyer argued he was undertaking “de-radicalisation” in jail, he was jailed again in August 2017 for plotting a “mass casualty attack” targeting police or military with two other men.

They were caught when a sting operation found a partially complete pipe bomb and meat cleaver with the Arabic word for “nonbeliever” in the car of one of the co-conspirators, Naweed Ali.

He’s currently serving life with a minimum of 20 years over the 2017 conviction.

Soon to be released

The convicted terrorists and extremists back walking our streets could soon be joined by a new wave of dangerous characters.

Other jihadi lags are expected to be released from prison on licence in upcoming months - including Sheffield con Khalil Maher, 24, who tried to secretly travel to Syria to join the Islamic State.

Maher - who was arrested at Heathrow Airport - was jailed for five years, four months, in November 2017, but is understood to be due out of prison later this month after serving just half his sentence.

And Sunderland shopkeeper Mohammed Zahir Khan, 41, is thought to be due for release in the next few months, too - despite being jailed for more than four years in May 2018 for posting support for ISIS online.

Sunday's Streatham attack has shone a light on the UK's automatic early release laws - which have been slammed for leaving our neighbourhoods "unsafe" and allowing jihadists to "ignite terror" across the nation.

But if PM Boris Johnson gets his way, the waves of convicted terrorists returning to the streets could soon become trickles, or nothing at all.

Vowing to crack down on the early release of terrorist prisoners, Mr Johnson said today: "I think the question that everybody has about the individual concerned [in the Streatham attack] is, what was he doing out on automatic early release, and why was there no system of scrutiny, no parole system, to check whether he was really a suitable candidate for automatic early release.

"And that is a very complex legal question. We do think it's time to take action.

"I hope people understand that the anomaly we need to clear up is the process by which some people are still coming out under automatic early release without any kind of scrutiny or parole system."
