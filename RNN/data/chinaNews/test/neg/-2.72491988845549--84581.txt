For the first time in history, breathable oxygen from another galaxy -- aside from Milky Way that has our Solar System -- is now discovered by scientists.

It has the same structure and elements just like what we have here on our planet Earth and may help you to solve your inner thoughts of traveling to other planets-- just in case Earth did not stop from Coronavirus or any world issues existing today.

Scientists discover breathable oxygen! No need to worry, as so you can live outside Earth!

Oxygen is a living essential. Compared to other galaxies and planets, planet Earth has this element in order for living creatures to survive on this planet. Once it was abused and compromised, all living elements on this planet may die in an instant.

Since it is vital, scientists all over the world have been formulating studies on finding alternatives for this essential need. On Jan. 30, a new finding was discovered by the researchers from Shanghai Astronomical Observatory that explains how a human essential like oxygen can now be used and detected in a galaxy far far away from the Milky Way.

Want to live outside Earth? Breathable oxygen now discovered in another galaxy

According to the report on The Astrophysical Journal, the team found the "first detection of extragalactic molecular oxygen" found outside the Milky Way. But what is it?

The team led by Junzhi Wang has reported that the galaxy called Markarian 231-- located 581 million light-years from the Milky Way-- has been releasing the same breathable oxygen that Earth has.

Using radio telescopes, the team made progress on tracking oxygen on other galaxies with Markarian 231's radiation at a wavelength of 2.52 millimeters-- which identifies that the galaxy has an equal and the highest amount of oxygen besides Earth.

"O2 may be a significant coolant for molecular gas in such regions affected by AGN-driven outflows," the researchers noted. "New astrochemical models are needed to explain the implied high molecular oxygen abundance in such regions several kiloparsecs away from the center of galaxies."

False alert: You cannot live outside Earth even if there's alternative to oxygen

Though it was said that oxygen is an essential need for all living creatures and another galaxy has the same breathable oxygen with Earth, these facts do not imply that you can just go to Markarian 231 and breathe all your lungs out there.

The reason behind this is that oxygen is not the only thing that is needed by a living body to survive on the planet. Humans, specifically, need other elements mixed with oxygen, such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, and all the different molecules that make Earth's air breathable to humans and other organisms.

So if you're thinking of flying outside the planet and look for another home, especially now that reports of Coronavirus or COVID-19 of being an 'airborne' disease are spreading worldwide, scientists clarified that you could not just do this and live in Markarian 231.

However, the fact that another galaxy has the same breathable oxygen as Earth is a massive discovery in space. And who knows in the next years, we can really live outside Earth.
