Chinese authorities are placing coronavirus patients into mass quarantine sites and telling prospective deserters they will be “nailed to the pillar of historical shame,” a report said Thursday.

Sun Chunlan — a government official attempting to control the outbreak in Wuhan — ordered officials to go to each home and take temperatures of every resident in Wuhan, The New York Times reported.

Sun also ordered investigators to interview anyone who has been in close contact with an infected person, according to the report.

“Set up a 24-hour duty system. During these wartime conditions, there must be no deserters, or they will be nailed to the pillar of historical shame forever,” Sun said, according to the Times.

Officials in the city responded to the order by setting up mass quarantine shelters, which are designed to house patients with light symptoms of the virus.

The rapidly spreading virus has now killed more than 560 people and infected more than 28,000.
