*Prices as of 6:50am CST.

Corn: May corn futures slid $0.02 lower this morning to $3.7975. July futures were down $0.025 to $3.815 as continued coronavirus concerns plague global markets.

Cash corn prices were mostly unchanged around the Corn Belt yesterday. A Chicago-area corn processor weakened basis $0.01 to $0.12 ahead of May futures. Light sales earlier in the week were offset by slow sales yesterday as May futures prices shed $0.032.

New export sales of corn were 3.5 million bushels lower than the previous week, according to yesterday’s weekly export sales report. The total of 38.6 million bushels for the week ending February 27 fell on the lower end of the expected range of 27.6-51.2 million bushels. Poor corn quality out of the Pacific Northwest has deterred international buyers from booking new sales in recent weeks. Despite anemic sales, exported corn rose 1.6 million bushels from the previous week to 34.8 million bushels, offering a small glimmer of hope for corn demand in the short run.

The CFTC’s Commitment of Traders report is set to be released this afternoon. Managed money accounts may add more bullish sentiments to their position on corn following a rally in May futures prices that featured as much as a $0.1325 increase during the week ending March 3. Speculative traders held onto a net short position last week and despite the rally this week, weak export demand will continue to prevent speculators from moving to a long position in the near future.

South Korea purchased 2.6 million bushels of corn from South America overnight for June shipment. The shipment, believed to be provided by trading house Bunge, was priced at $5.28/bushel c&f.

Soybeans: May futures prices faltered again this morning on coronavirus fears, down $0.06to $8.91. The price decline came in spite of the fact China granted tariff exemptions of a year to crushers looking to purchase U.S. soybeans, a move that reassured markets China is willing to make good on their Phase 1 promises. May soybean oil prices retreated $0.47 to $28.92 while May soybean meal futures added $0.2 to $304.1.

Cash soybean bids weakened $0.10 but remained at a $0.15 premium over May futures prices at a Lafayette, Indiana processor. Spot basis bids were steady elsewhere in the Midwest yesterday. The futures rally early in the week ran out of steam yesterday as May futures closed the day $0.10 lower, discouraging new sales.

Despite yesterday’s weekly export sales report finding a slight uptick of 65,320 bushels in new soybean export sales from the previous week to 13.2 million bushels, new sales fell significantly short of the projected trade range of 18.4-37.7 million bushels.

Farm Futures’ Ben Potter notes that Chinese sales remain glaringly absent from the weekly export report due in large part to reduced demand from the coronavirus in his analysis of the report, though Mexico accounted for the lion’s share of new sales. Soybean exports in yesterday’s report rose 3.6 million bushels to 25.6 million bushels but remained 22% lower than the prior four-week average.

The CFTC releases their weekly Commitment of Traders report today. A rally in May futures prices through the week ending March 3 will likely send speculators’ sentiments more bullish on soybeans, though likely not enough to reverse their short position on the oilseed.

Soybean farmers in Argentina are planning a four-day selling ban against the government’s new tax increases on exports of agricultural products, specifically soybeans. Soy crushing companies have warned the tax increase from 30% to 33% threatens to reduce the competitiveness of Argentine soybean farmers on the international market as the government attempts to raise funds to pay back what it deems “unsustainable” debt. Argentina is the largest exporter of soybean meal in the world. To add insult to injury, a dry spell is threatening to take a toll on Argentine soybean yields ahead of harvest.

Wheat:

The ICE Dollar Index traded 0.88% lower this morning and stronger than expected export results yesterday lifted Minneapolis futures prices up half a cent this morning. However, continued coronavirus fears weighed on Chicago and Kansas City wheat prices.

Spot basis bids on soft red winter wheat at a Chicago elevator weakened $0.15 to $0.30 over May futures prices. Cash prices for hard red winter wheat in the Plains held steady yesterday. Grain movement continued to be slow due to depressed cash offerings.

Protein premiums on hard red winter cash wheat delivered to or through Kansas City by rail were unchanged from Tuesday, as shown below:

Wheat exports got a boost in yesterday’s weekly export sales report. New export sales rose 4.6 million bushes from the previous week to 21.5 million bushels. Trade estimates ranged between 13.8-24.8 million bushels of wheat. Falling futures prices through the week ending February 27 piqued international interest in U.S. wheat as yesterday’s figure landed on the higher end of the trade range. Wheat exports rose 8.8 million bushels for the week to land at 23.8 million bushels, up 36% from the prior four-week average.

Today’s Commitment of Traders report will likely feature speculative funds remaining long on soft red winter wheat though traders may add a significant amount of short positions as May futures tumbled from the report week of February 26 through March 3. Similar bearish sentiments are expected for hard red winter wheat. Though after ending the previous week at a long position of only 8,260 contracts, speculators could turn into net sellers of Kansas City wheat this week.

The French wheat crop remains stable, with 64% of the crop in good to excellent condition. While ratings were unchanged from last year, this week’s rating was below the 86% good to excellent score of the same period a year ago. A wetter than usual planting season set this year’s crop back in comparison to the previous year. France is the number four wheat producer in the world.

Weather: Clear weather and moderate temperatures will be enjoyed by most areas of the Corn Belt through the weekend. A precipitation system containing a wintry mix will move out of areas of the far Eastern Corn Belt late this evening, according to NOAA's short-range forecast, paving the way for a calm weekend throughout the Midwest.

Financials: February jobs data is expected to be released this morning. Traders are expecting strong results, though since the report data was compiled prior to the economic fallout of coronavirus, any strength in jobs growth will likely not be enough to offset yesterday’s losses that continued into the night.

E-mini Dow futures lost 617 points or 2.37% to 25,452 points in overnight trading as investors continued to liquidate equities into safer assets due to coronavirus fears. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note continued to fall at a record-breaking pace as it sank to 0.748% prior to the market opening. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts earlier this week are losing their magic as White House officials do not intend to implement any stimulus policies to slow the economic bleeding.

Daylight savings time (DST) begins this Sunday as we spring an hour ahead into sunnier evenings. But we pay a steep price for that extra daylight. Increased car crashes – as high as an 8% jump the Monday following DST – rack up a social cost of $275 million a year. Acute cardiovascular episodes increase 24% the Monday after DST begins. So, make sure to take care of yourself and your family this weekend to mitigate the effects of the precious hour of sleep that will be lost. On the bright side, one study found a 7% decrease in robberies after the start of DST, a $59 million savings to U.S. society.
