SINGAPORE — Four additional cases of the novel coronavirus, including a six-month-old Singaporean baby boy, were confirmed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Wednesday (5 February), bringing the tally to 28.

This makes Singapore the country with the second-highest number of confirmed cases outside mainland China, behind Japan.

Three of the new cases, all of whom have not recently travelled to China, are linked to the country’s first batch of local transmission announced on Tuesday, while the fourth one is a Chinese tourist from Wuhan. All four cases are stable.

The baby – currently the youngest confirmed case here – and a 45-year-old Singaporean man is, respectively, the son and husband of a 28-year-old female Singapore permanent resident who works at Yong Thai Heng, a health products shop in Cavan Road popular with Chinese tourists.

She and her colleague, a 48-year-old Singaporean woman, were among four cases of local transmission announced by the MOH on Tuesday, including a 32-year-old Singaporean tour guide who brought Chinese tourist groups to the shop.

The trio had close contact with a group of travellers from Guangxi, of whom at least two have been confirmed to be infected with the virus, also known as 2019-nCoV. The fourth case confirmed on Tuesday was the 28-year-old woman's Indonesian foreign domestic maid.

Her husband tested positive for the virus on Wednesday at about 2pm and is currently warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).

The infant tested positive for the virus on the same day and is currently warded in an isolation room at the KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital.

The MOH said the six-month-old baby was cared for at home and was not in any infant care facility before he was hospitalised.

Tour guide’s family member infected

A 40-year-old Singaporean man, the husband of the tour guide, was also among the new cases announced on Wednesday.

He reported that he developed a fever on 24 January and visited Hougang Polyclinic with his wife last Thursday. She also visited a supermarket near their home at Buangkok Green.

Subsequently, the man visited the NCID on Monday, where he was immediately isolated and is currently warded. He tested positive for the virus the next day at around 8pm.

Prior to his hospital admission, the Singaporean stayed at his home and worked at Diamond Industries Jewellery Company at Harbour Drive which was visited by the same tour group from Guangxi.

He indicated that he had visited Pasir Panjang Hawker Centre and had travelled by public transport.

“The risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low,” said the ministry.

Daughter of previous case infected

The fourth case confirmed on Wednesday is a 42-year-old female Chinese national who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on 21 January, and the daughter of a previously confirmed case.

As she was showed symptoms, she was conveyed by ambulance to the NCID on the same day as her 73-year-old mother, also a Chinese national, and immediately isolated.

She later tested positive for the virus on Tuesday at about 8pm and is currently warded in an isolation room at the NCID.

The health ministry reiterated that there is no evidence of widespread community transmission of the novel coronavirus in Singapore. It also called on Singaporeans to defer all travel to Hubei province, home to Wuhan, and all non-essential travel to mainland China.
