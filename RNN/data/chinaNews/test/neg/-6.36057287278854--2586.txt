Anti-government protesters in Iraq have set fires and closed streets near Baghdad’s Tahrir Square during a demonstration against the Iranian missile strike that targeted two military bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops.

The Iranian attack was in retaliation for a U.S. drone strike that killed top Revolutionary Guard commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani last week near the Baghdad airport.

About 100 protesters took part in Wednesday morning’s demonstration near Tahrir, the epicenter of Iraq’s protest movement. The protesters carrying Iraqi flags shouted “Iran out, out!” before they were dispersed by security forces.

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has condemned the Iranian missile strike against bases hosting coalition forces in Iraq and urged Iran to refrain from further military action.

The Ministry of Defense said Wednesday there were no British casualties in the attack launched in retaliation for the U.S. drone strike that killed Iran's top Revolutionary Guard commander, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, in Baghdad last week.

U.S. officials have said there are no immediate reports of U.S. casualties.

"We urge Iran not to repeat these reckless and dangerous attacks, and instead to pursue urgent de-escalation,'' Raab said. “A war in the Middle East would only benefit Daesh (the Islamic State group) and other terrorist groups.” Coalition forces are in Iraq to train local forces to fight the extremists.

12:05 p.m.

He spoke after the Iranian missile strike at bases in Iraq used by U.S. forces but did not address it directly.

Geng also accused the U.S. of abusing the rights of people in the region through its military actions.

None of the German troops stationed in Iraq were injured.

It joined several European countries in saying their troops in Iraq were not harmed, including France, Poland, Denmark and Finland.

At least one missile from the Iranian strike against U.S. forces in Iraq on Wednesday landed in a field near Bardarash, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Irbil, the capital of Iraq's self-governing Kurdish region.

An Iraqi Kurdish channel, Rudaw TV, showed video of police inspecting the impact site and removing shrapnel.

No casualties were reported but residents said the earth shook upon impact, and one man was seen cleaning up slight damage to his house on a nearby street.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in an address to the nation says "we slapped them (Americans) on the face last night" with a missile strike “but military action is not enough.”

He spoke hours after the strike at military bases in Iraq used by U.S. forces. The strike was in retaliation for the U.S. killing of Iran's top military commander in Baghdad.

Khamenei added that the “corrupt presence of the U.S. in the region should come to an end," saying it has caused war, division, and destruction.

Iran's supreme leader also invoked the virtues of the slain commander, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, saying he was a "great, brave warrior" and “dear friend to us.” Huge crowds in Iran have mourned Soleimani's death last week in the airstrike in Baghdad.

A Russian lawmaker warns that a conflict between the U.S. and Iran might lead to a nuclear war.

The comments by Vladimir Dzhabarov, lawmaker with Russia’s upper house of parliament, on Wednesday followed an Iranian missile strike at military bases in Iraq used by U.S. forces. The strike was in retaliation for the U.S. killing Iran's top military commander in Baghdad.

“Reciprocal strikes by the U.S. and Iran may lead to an all-out war in the region,” Dzhabarov said. “If Washington sees that it can’t achieve its goals, there’s a danger of a nuclear war.”

The Russian lawmaker said the U.N. Security Council should get involved to prevent further escalation in the Middle East.

Iraq's military says it had no troop casualties in the Iranian strike, and President Donald Trump tweeted that“All is well!” as casualty and damage assessments are ongoing.

10:30 a.m.

The Iraqi military says there are no casualties among its troops as a result of an Iranian missile strike at bases in Iraq used by U.S. forces.

He spoke after an Iranian missile strike at military bases in Iraq used by U.S. forces. The strike was in retaliation for the U.S. killing an Iranian general in Baghdad.

He said even in past times of war, the flow of oil has been maintained.

“So let’s not exaggerate what’s happening. There is no risk that we have seen to the Strait of Hormuz or the movement of oil yet,” Al-Mazrouei said, referring to the narrow waterway between the Arabian Peninsula and Iran through which 20% of the world’s oil passes through.

He spoke reporters in Abu Dhabi at the Gulf Intelligence’s UAE Energy Forum.

The Federal Aviation Administration is barring U.S. pilots and carriers from flying in areas of Iraqi, Iranian and some Persian Gulf airspace.

The agency is warning of the “potential for miscalculation or mis-identification" for civilian aircraft amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran. The emergency flight restrictions follow ballistic missile strikes Tuesday on two Iraqi bases that house U.S. troops.

Such restrictions are often precautionary in nature to prevent civilian aircraft from being confused for ones engaged in armed conflict. The FAA says the restrictions are being issued due to “heightened military activities and increased political tensions in the Middle East, which present an inadvertent risk to U.S. civil aviation operations.”
