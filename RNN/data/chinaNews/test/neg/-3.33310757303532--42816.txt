The latest cases come after the 7,000 passengers who were kept in lockdown onboard the Costa Smeralda were allowed to leave the boat

'There is no reason to create social alarm or panic.'

The latest cases come after the 7,000 passengers who were kept in lockdown onboard a cruise ship in the Italian city of Civitavecchia were allowed to leave the boat after receiving confirmation that two people onboard did not have the coronavirus.

The people travelling inside the Costa Smeralda ship had been kept on the ship since Thursday morning after a Chinese woman, 54, from Macau, who boarded the ship on January 25, came down with 'mild flu-like symptoms' the previous night.

The woman, who was placed in an isolation unit on the ship with her partner, tested negative for the virus, Italy's health ministry later confirmed.

Costa Smeralda, which is owned by the company Costa Crociere, offered to pay for food and hotels for some 1,140 people who had been due to disembark at the Civitavecchia port near Rome on Thursday.

The cases in Italy come as the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared an international public health emergency over the outbreak.

Following a meeting with an emergency committee in Geneva, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters: 'The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries.

'Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it.'

The coronavirus, which has infected nearly 10,000 people and killed 213, is known to spread easily through coughs and sneezes and close contact, and people may be contagious even if they feel well.
