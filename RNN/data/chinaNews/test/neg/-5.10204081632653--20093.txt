The Department of Health (DoH) on Thursday said there is no confirmed cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the country as it has yet to receive the results of a confirmatory test on a child suspected of carrying the virus.

“DoH is currently awaiting the results of the confirmatory test,” read a post from the agency’s Facebook page.

The post came out as reports that tests in Cebu on the Chinese boy believed infected with the coronavirus turned negative for the infection and may be discharged soon from a hospital.

The boy from Wuhan, where the 2019-nCoV originated, was quarantined after showing symptoms of the virus such as fever, cough and throat irritation upon his arrival in Cebu City.

For its part, Malacañang said Wednesday there is no recommendation yet to ban visitors from Wuhan, China from entering the Philippines.

“It has not reached an alarming level that we have to do some drastic measures like prohibiting people from entering, especially those suspected to having that kind of virus,” Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said in a Palace press briefing.

Panelo, nevertheless, assured the public that the Palace would take prompt action when concerned state agencies recommend the issuance of a travel ban on tourists from Wuhan where the 2019-nCoV outbreak started in December last year.

China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency reported that 571 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV had been reported throughout China, resulting in 17 deaths, all in Hubei province.

Overseas, the regions of Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, as well as in the United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea have confirmed one case each, with Thailand confirming three.

DoH Secretary Francisco Duque III has said there is no confirmed case yet of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines.

However, the Department of Health (DOH) is looking into a suspected case of the new coronavirus infection after a five-year-old Chinese boy from Wuhan showed signs of fever, cough, and throat irritation upon arrival in Cebu City.

DOH ‘on top of the situation’

Coronavirus is a “large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV,” according to a definition from the official website of the World Health Organization (WHO).

WHO also warned that coronavirus can be transmitted between animals and people.

Panelo said the government, through the DoH, has intensified its monitoring against the 2019-nCoV.

He expressed confidence that the DoH is “on top of the situation” to prevent the virus from entering the country.

“I talked with Secretary Francisco Duque and he said that we’re on top of the situation,” he said.

“Secretary Duque (said) wala raw (there is no reason to panic),” Panelo added. (PNA)

A total of 393 suspected 2019-nCoV cases have been reported, according to China’s National Health Commission (NHC).

The pneumonia situation had resulted in 17 deaths, all in central China’s Hubei Province. Those who died from the disease were reported to be between the ages 48 and 89, according to the commission.

It added that most of the patients who died had underlying health issues such as cirrhosis, diabetes, high blood pressure, and coronary heart disease.

A total of 5,897 close contacts have been traced, the commission said, adding that among them, 4,928 are under medical observation while 969 others have been discharged.

The NHC has been updating the prevention and control plan for pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus.

Based on the current knowledge, the incubation period of the virus, the interval between infection to onset of symptoms, can be as long as about 14 days, according to the second version of the prevention and control plan released Wednesday by the NHC.

Meanwhile, the general office of the NHC and the office of the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine jointly issued the third trial version of the diagnosis and treatment plan Thursday.

The updated plan covers the etiology characteristics of the virus, the clinical characteristics of the outbreak, related case definition and diagnosis, as well as discovery and reporting of cases. It also offers treatment plans including those with traditional Chinese medicine. (Xinhua)
