Top microbiologist Ho Pak-leung said that the coronavirus identified in Wuhan might be able to be spread between humans, or it might already have happened.

Ho explained that after the closure of Wuhan's Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, where the virus originated, there are still newly infected cases, and there are also patients that have not visited the seafood market.

Ho warned that there might be cases spreading into the city as the Lunar New Year holidays are right around the corner, while citizens of the Mainland move around the country to get back to their hometown during the holidays.

This came as a British study estimated that there might be over 1,700 infected cases in Wuhan, but Ho said that the figures contains uncertainty, but could be taken as a reference.
