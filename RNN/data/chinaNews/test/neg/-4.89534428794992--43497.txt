220 of the 324 Indians evacuated from the coronavirus-hit Chinese city of Wuhan were sent to the Army quarantine facility at Manesar on Saturday, while the remaining 104 were shifted to Indo-Tibetan Border Police-managed Chhawla Camp in the capital for medical observation, the Health Ministry said.

The 324 evacuees -- including 3 minors and 211 students -- had arrived in India on Saturday morning on Air India's Boeing 747 Jumbo aircraft. The passengers will be kept in isolation at the quarantine facilities for 14 days in the said locations.

All the evacuees had gone through the necessary screening at the Indira Gandhi International Airport upon arrival.

The second Air India special flight will depart to Wuhan on Saturday afternoon for the evacuation of Indians, carrier's spokesperson Dhananjay Kumar said.
