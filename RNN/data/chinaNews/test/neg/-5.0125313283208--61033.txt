These are satellite images from the deserts of Western China. Look closely, and you’ll see these huge complexes being built. From the sky, they sort of look like factories or even schools.

But look even closer: this line is one facility’s perimeter wall.

And these shadows? They’re cast by the watch towers along the wall.

This compound isn’t a school or a factory. It’s an internment camp. Inside these camps, the Chinese government is detaining, torturing, and re-educating as many as 1-1.5 million Uighurs — China’s mostly Muslim minority. China doesn’t want the world to know any of this. But the story of these camps is also the story of how we know about them — and China’s efforts to cover them up.

Uighurs mainly live in the Xinjiang province of northwestern China. That puts them closer to the capitals of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan than to Beijing. And Uighurs are also closer culturally to those Turkic groups than they are to the Han Chinese, China’s ethnic majority.

“ The Uighurs speak a Turkic language, their culture is different, they have particular styles of music, a whole rich history that is unique to them.” — Sigal Samuel, Atlantic

China has been concerned for decades about the possibility of Uighur separatism. Uighurs have actually had their own independent nation, two separate times in the last century. In 1933, they established the Islamic Republic of East Turkistan in the ancient Silk Road city of Kashgar. But it crumbled less than a year later when it was taken over by Chinese forces.

Then in 1944, the Soviet Union backed the creation of the East Turkestan Republic. But when China became Communist in 1949, the Soviet Union turned on East Turkestan, and helped China take it over again.

Part of why the Xinjiang region is so important to China is that it’s rich with energy resources. And as China’s economy grew, so did its need for energy. Today, Xinjiang accounts for nearly 40% of China’s coal reserves and over 20% of the country’s oil and gas. It also accounts for China’s potential for wind energy. China needs energy, it needs resources, it needs the geographical location on which Xinjiang sits. That’s where Uighurs are and that’s where they’re living — and so China wants to really have a solid sense of control over that area.

As far back as the 1950s, China saw an opportunity to dilute the influence of potentially rebellious Uighurs, and started encouraging the migration of Han Chinese into Xinjiang — and it worked. In 1945, Uighurs made up over 80% of the population compared to just 6% of Han Chinese. By 2008, Xinjiang was 46% Uighur compared to 39% Han Chinese.
