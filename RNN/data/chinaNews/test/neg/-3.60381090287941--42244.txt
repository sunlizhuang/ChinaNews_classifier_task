Sales of surgical masks have surged in Regina as the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak continues to spread worldwide.

“We’ve been completely sold out for over a week,” Yvonne Slobodian, owner of Jolly’s Medical Supplies, told the Leader-Post on Friday. “We have probably at least over 100 inquiries a day.”

Slobodian said the surge in sales started about 10 days ago, with people coming in because they’re getting ready to travel by plane or are somehow medically compromised and want extra protection against the virus.

The store has sold out of every type of surgical mask they carry and she says they have 150 boxes on backorder.

“They’re redirecting all of the N95 masks to acute care centres and so there’s a big shortage,” said Slobodian. “I contacted our suppliers yesterday and they have 21,000 cases on backorder.”

Jolly’s isn’t the only business having trouble keeping masks in stock.

Canadian Tire in Southland Mall got an order of 5,000 basic surgical masks in stock Monday and were already sold out as of Friday morning. An employee at the store said they get several calls a day inquiring about the masks.

Lowe’s in Harbour Landing is also sold out of the N95 masks. Both stores noticed an increase in sales about 10 days ago and have been ordering extra to try and keep up with the demand.

Home Hardware also noticed an increase and has ordered more masks than normal but still had some in stock as of Friday morning. Nobody was in a panic, according to an employee at the store.

Slobodian says anyone buying a mask should make sure it fits around the nose correctly and that people remember to wash their hands after removing the mask. But for now, residents will have to go elsewhere to get one.

“We’re not expecting to get any N95 masks coming into our store,” she said. “At the earliest, it’ll be next week.”

On Thursday, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency, although the number of cases outside China has remained relatively low at 98 in 18 countries. There have been no reported deaths outside China.

So far there have been four confirmed cases in Canada, one in B.C. and three in Ontario.

As of Wednesday, a total of five coronavirus tests had been ordered in Saskatchewan. One test came back negative and results for the four other tests were still pending. The province’s chief medical health officer Dr. Saqib Shahab said Saskatchewan Healthline (8-1-1) has been receiving calls frequently from travellers.

Those who recently travelled from China and are symptomatic are being assessed by public health officials and the appropriate testing and precautions have been put in place.

With no confirmed transmission outside of China, Shahab said Canadians have little to worry about.

The coronavirus outbreak started in Wuhan, China in late December/early January. The death toll in China has climbed to 213, while global cases have reached 2,800.

“We’re learning more and more as time goes on, but generally like all viral illnesses your risk of severe illness is more if you’re older or have underlying health conditions,” said Shahab.

Research has also shown that the more sick someone with 2019-nCoV is, the more infectious they are, similar to SARS, said Shahab. He reminded residents who have travelled to China recently and are symptomatic, to call 8-1-1 for assessment.

If a resident is deemed ill enough to require medical attention, they are asked to call ahead, whether that is the hospital or their family doctor, so they can follow the necessary isolation protocols and limit contact with other patients.
