New York (CNN Business) Cruise stocks fell Thursday amid revelations that 7,000 people are being held on a cruise in Italy after a passenger showed symptoms of the Wuhan coronavirus.

Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Carnival Corporation tumbled in morning trading in New York, at times sliding as much as 5%.

The drop came as two Italian media outlets reported a woman and her husband from Hong Kong were each being kept in solitary confinement in the hospital section of an unidentified Costa Cruises ship.
