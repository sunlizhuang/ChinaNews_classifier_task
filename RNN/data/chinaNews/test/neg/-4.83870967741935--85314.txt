What is coronavirus?

WHO quotes, coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).Some viruses are transmitted between humans and animals. For example, SARS was thought to have been transmitted to humans from civet cats while MERS spread to humans from a type of camel.There are many coronaviruses that circulate in animals not yet infected by humans. The name coronavirus derives from the Latin word corona which means crown or halo. The virus image is reminiscent of a solar corona, under an electron microscope.

Coronaviruses can spread when:

Coughing and sneezing without mouth covering, will release droplets into the air and spread the virus.

Touching or shaking hands with a person who has the virus will pass the virus to the next

Making any contact with a surface or object that has a virus & then touching your nose, eyes, or mouth.

On rare occasions, a coronavirus may spread through faeces.
