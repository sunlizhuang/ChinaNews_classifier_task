So far, the deadly virus, officially named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has killed 106 people in China and infected more than 4,500 across 15 countries.

In Australia, there are currently four confirmed cases in New South Wales, and one in Victoria.

Coronavirus in Australia Australia's first confirmed case of coronavirus is a Chinese national in his 50s who tested positive in Melbourne after arriving on a flight from Guangzhou on January 19. Three more cases were confirmed in NSW, with two people in isolation at Sydney's Westmead Hospital. A fifth person, from Sydney, tested positive to 'probable' coronavirus after initial swabs. It was later confirmed they had contracted the deadly virus. The patient was identified as a 21-year-old female student at UNSW who travelled from Wuhan to Sydney last Thursday, January 23. Australia has raised the travel alert level to 'do not travel' for the city of Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - and for the entire Hubei province. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says unless people have contact with someone who is unwell and has come from that part of China, there is no need for current concern.
