Why Wuhan couple with coronavirus were able to move around in HK

Health officials came under fire after it was learned that a couple from Wuhan, the capital of central China’s Hubei province where a deadly coronavirus outbreak originated, were able to move around in Hong Kong even after they had been told to seek medical treatment for their fever.

Officials from the Department of Health (DH) explained on Thursday that the mainland couple were told to see a doctor for their fever but they did not heed the advice, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reports.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) under the health department said both the 72-year-old man and his 73-year-old wife later tested positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), adding that it is investigating the two cases, which brought the total number confirmed infections in the city to 10.

According to the CHP, the couple arrived in Hong Kong from Wuhan on Cathay Dragon flight KA853 on Jan. 22. They stayed at the W Hotel in West Kowloon from that day until Tuesday and visited the Ritz-Carlton Hotel and Four Seasons Hotel afterwards.

It is understood that the Ritz-Carlton did not accept their request to stay. The couple later checked in at the Four Seasons Hotel, where they were sent several hours later by ambulance to Queen Mary Hospital on Tuesday and were admitted for isolation and treatment.

An employee at W Hotel told HKEJ that it notified the health department on Sunday that the couple had fever, but the DH only provided face masks to them without taking further action. The hotel then decided not to extend their stay.

Public concerns over the spread of the disease heightened after it was learned that the couple visited several malls and restaurants before being isolated.

In a press conference on Thursday, Dr. Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the CHP’s Communicable Disease Branch, said the authorities did receive a notice from the W Hotel and suggested it tell the couple to seek medical help.

Asked by media why the DH did not follow the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance and require the couple to be isolated or quarantined, Chuang explained that they did fit the reporting criteria for suspected cases because they had been diagnosed by a doctor, adding that the CHP does not follow up on any suspected cases reported by citizens.

Addressing concerns over possible contagion in the community, Chuang pointed out that health monitoring, whether in hospitals or at boundary control points, can only be conducted on a voluntary basis as the authorities will never force a person to see a doctor, noting that if similar cases occur in the future, the DH will still not take the initiative to interfere.

Chuang confirmed that the couple had been to several places before they were sent to hospital and at least six people had been identified as close contacts.

In related news, Undersecretary for Security Hinny Lam Shuk-yee told a special meeting held by the Legislative Council’s Panel on Health Services that about 1,300 visitors from Hubei province have left Hong Kong in the past few days and only 15 remained in the city’s hotels as of Wednesday evening.

In response to media inquiries about the feasibility of invoking the Emergency Regulations Ordinance to compel people suspected of having contracted the 2019-nCoV to get medical help, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said authorities intend to only advise them to do so for the time being, adding that a meeting was scheduled for Friday to discuss whether a change of the policy was needed.
