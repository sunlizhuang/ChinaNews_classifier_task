Shares of Hong Kong-listed restaurants tumbled on Monday, with Chinese hotpot chain operators such as Haidilao and Xiabuxiabu leading declines, as concerns over coronavirus blunted investor confidence.

Haidilao, which is listed in Hong Kong, dropped 4.84% by the market close on Monday â€” after plunging more than 7% earlier in the session. Another Chinese hotpot restaurant chain operator, Xiabuxiabu Catering Management, also plummeted 7.05%.

Other Hong Kong-listed restaurant operators also saw declines. Tsui Wah Holdings fell 2.44% while Cafe De Coral dropped 1.82% and Fairwood Holdings shed 0.73%.

Hotel operators saw losses too, with Far East Consortium sliding 2.09% and Langham Hospitality Invesments declining 1.96%.

The moves came after the South China Morning Post reported Sunday that nine members of the same Hong Kong family contracted the coronavirus after sharing a hotpot and barbecue meal at a restaurant called the Lento Party Room, which has no known connection to Haidilao.

Analysts who spoke to CNBC on Monday said the sharp downward movement in Haidilao's stock was likely related to those reports.

"In general, restaurant business during virus outbreak suffers," Hao Hong, head of research at BOCOM International, told CNBC in an email. "In the Guangdong province, 97% of restaurant businesses reported greater than 50% drop in revenue and 1/3 reported zero revenue."

"The situation is grave," he said. "Haidilao, despite being a strong company in the sector, is suffering along."
