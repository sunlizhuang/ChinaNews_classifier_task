A self-confessed Chinese intelligence operative seeking to defect to Australia has had his assets frozen by the NSW Supreme Court as a former business associate pursues him for $3 million.

The Supreme Court made urgent orders on January 24 temporarily freezing the Australian assets of Wang "William" Liqiang and his wife up to the value of $3.25 million.

The order was extended on Friday until further court order.

Sydney barrister Geoffrey Watson, SC, appearing pro bono on behalf of the couple, told the court on Friday that they did not contest the continuation of the order and were being kept in a "secure place" by a federal agency.
