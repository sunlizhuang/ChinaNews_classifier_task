A second Texan in two days has been found not to be suffering from the deadly Corona Virus, News Radio 1200 WOAI reports.

A Baylor University student who just returned from China and who fit all the symptoms for the disease had his samples come back negative from the Centers for Disease Control.

The student has been quarantined on the Baylor campus while the testing was underway.

This makes the second potential Corona Virus patient in Texas not to have the disease, and there are no no confirmed cases of the disease anywhere in the state. A student at Texas A&M who had also traveled to Hind tested negative on Sunday, which has killed dozens in China.

“This is very good news, and we are deeply grateful to our local and University health care providers and officials and the Waco-McLennan County Public Health District for their approach to this case, their proactive guidance and expertise and the compassionate care extended to our student while we awaited the CDC results,” said Sharon W. Stern, M.D., medical director for Baylor University Health Services.
