Deny L. King in on trial, accused of aggravated murder.

CANTON Jurors will return Wednesday morning to decide the trial fate of a man accused of murdering the manager of Brick City Lounge.

Deliberations started Tuesday afternoon following the testimony of Deny L. King, who is charged with aggravated murder in the June 27 shooting death of Jason Calhoun at the bar in Canton Township.

Calhoun managed Brick City.

The defendant said he had no other choice but to kill the man because he had feared for the safety of a friend whom he thought was still inside the bar following a fight.

The 26-year-old King said he had gone to Brick City with two other men that night to get out of the house and drink beer.

A fight soon broke out on the bar’s patio and moved inside. Multiple people were involved, including King and his friend, Milan Carr, according to testimony.

King then left the bar and returned twice within a short time span. On the third trip back, he said he returned with a firearm because he had heard gunshots in the parking lot that he believed were fired at him.

Moments later, he testified, someone made what he considered to be a verbal threat aimed at Carr, whom King thought was still in the bar.

Carr, however, testified Monday that he had left Brick City before gunshots rang out.

King testified that Calhoun told him his friend wasn’t in the bar, and wouldn’t let him inside to look for him.

"And (when Calhoun) dropped his hand, that’s when I shot him."

Defendant testifies

Under cross-examination, King told Stark County Assistant Prosecutor Kristen Mlinar that King was reaching for a weapon.

Mlinar, however, said the defendant left out that detail when questioned by his attorney Patrick Summers.

"Are you making this up as you go?," Mlinar said.

Mlinar said King wouldn’t have known Calhoun was armed because the gun was only discovered later by sheriff’s deputies when they pulled up his shirt while performing first aid.

No video evidence showed Calhoun displaying or firing his gun, the assistant prosecutor said.

Closing arguments

King is charged with aggravated murder but jurors have the option of finding him guilty of murder, which lacks the element of prior calculation and design and can be an instantaneous act.

A felonious assault charge stems from a second man at the bar who was struck by a bullet fired from King’s gun.

During closing arguments, Mlinar and Summers debated whether King justifiably killed Calhoun in the defense of another (Carr).

According to testimony, the bar was cleared out following the fight.

Mlinar said the argument fails legally because the defendant’s friend wasn’t even inside Brick City.

"When he doesn’t get his way, (King) kills Jason Calhoun and flees the state," she said. "Those facts you can see for yourself — that is what happened."

"You can’t walk to your vehicle and grab a gun and come back," the assistant prosecutor said. "Now you’re acting with some (purpose)."

Summers countered that Calhoun’s death was a tragedy but that the defendant reasonably thought his friend might get killed or injured inside the bar.

The defense attorney cited the earlier fight. King testified that he had been struck in the head with a pool cue. A day earlier, Carr testified he was also injured in the brawl.

Summers also said the defendant thought he had been shot at in the parking lot before he returned to the front door a final time.

"Just as you have a right to defend yourself you have a right to defend someone else," the attorney said.

"No one should lose their life like that ... but if you were in the shoes he was in that night, would you have just walked away to leave your friend (in danger)?," Summers said. "Is that reasonable?"
