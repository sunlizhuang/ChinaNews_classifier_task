The news media became the latest focus of the escalating tensions between the US and China on Wednesday after Beijing expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters over a commentary it deemed racist.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a news conference that China had raised repeated objections to the US newspaper over the opinion piece headlined “China is the real sick man of Asia” and felt “regret” that the Journal had not offered a public apology.

The decision to revoke the reporting credentials was announced hours after the US declared that five Chinese media outlets were “foreign missions”, saying they were effectively under government control. Geng said in the same brieifing that Beijing “reserved the right to respond” to this move.

The Wall Street Journal said the journalists — deputy Beijing bureau chief Josh Chin and Chao Deng, both US nationals, and Philip Wen, an Australian — had been given five days to leave the country.

All three had previously written about Xinjiang, where China has been accused of detaining up to a million Muslims in detention camps. Beijing says the camps are designed to combat extremism.

In August, China refused to renew the press card of Chun Han Wong, a Singaporean Wall Street Journal reporter based in Beijing.

The previous month, Chun co-wrote a story with Wen about an investigation by Australian intelligence and law enforcement into Ming Chai, a cousin of President Xi Jinping.

“The Chinese side handles affairs related to foreign journalists in accordance with laws and regulations,” Geng said. “The Chinese people do not welcome those media that use racially discriminatory language and maliciously slander and attack China.”

The opinion piece, written by Walter Russell Mead, a professor at Bard College in New York, said the Covid-19 crisis was a reminder that China’s power remained brittle.

“A deadlier virus or a financial-market contagion could transform China’s economic and political outlook at any time,” he wrote.

The headline of the commentary triggered widespread condemnation among Chinese internet users, saying the term “sick man of Asia” was derogatory and stereotyped Chinese people as disease-ridden and unclean.

Although the phrase originated in the mid-19th century, when the ailing Ottoman Empire was described as the “sick man of Europe” – and was later applied to Britain’s post-imperial malaise – it has humiliating echoes of the late 19th and early 20th century in China.

In that era it was forced to sign a series of unequal treaties with imperial powers and was first described as the “sick man of East Asia”.

The phrase is regarded as mocking the Chinese for being weak, and appears in the 1972 Bruce Lee film Fists of Fury, where his character is applauded for smashing a sign carrying the phrase in Japan.

Condemning the journalists’ expulsion on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that “mature, responsible countries understand that a free press reports facts and expresses opinions.”

“The correct response is to present counter arguments, not restrict speech,” said Washington’s top diplomat, whose department recently barred a National Public Radio reporter from Pompeo’s trip to Europe after Pompeo objected to being asked about Ukraine during an interview by another NPR reporter.

The US government hopes the Chinese people will “enjoy the same access to accurate information and freedom of speech that Americans enjoy”, Pompeo’s statement said.

The expulsions are a sign that media organisations are becoming caught up in the escalating US-China rivalry.

Lu Xiang, a research fellow on US-China issues with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, said that relations between the two faced unprecedented complexity and uncertainty.
