One new book has everyone talking about immigration stories and who gets to tell them. Recently, author Jeanine Cummins received a seven-figure advance for her upcoming novel, American Dirt, which tells the story of a Mexican mother forced to flee Acapulco with her young son when her husband lands in the sights of a cartel kingpin.

Critics have taken issue, not only with Cummins' problematic portrayals of Mexico and Mexicans, but also with the author's sudden identification with her Puerto Rican heritage. Cummins, who identified as white as recently as 2015, has rebranded as a Latinx author in promoting American Dirt — a book that Mexican-American author David Bowles called "harmful, appropriating, inaccurate, trauma-porn melodrama."

Additional criticism has pointed out the tone-deaf celebration of a barbed-wire aesthetic in promotional materials for American Dirt. Fashioned to resemble the book's cover, designs for the centerpieces at Cummins' book launch and the author's own manicure featured barbed wire — turning, in journalist Aura Bogado's words, a "symbol of oppression [into] a fashion statement."

The controversy surrounding American Dirt isn't likely to die down anytime soon. Until it does, here are 18 new books about borders and immigration you should read this year:
