There is absolutely no evidence the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, is circulating in Chatham-Kent, the local medical officer of health said during the latest board of health meeting.

Dr. David Colby said no tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, have been ordered in Chatham-Kent and no new cases of the disease are being investigated in Ontario.

“If you hear about coronavirus being found in respiratory outbreaks in some of our institutions here, it’s not this coronavirus,” he said Wednesday. “It’s the run-of-the-mill coronaviruses that cause common cold syndromes.”

The standard coronaviruses are usually “much milder than influenza,” he said.

According to Colby, there were 75,282 cases of the new coronavirus worldwide as of Wednesday morning, 74,282 cases of which were in China, Hong Kong and Macao. There have been 2,012 fatal cases documented, giving the virus a 2.5 per cent mortality rate, he said.

Colby said this data shows this coronavirus is already probably more contagious than SARS was in 2003, when about 8,000 cases were determined. He said the name of the virus now includes SARS because it is 70 per cent genetically identical to the notorious virus from the early 2000s.

However, he said the mortality rate is “much lower” than SARS, adding the current number may not tell the full story.

“If this is like other coronaviruses, there is probably a large number of people that are asymptomatic that are infected and there has been a documented shortage of test kits to run tests on people,” said Colby. “When there is a shortage of test kits, you know that only the sickest people are going to be tested.”

Colby noted there have been other coronavirus outbreaks that have had high mortality rates. In 1992, there was “a large outbreak of severe lower respiratory tract infection with a lot of deaths in Japan” due to coronavirus, he said.

“Everybody just kind of forgot about that and it just kind of went away, and this is just history repeating again,” he said.

The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which originated in 2012, has an “extremely high” mortality rate of 34.5 per cent, he said.

Colby said 82 per cent of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience mild symptoms, and there may be more people who are not showing symptoms. About 15 per cent do get severely ill while three per cent become critically ill, he said.

For those who are hospitalized with the virus, 98.6 per cent have a fever and the majority have fatigue and dry cough. Some have shortness of breath and muscle aches.

“And really, that is not distinctive in any way,” said Colby. “When you get a rhinovirus cold, you get much of the same presentation.”

The virus is transmitted through close contact, said Colby, which has affected family members and health-care workers. There is no evidence of airborne transmission, he said.

So far, the “lag time” between contracting the virus and showing symptoms has been between 11 and 14 days, which Colby said is “very unusual.” The official incubation period, when it is determined, could be a fewer number of days, he said.

“This leaves us with a highly contagious, but not very lethal, virus that so far has been largely contained in China and cases that have come to other countries have been very well contained,” he said. “There is no evidence that it is circulating in our community and anywhere in Canada, certainly not in Chatham-Kent.”
