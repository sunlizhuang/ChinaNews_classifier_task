CPC Central Committee calls on Party members to lead virus struggle

China has full confidence and capability to win the battle against the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday.

Xi made the remark while meeting with Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

"The Chinese people right now are faced with a very serious battle. And for the Chinese government, this is something that we take very seriously, because in our view, nothing matters more than people's safety and health," Xi said.

Xi mentioned that on Saturday, the first day of the Lunar New Year, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee convened a special meeting on the outbreak of the disease.

"And that tells you how seriously the CPC is taking this issue and what a priority it is for us," Xi said, adding that the CPC has also established a leading group to address the viral outbreak.

All the Chinese people and governments at all levels are fighting the very serious battle against the outbreak, Xi said. With strong resolve, a scientific approach and tailor-made policies, China will be able to prevail over this outbreak, he added.

Noting that the WHO has been playing a positive role in dealing with public health and safety issues, Xi said China looks forward to continuing positive cooperation with the organization to share information about the disease.

Tedros spoke highly of the measures taken by China on dealing with the disease, including sharing information internationally.

"And the other important element is the political commitment and your personal leadership which we have been following," Tedros told Xi.

China's political commitment and the country's serious measures will help stop the spread of the virus, he said, adding that the WHO appreciated Xi's very strong leadership and that China will ultimately win the battle against the disease.

The WHO firmly supports the measures taken by the Chinese government to fight against the outbreak, and it would like to enhance communication and cooperation with China, he said.

While meeting with State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Tuesday in Beijing, Tedros said China's powerful system and the effective measures it has taken to prevent and control the contagion are rarely seen in the world.

China set a record in identifying the pathogen in a short time following the outbreak of the contagious disease, he said, adding that the WHO stands ready to provide all necessary assistance to it in line with the country's needs.

Regarding some countries' intentions to withdraw their nationals from China, Tedros said the WHO does not support such moves. He said that under current circumstances, countries should stay calm and avoid overreacting.

The CPC Central Committee recently issued a notice requiring all Party organizations at different levels to take the lead in preventing and fighting the outbreak, Xinhua News Agency said on Tuesday.

On Monday, Xi issued an instruction requiring all Party organizations to unite the people in resolutely implementing the decisions of the CPC Central Committee in the battle against the novel coronavirus.

Xi stressed that keeping in mind people's interests is the highest priority in the current arduous battle of prevention and control of the contagion.

Xi required them to firm up their confidence, stay united and take scientific and targeted measures in epidemic prevention and control to allow the Party flag to "fly high at the frontline of the battleground".
