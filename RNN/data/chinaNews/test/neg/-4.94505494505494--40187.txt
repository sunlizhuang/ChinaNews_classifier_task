Thais to be evacuated from Wuhan on Saturday

Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwon.

A chartered plane will depart on Saturday morning to pick up Thais stranded in virus-hit Wuhan, Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwon said on Friday.

Gen Prawit said China had given permission for the plane to land at locked-down Wuhan.

Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul was handling arrangements for the evacuation, Gen Prawit said.

Dr Narong Aphikulvanich, deputy director-general of the Medical Services Department, said 64 Thai citizens were confirmed to be in Wuhan. A team of doctors specialising in respiratory infections and emergency medicine would be on the plane. .

They would have the necessary equipment to examine the evacuees as they board the plane and again after they arrive back in Thailand, Dr Narong said.

Those with symptoms of illness would be quarantined in hospital for at least 14 days. The others would be monitored at their homes for the same period for any signs of disease, he said.
