Poland has asked the European Commission for help in organising the evacuation of Polish citizens from the coronavirus-affected central Chinese city of Wuhan under the EU's Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM), the Foreign Ministry told PAP on Thursday.

France had earlier prompted the EC to launch the UCPM mechanism.

"Under the UCPM, all EU member states are cooperating to prepare transport for their citizens from Wuhan," PAP was told by the Foreign Ministry.

The EU will pay for transport by two planes which will repatriate EU citizens from Wuhan, EU Crisis Management Commissioner Janez Lenarcic was quoted as saying in the EC's news release.

More and more countries have been making the decision to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan.

The new coronavirus epidemic broke out in Wuhan in December. According to official statistics, 170 deaths were confirmed in China as of Thursday, with thousands more people having been infected. The government cut off Wuhan and its 11 million inhabitants from the rest of China. However, the virus's presence has already been confirmed in some twenty countries outside China.
