If you've lived in Beijing long enough, you've probably heard the rumors that “fensi noodles and seaweed are made of plastic,” “eating crab and persimmon at the same time will poison you,” and “pork blood and mu’er mushrooms can protect you from PM2.5.” In an attempt to quell some of this ignorance and scaremongering, The Beijing News recently listed a number of the most prevalent and pervasive fake rumors that have spread across China in recent years. Of course,it pays to be vigilant and conscious of what you're putting in your body but it also pays to know when people are feeding you lies.

Myth 6. Chlorine from boiling water will cause you cancer

Rumor: You must use boiled water to steam food, because otherwise “chlorine from non-boiled tap water will stick on the food and cause cancer.”

Fact: The content of chlorine in Beijing's tap water is low and does not exceed the recommended index. As a chemical, chlorine cannot give you cancer but it can aggravate respiratory conditions and high concentrations of chlorine can lead to many health complications. “Adding chlorine to tap water is the simplest and most efficient way to disinfect it,” says Liu Qingjun from Beijing Academy of Science and Technology, “during the boiling, the content of hydrochloric acid is far lower than it in human being’s stomach, so there’s no need to worry about it. Also after sampling tap water in Beijing throughout these years, none of the findings were beyond index.”

It should be known that boiling tap water will kill microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, or protozoans that can cause disease but it does not remove any metals or other contaminants that may be found in the water due to old pipes or leakages.

Myth 7. Eggs with paler eggshell have more nutrition

Rumor: A paler eggshell indicates that the egg has a higher nutritional value.

Fact: “The nutrition of an egg is connected with how the laying hen is raised, and the egg is fully formed before it is laid,” Zhu Yi, deputy professor at the College of Food Science at China Agricultural University explains, “in fact, it is eggs with red shells that contain more fat and have a higher calorific content than paler ones.”

Myth 8. Fensi noodles and seaweed are made of plastic

Rumor: This rumor came about after a man posted a video of himself burning rice noodles with a lighter, claiming that his rice noodles were inedible because they were made of plastic. There are similar videos involving seaweed, claiming that some seaweed is made of black plastic.

Fact: The Beijing News states that there’s no seaweed made of plastic in the Chinese market. Also, the major ingredients of fensi are starch and water, and starch is a flammable carbohydrate and just because something is flammable doesn’t make it inedible or fake.

Myth 9. Fruit enzyme extract can help you to detox

Rumor: Fruit enzyme extracts, usually sold in powder or liquid form, can break down fat and help you to lose weight. The enzymes can also help purify your blood, improve your general health, and prevent hair loss.

Fact: Enzymes are a kind of protein, which when consumed remain inactivate in the stomach and do not aid weight loss. However, if the enzymes are contaminated by specific types of pathogenic bacteria they can make the user sick and cause diarrhea.

Myth 10. If a cut potato doesn’t turn into black, it is a genetically modified potato

Rumor: If you cut a potato open and it doesn’t turn black after a while through oxidation then it is a genetically modified potato.

Fact: There are no genetically modified potatoes planted in China, and even if there were, whether a potato turns black or not is in no way related to its genetic makeup. “When a potato turns black is actually called browning, which is due to the polyphenol [in the potato] being oxidized,” says Huang Dafang from Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, “also the variety of potatoes that don’t undergo browning were cultivated in 1995, and were modified but not in order to prevent browning. They are also barely in existence anymore. Genetically modified food is not nearly as scary as the rumors would have you believe.”

If there's anything that these rumors prove it's that if you come across something that doesn't quite sound right, do the right thing and stay calm, don't be so scared, and use your brain.
