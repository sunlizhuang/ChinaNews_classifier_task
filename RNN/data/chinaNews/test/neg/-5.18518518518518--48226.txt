Events are quickly being overtaken by the coronavirus outbreak spreading from China. We estimate that the travel ban from China to New Zealand will dent quarterly GDP by 0.4% if it lasts two months. Before the travel ban was announced, the RBNZ was on track to shift to a neutral OCR outlook, but now the OCR outlook depends on how severe the coronavirus disruption turns out to be.

As the human toll of the coronavirus epidemic centred in China grows, so the economic impact on New Zealand intensifies. The SARS outbreak in 2003 was big news, but it had a vanishingly small impact on the New Zealand economy of around 0.1% of GDP. But that might not be the best guide to how severely this coronavirus will impact New Zealand. For a start, we simply do not know if the coronavirus will blow over like SARS and Swine Flu did, or whether it will turn into a more serious and long-lasting event. In any case, New Zealand's exports are more heavily concentrated toward the affected countries than they were during the SARS outbreak. In 2003 only 5% of our exports went to mainland China and 2% to Hong Kong; more broadly, 23% went to Asia ex-Japan. Today, 28% of our exports go to China alone, and 48% go to Asia ex-Japan.

The economic costs to New Zealand will arise not from the virus itself, but from the measures taken globally to try to contain it. Almost 60 million people are already effectively under lockdown in China, and people elsewhere in China are avoiding gathering in numbers. High-end New Zealand food exports destined for such gatherings have already been impacted. Crayfish was the first example, but we expect other seafood, fruit and meat exports will soon be seriously disrupted, as well as lesser disruptions to other exports stemming from the general slowing of economic activity in China.

The biggest impact on the New Zealand economy will stem from fewer people travelling between the two countries. Last week China banned all outbound travel booked through the Chinese Tourism Bureau. Over the weekend, New Zealand announced it would deny entry to all foreign nationals arriving from China. The ban is currently in force for two weeks, but we can only really see two possible outcomes â€“ either the travel ban lasts much longer, or the coronavirus enters New Zealand in force and the authorities give up on ideas of quarantine.
