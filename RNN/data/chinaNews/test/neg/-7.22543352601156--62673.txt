At least 61 people on board a cruise ship off Japan have tested positive for the new coronavirus. All aboard the ship are being quarantined for 14 days.

More than 200 passengers aboard the second Qantas evacuation flight from the coronavirus epicentre in China have landed in Darwin.

The Australian Border Force said the 266 evacuees included 77 children, 11 infants and one “less-than-able” 90-year-old man.

They were screened for signs of the virus two times while in the air and once at the airport in Darwin. All were “well” and healthy, the force said.

They had left the coronavirus epicentre Wuhan early on Sunday morning and were bussed to the disused Manigurr-Ma work camp 30km from Darwin.

Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said if anyone becomes unwell they will be taken immediately to quarantine in Darwin.

“They will go to the Darwin Hospital where they will be tested and if they are negative that is good and if they are positive they will be properly treated there,” Professor Murphy told reporters.

Evacuees were initially expected to be quarantined on Christmas Island, before a decision was made on Friday to bring them to the former Inpex workers’ accommodation.

Professor Murphy confirmed that a young Australian girl on Christmas Island has tested negative for the virus after developing an illness.

Meanwhile earlier today the New South Wales Department of Health said close to 1,500 arrivals from mainland China were assessed at Sydney International Airport on Saturday for the deadly coronavirus.

A total of 11,924 people have been screened for signs of the disease at the airport since February 2.

Of those assessed yesterday, five were sent for further testing, the Department of Health said in a statement released on Sunday.

While the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia remains static at 15, the virus’ death toll in China has rapidly jumped to 811, AP reported on Sunday.

The number of fatalities is now higher than the global number of deaths caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, which killed 774 people in 2002-2003.

All but one of the overall total of deaths have so far been in mainland China and Hong Kong.

While the World Health Organisation said on Saturday that the number of cases being reported daily in China is “stabilising”, scientific research released earlier this week predicted cases in China will double every six days, with some experts suggesting it will never be contained.

In NSW, three of the four cases confirmed thus far have been discharged from hospital.

They include a 53-year-old man, a 35-year-old man and a 21-year-old woman.

A 43-year-old male patient remains in hospital. No new patients were confirmed overnight.

On Friday, NSW Health warned the public to be aware of false and misleading rumours on social media and inaccurate reports regarding the spread of coronavirus across the state.

NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said there have been multiple incorrect and alarmist social media posts regarding the spread and severity of the disease, prompting the government to remind all residents to fact check.

Dr Chat said residents across the state need to be “aware of the facts” regarding the virus and to “take a moment to investigate unverified claims before they share them with others”.
