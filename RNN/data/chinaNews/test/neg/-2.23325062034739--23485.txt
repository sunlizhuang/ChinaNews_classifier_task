CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. (CLARKSVILLENOW)- The Center for Disease Control announced Friday, Jan. 24, that two cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the United States and more possible cases are being tested.

A Tennessee Tech student in Cookeville is being tested for possible infection of coronavirus, but results have not been confirmed. According to university officials, the student had mild symptoms and with his recent travel history, he is being tested for the virus, according to WKRN.

Dr. William Schaffner, professor of Preventive Medicine and Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said coronavirus is a family of viruses, that have symptoms similar to the flu.

“When we get the coronavirus, we usually get a cold,” Schaffner said. “We don’t know the source. It’s been shown it gives you symptoms like influenza that can turn into pneumonia.”

Coronavirus has been linked to China and those who’ve reported symptoms had traveled to China.

“It’s quite rare. We’ve had two instances in 20 years,” Schaffner said. “The first was SARS in 2002-03 and then the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) that was associated with camels. These are rare events and they are new. They are mysterious and occur in an exotic part of the world. Honestly, the flu…is more serious. Thousands are hospitalized and some die from the flu.”

Can it be transmitted from person-to-person and how? Schaffner said the CDC and health officials continue to investigate.

“The question is how frequently is it transmitted from person to person. We don’t know. It can be transmitted from person to person. We don’t’ know if it happens very readily. Apparently not.” Schaffner said. “We may change what we say as we get new info. At the moment it looks like you have to be sick before you can transmit this to another person.”

Schaffner said health officials are diligent in testing and offering public information.

“The response of our public health authority and everyone at the local hospital and infectious disease has been splendid,” Schaffner said. ” CDC has put out info. They are screening people who have come back from China.”

Currently, 63 specimens from 23 states are being tested, he said.

Schaffner said to prevent getting coronavirus to avoid travel to China, practice good hand hygiene. Call your healthcare provider if you have traveled to China or have had contact with someone who has and you develop symptoms.
