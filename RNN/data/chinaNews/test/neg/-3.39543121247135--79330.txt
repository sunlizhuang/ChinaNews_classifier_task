China reported its lowest number of new coronavirus cases on Thursday since January 23 when Wuhan – epicentre of the outbreak – went into lockdown, but a leading Chinese scientist has warned the disease may become an established illness like flu.

Wang Chen, president of the China Academy of Medical Science, said that despite the recent drop in the rate of new cases and fatalities on the mainland, the world should be prepared for the possibility that Covid-19 – the official name of the illness caused by the coronavirus – was here to stay.

Wang said the new coronavirus was different from the virus which caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which was both contagious and fatal. “This new coronavirus may become a long-term disease that coexists with humans, just like flu,” he told state broadcaster CCTV on Wednesday.

It was up to scientists, he said, to be prepared to study the coronavirus for the long term, and help to devise clinical strategies. “The key to containing the virus should be in scientific research,” he said.

There were 394 new cases reported in mainland China, and a further 114 deaths, as of midnight Wednesday.

So far, the disease has killed 2,118 people on the mainland, out of a total of 74,576 confirmed cases. China’s National Health Commission reported that 1,779 patients had recovered by Wednesday, bringing the total number of people who have recovered from the disease to 16,155.

It was also the 16th straight day of a fall in new infections outside Hubei province. New infections in Hubei have now dropped for seven consecutive days.

Beijing’s worst hospital infection toll rises

Thirty six people have now tested positive in Beijing’s worst hospital infection.

The cluster outbreak in the hospital in the capital’s Xicheng district was first made public on February 3 when the local authority announced five medical staff and four patients in the Coronary Care Unit had been infected.

By Wednesday the hospital said the number infected had risen to 36, eight of whom were medical staff, nine hospital employees and 19 patients or their family.

The building where the unit was located was sealed off on February 5, according to Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of Beijing Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. Patients remaining in the building must be monitored for two weeks.

Two more foreign residents infected

Two more foreigners in mainland China have contracted Covid-19 since last Monday, a central government official said.

There are 29 foreigners with confirmed cases of Covid-19 in China so far, 10 of whom are in Hubei province, according to Ding Xiangyang, deputy-secretary general of China’s state council, told a press conference in Wuhan on Thursday.

Of the 29 cases, 18 people have recovered and nine are receiving treatment in isolation, while a US and a Japan citizen have died.

Too early for optimism, despite fall in cases

Huang Yanzhong, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the tapering off of infections in mainland China outside the worst-affected province indicated the measures taken to stop the spread of the disease were working.

“The heavy-handed containment measures appear to be effective in stemming the further spread of the virus outside Hubei province,” Huang said.

But Chen Xi, assistant professor of health policy and economics at the Yale School of Public Health, said it may be too early to conclude that infections had peaked. Measures to close down community neighbourhoods in Wuhan had just been implemented, and their effectiveness remained to be seen, he said.

“While there has been a decline in the number of new confirmed cases and suspected cases, the increase in new cases continues to add to the demand for medical resources, although the discharge of recovered patients can help release some of these. In other words, the demand for medical resources remains tight and we are still at a critical stage in this battle against the disease.”

Chen said the number of daily suspected cases, while falling, remained high.

China can weather economic storm

China has sufficient financial tools to weather the economic storm caused by the coronavirus outbreak, its finance ministry said on Thursday, as a new package of help for companies was announced.
