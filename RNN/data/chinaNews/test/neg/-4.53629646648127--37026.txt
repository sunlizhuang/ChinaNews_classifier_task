India’s health ministry says it has detected its first case of the new coronavirus in the southern state of Kerala. A student who had been studying at Wuhan University tested positive for the virus.

The ministry says in a statement that the student has been kept in isolation and is being monitored at a hospital. It’s not clear when the student returned to India from China.

Passengers who have traveled to China recently are being screened for symptoms in at least 20 Indian airports. The health ministry says that isolation wards have been identified in different hospitals across the country in order to prepare for a potential outbreak.

The Indian government said yesterday that it is planning to operate two flights to evacuate Indians from Hubei in China and isolate them for 28 days in the Indian capital of New Delhi. The health ministry says that it was planning to airlift only those who don’t appear to have symptoms of the flu in order to minimize the risk of the infection spreading.

The Philippines has also confirmed its first case.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque said the 38-year-old Chinese woman had traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China, via Hong Kong on January 21. She sought treatment on January 25 due to a mild cough.

Duque said at a news conference the woman was confirmed positive from test results today and currently has no symptoms.-AP
