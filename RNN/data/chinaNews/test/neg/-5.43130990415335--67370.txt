HIGHLIGHTS:

A new wave of coronavirus test kits are missing 50 – 70 percent of infections due to very high rates of false positives.

Tens of thousands of these kits are being distributed to clinics across China for on-site testing, producing results in about five hours.

The test kits were rushed to market in a matter of weeks. Normally, they would require 2 – 3 years for scientific validation.

The kits may actually be worsening the pandemic by allowing infected people to escape identification.

The lower numbers produced by the test kits will be welcomed by the Chinese government which hopes to report falling numbers of infections, regardless of whether or not the numbers are true.

None of this may matter, since the communist Chinese government is fudging all the numbers anyway. The purpose of these kits seems to be creating medical theater, or creating the illusion that “real science” is hard at work to stop the pandemic.

The president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences has just blown the whistle on a wave of new, rushed coronavirus test kits that have been thrust into use across Asian, confirming they are only 30 to 50 percent accurate, reports SCMP.com. This means the test kits have a 50 – 70 percent false negative rate, missing infections by inaccurately reporting the samples as negative.

Adding to the problems with the new test kits, Li Yan, head of the diagnostic center at the People’s Hospital of Wuhan University, also explained that the multi-step process in preparing samples and testing them is prone to human error, causing further mistakes.

“A patient at Beijing’s China-Japan Friendship Hospital tested negative three times but was eventually confirmed to have the coronavirus infection after a fluid sample was taken from inside the lungs,” reports the SCMP. And we’re getting confirmed reports from many other sources that report people who initially tested negative but were later confirmed as positive for the coronavirus.

Clinics across China now shifting to these defective test kits which show lower numbers of infected people

The new test kits, produced by biotechnology companies with names like Sansure Biotech, Shanhai BioGerm and Shanghai Huirui Biotechnology, deliver results in a matter of hours rather than the typical three-day time period required for typical genetic testing at centralized laboratory facilities. This has caused front line health personnel to switch to these tests in order to get faster results.

However, if the tests are producing 50 – 70 percent false negatives, they may actually be contributing to a large number of missed cases, including “symptomless carriers” who go on to function as “super spreaders” who may infected dozens or hundreds of other people.

“The shortage of testing kits and their technical inaccuracies have exacerbated the situation, suggesting there could be far more infections than the official figures indicate,” reports the SCMP.

According to the Hubei Daily, the city of Wuhan currently has enough capacity to conduct 4,000 tests each day. However, given the inaccuracy of the tests, that could theoretically result in hundreds or even thousands of false negatives each day, allowing huge numbers of infected carriers to remain unidentified. This may, in fact, be the goal of the government, which has been seeking new ways to report fewer infections such as declaring symptomless carriers will no longer be reported as “infected.”
