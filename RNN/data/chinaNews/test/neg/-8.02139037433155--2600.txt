You know what the Europeans will do... pretend it never happened and go back to business as usual with Iran.

Germany is allied with Iran. Not America

might as well take advantage of this being UK related and add that a claim has now surfaced that UK special forces was ready to take the guy out in 2007 but Milliband nixed the mission. In hindsight, Milliband’s high tea diplomacy didn’t work out so well. Milliband contradicts the account. https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10672129/general-soleimani-thwarted-david-miliband/

That means, of course, that the EU is allied with Iran (because Germany is the dominant member of the EU).

Let’s not throw the UK into the rest of the sh.t Western Europe pile goldstate. they did the right thing and are doing the right thing Let’s try to keep up with the changes in countries. In case no one’s noticed, there’s been a big one in England. And I for one am thrilled.

The Iranian missile strike was a bluff, a fake. Now the world will say, See, they got it out of their system! The longer it takes for the real blow to land, the worse its gonna be. Dont rule out a nuke in the Strait of Hormuz.

The EU sided with Iran when the US pulled out of the faux Nuclear Arms agreement with Iran and the EU did not. The UN is nothing but a third world conglomerate of Islime countries who are taking money from the US and lining their own pockets. So don’t fool yourself to think either the EU or the UN will not side with Iran.

Talk is cheap. Question for the UK: Why are you still in INSTEX?

So dont fool yourself to think either the EU or the UN will not side with Iran. I don't think I implied or said anything to that effect. I said the EU would support Iran.

Yeh the Germans drive the EU train (wreck)

no shade thrown. I’m running through Reuters, most of the nations are checking in and confirming no casualties and recalling citizens but so far UK is the only one out with an affirmative condemnation of Iran. From the link in a post above, the Brits wanted the dead guy dead back in 2007 - which affirms that the dead guy needed to be just as dead 15 years ago, too. So far, Kurds want to be left out of it, Israel says it’s not their fight..yet. Spain has withdrawn troops while France is not issuing a recall. China urges restraint, Kuwait is pessimistic re: diplomacy. UAE, EU and a smattering of others have only offered brief statements of the need to de-escalate. Iran is issuing statements like they’re high on crack but its allies are quiet with the exception of Turkey, whose minister is flying to Iraq to talk turkey. And of course the Iran-agitators in Iraq are peacocking around, thinking they own Iraq now.

Dont rule out a nuke in the Strait of Hormuz. The only way Iran will get a nuke is if they succeed in fooling Israel into thinking they haven't got one once they've succeeded in developing one. If Iran comes to a point where they're *close* to developing one and Israel finds out the Israeli Air Force *will* take steps. Israel didn't develop a nuke just to pass the time...they developed it for just such a contingency.
