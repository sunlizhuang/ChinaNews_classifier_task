China once again dismisses US accusations on Pak-China Economic Corridor (CPEC).

US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Alice Wells, who is visiting Pakistan, has once again repeated the allegations regarding Pakistan-China Economic Corridor (C-PEC).

The Chinese Embassy in Pakistan has rejected the US allegations and said that according to State Bank of Pakistan data, Pakistan’s total foreign debt is $ 110 billion, Paris Club and IMF are the largest lending institutions to Pakistan.

According to a statement issued by the Chinese Embassy in Islamabad, the loan for C-PEC is $ 5 billion 80 million, which is 5.3 percent of the total debt. About 2%, the loan repayment is set to begin in 2021, the annual return will be $ 30 million.

He said that CPEC debt would never be a burden to Pakistan, China never forced to repay its debt to other countries, China would not make inappropriate demands for loan repayment on Pakistan.

According to the Chinese Embassy statement, the United States, in the past, before the accusation of Pakistan-China relations, saw what they did to Pakistan. Has Ellis Wells come to Pakistan with assistance, investment or trade?

He said that if the United States has the right idea of ​​the development and prosperity of Pakistan and the region, then it should bring cash and funds, cooperate on a mutual respect, fair and transparent basis so that the role of the global police station will never wake up. Impressive, the United States is still neglecting the facts about the CPEC, significant progress has been made over the past five years in the CPEC projects.

The embassy statement said that the CPEC projects improved the local transportation infrastructure and the power supply, the projects created 75,000 jobs and Pakistan’s rate increased, responding to the benefits of CPEC, Pakistani people should respond but not the US.

China’s statement says that the so-called debt story of the United States continues to evolve, their math is weak and bad intentions, ML One project has not been approved yet, the amount of the project will be adjusted according to Pakistan’s need.

It is to be noted that in November last year, US Assistant Deputy Foreign Minister Alice Wells alleged that China was forcing various countries to enter into agreements that were not in their favour.

He had said that Pakistan would have to ask tough questions, including the transparency of Pakistan-China Economic corridor CPEC project. Pakistan benefits are less than china from this project.

He added that the CPEC would only benefit Beijing, the US had offered Pakistan a better model.
