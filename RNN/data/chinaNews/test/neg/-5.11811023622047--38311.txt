The FBI has released a wanted poster for Yanqing Ye, the lieutenant for China’s military who is accused lying on her visa application and researching U.S. military websites for her country.

Ye, a Chinese national, is one of three people who were charged this week with hiding their ties to China. Ye, who is in China now, studied in the United States from October 2017 to April 2019 while attending Boston University.

She is accused of visa fraud, acting as an agent of a foreign government making false statements and conspiracy.

Ye, according to investigators, was a lieutenant of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), the armed forces of the People’s Republic of China and member of the Chinese Communist Party when she to the United States.

Authorities said she lied on her visa about her role in the PLA.

Ye was charged in federal indictments Tuesday, along Dr. Charles Lieber, chairman of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University, and Chinese national Zaosong Zheng, with aiding China and hiding their connections to the country.

Lieber is accused of working with a Chinese program aimed at encouraging scientists and researchers in the U.S. to share their expertise and research with Chinese government officials.

Zheng, a Chinese national, is accused of trying to smuggle vials of biological materials out of the country that authorities allege he stole from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
