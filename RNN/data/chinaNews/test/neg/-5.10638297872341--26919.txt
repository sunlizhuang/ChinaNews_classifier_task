A high-school student from China who was participating in the Yale Model United Nations conference on campus has been placed in isolation pending diagnosis of whether the youth has coronavirus, according to a statement by the director of Yale Health.

Dr. Paul Genecin said in the statement the student tested positive for influenza and that the test result suggests the student has influenza rather than 2019-nCoV, or coronavirus infection.

However, out of an abundance of caution, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “has asked that the student be tested for 2019-nCoV. We expect results in the middle of the week,” Genecin said in the statement.

The conference taking place from Thursday-Sunday at Yale, was canceled for Sunday.

The student exhibited cough and fever and was taken to Yale New Haven Hospital, and “does not exhibit severe symptoms,” so has been released from the hospital, but has been isolated pending the CDC’s diagnosis, Genecin said in the statement

“The student is in good condition and we will continue to monitor their progress,” the statement said.

Av Harris, a spokesman for the state state Department of Health, said the agency is aware of the high school student being tested for the virus, and confirmed no results have been received.

He said the agency is monitoring the case.

Genecin said in his statement that Dean of Yale College Marvin Chun, in consultation with health experts, requested that YMUN “cancel all activities that had been scheduled for Sunday.”

“YMUN organizers have reached out to advisors as well as those at Yale who had a part in the conference, to inform them” of the cancellation, the statement said. “This was to be the event’s closing day, and while Yale regrets that the participating MUN students will not be able to complete their conference’s program, we feel it to be in the best interest of those students and of the Yale community to take this precaution.”

Meanwhile, the state Department of Health and Wesleyan University reiterated Sunday that the state has no confirmed cases of novel coronavirus, after a student who recently traveled to Asia began showing symptoms of the disease.

“We have no confirmed cases of this particular viral strain in Connecticut,” said Harris. “We are keeping a close eye on the situation with the Wesleyan student but cannot comment on an individual case,” he said.

Wesleyan University is waiting on test results from the center for disease control after the student began exhibiting symptoms associated with the virus, said Lauren Rubenstein, a spokeswoman for the school.

On Sunday, officials in Orange County, Calif., confirmed a third case of the virus in the U.S., in a patient who traveled from Wuhan, China, the city where the outbreak started.

Two other cases, involving a woman from Chicago and a man in Washington state, have also been confirmed.

Rubenstein said Saturday the student exhibiting symptoms was isolated, and the university has reached out to people who were in contact with the student, but none of those students have exhibited symptoms, she said.

Patients infected with the virus typically suffer pneumonia-like symptoms including fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

Symptoms show up between two to 14 days after exposure to the virus, according to the CDC.

People who may have had contact with a person confirmed suspected of having the disease should closely monitor their health for 14 days, the agency said.

Besides fever and respiratory issues, “other early symptoms to watch for are chills, body aches, sore throat, headache, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and runny nose,” the CDC said.

Patients should inform the hospital they may have been exposed before they go in for treatment, the agency said.

Yale established a dedicated Yale Health hotline at 203-432-6604 or 866-924-YALE (866-924-9253) for concerned members of the Yale community and YMUN participants.
