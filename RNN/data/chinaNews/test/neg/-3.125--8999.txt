In addition to the unrest, volatile gold prices and trade tensions have also hurt the luxury retailer. SING TAO

Chow Tai Fook Jewellery (1929) said it plans to shut about 15 of its Hong Kong stores after their leases expire this year, in a sign that major retailers are starting to withdraw from the city's economy as anti-China protests continue.

In the first significant pullback by a luxury retailer after months of demonstrations that have driven tourists away, the world's second-most valuable jewelry chain said in an emailed statement yesterday that it will not renew the leases of a "mid-teens" number of stores in the year starting April.

More than 40 Hong Kong physical stories' leases will expire in the financial year 2021, or from April to March next year. The company will review the store performance and its store closures will mainly be located in tourist districts such as Causeway Bay, Mong Kok, and Tsim Sha Tsui, Chow Tai Fook's spokesperson said.

Chow Tai Fook is closing the stores because it expects "macro headwinds" to continue to have an impact in the next six to 12 months, it said. Besides the protests that have at times crippled the city, volatile gold prices and US-China trade tensions are also weighing on the company's outlook.

The company currently has 86 Chow Tai Fook retail outlets and five stores under other brands in Hong Kong.

The city's retail and tourism sector are poised for contraction after six months of depressed sales and a lackluster Christmas season.

With the number of tourists now at a record low, the first quarter of 2020 is likely to bring a reckoning for retailers: more than 5,600 retail jobs could be lost and thousands of stores shut down in the first half of 2020, according to a recent survey. Prominent restaurants and bars have also announced closure plans, while cosmetics retail chain Sa Sa International (0178) said it was likely to shutter 30 stores in Hong Kong this year.

The jeweler, controlled by the billionaire Cheng family, has seen same-store sales fall for three consecutive quarters in Hong Kong and Macau. It posted a 35 percent decline in same-store sales for the October-December quarter in Hong Kong and Macau market.

Chow Tai Fook is now focused on mainland China, with plans to add 600 new stores in the year ending March 31.

Shares of Chow Tai Fook rose 2.53 percent to HK$8.5 yesterday.
