"One further patient in England has tested positive for novel coronavirus (COVID-19), bringing the total number of cases in the United Kingdom to nine".

There have been more than 44,700 cases of the virus in China, with more than 1,100 deaths.

The U.K.'s most recent patient contracted the virus while in China and Professor Paul Cosford, director for Health Protection and medical director for Public Health England, told BBC they expect more cases involving worldwide travelers.

Public Health England confirmed on Wednesday it has traced and advised all close contacts of the two Global Positioning System, including about 12 patients.

Whereas the affected person has now been quarantined, Dr Thompson says the danger of the virus spreading relies on the girl's interactions previous to being positioned in isolation.

'As a result, given this case was in London, it might be expected that there is an increased risk posed by this case compared to the others we have seen'. The woman had flown into Heathrow from China at the weekend and called NHS 111 when she developed symptoms after landing.In an attempt to slow the spread of the virus, officials have now been ordered to trace all who she may have been in contact with since returning to the British capital, as well as the fellow passengers in her flight from China.Coronavirus first originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December past year and has killed more than 1,300 people in that country alone.

However, Robin Thompson, from Oxford University, told Sky News generally, the risk is higher in an area that's densely populated.

"That is exacerbated by the truth that London is a transport hub, and the underground might present a community to unfold the virus rapidly".

COVID-19 was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late December and has since spread to more than 20 other countries. Along with shutting down mass transit, officials cut off travel into and out of the city and advised people to avoid leaving their homes whenever possible.

And the World Health Organization's director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that the outbreak "could still go in any direction". The vast majority of infections and deaths have been on mainland China.

Professor Keith Willett, NHS strategic incident director, said Mr Walsh was discharged after two negative tests for coronavirus, 24 hours apart.
