Chinese news portal Ifeng.com, operated by Phoenix New Media, has been told to immediately stop violations concerning the release of information, according to the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC).

Illegal behaviors uncovered include spreading vulgar information via the news app of Phoenix New Media and publishing news information on Ifeng.com from sub-standard news sources, which has disturbed the order of the online community and imposed a negative impact on the network environment, said the authority.

The CAC has ordered the cyberspace watchdog of Beijing to seriously deal with the illegal behaviors of the news portal.

The local cyberspace regulator in charge has ordered Ifeng.com to conduct self-examination and correction, thoroughly clean up illegal online content and avoid the recurrence of these behaviors.
