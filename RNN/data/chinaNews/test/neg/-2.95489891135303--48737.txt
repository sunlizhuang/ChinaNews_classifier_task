Opponents of the Battery Plant Construction Took to the Central Square of Brest 3.02.2020, 15:21

The action ended with a procession along the streets of the city.

Opponents of the construction of the battery plant came to the square in the center of Brest. Such meetings have been held here every Sunday since 25 February 2018. According to human rights activist Uladzimir Velichkin, there were about 120 people on the square at 12:40, reported naviny.by.

Those present at the square discussed the information posted on the website of 1AK-Group, which includes IPower, that IPower was at the final stage to provide Dzmitry Bekalyuk and Uladzimir Maroz with project documentation for the battery plant to carry out Public Environmental Expert Review (PEER).

In particular, IPower explains this decision with the repeated refusal of Bekalyuk and Maroz to accept the project documentation. The reasons for refusal stipulated in the act of January 27 are unjustified and do not hinder the PEER.

"It's a nonsense," one of the leaders of the public campaign against the battery plant told BelaPAN and commented on the company report. - IPower must provide project documentation that meets the legislation, but it failed to do it. Apparently, IPower understands that we will not accept documents in this form and decided to complete the procedure of providing us with the project documentation".

It is noted that on January 27 Maroz and Bekalyuk spent almost five hours to review documents and revealed some new significant violations. In particular, the documents miss passports for the installed gas-handling equipment, industrial water treatment facilities. Experts cannot work without such passports when carrying out the PEER, believes Bekalyuk.

He pointed out that the project documentation specifies the output of up to 7.5 million batteries per year. Thus the report of an environmental impact assessment (EIA) has not changed. It remained the same. However, it was planned to produce up to 2 million batteries per year.

"We believe that this project documentation cannot be submitted to either public or state environmental impact assessment, said Bekalyuk. - We filed a complaint to the police on two flagrant facts. This is a falsification, as we believe, of the act of additional allocation of land to the plant for the construction of sewage. The second claim regards the certificate of the Chinese manufacturer of lead oxide equipment. It shows that the seal is pasted there. At that, this document specifies the calculation of lead emissions".

According to Bekalyuk, after the review of documents on January 27, they sent relevant appeals to the Ministry of Natural Resources and other government agencies.

"Earlier, we filed similar applications to the same structures as soon as we reviewed documents on January 21. We will decide what to do next as soon as we receive answers and the results of the inspection," said Bekalyuk.

During today's meeting on the square, Bekalyuk explained why it was wrong to accept the documents in the form presented by IPower. "If we'd received the documents, the countdown would have started as soon as the public examination began. Its tern is 30 days. The representatives of the company told us that missing documents would be provided upon request. However, given the submission of requests and answers to them, we would have fallen behind the one month provided for the public environmental impact assessment".

The participants of the meeting noted that the IPower was forced to carry out a public environmental impact assessment. However, it does not want to carry out it, so it provides documents that cannot be used for such an assessment.

After the meeting which lasted until about 12:40, the opponents of the plant construction walked along the central streets of Brest - Pushkinskaya and Sovetskaya to the cinema Belarus.
