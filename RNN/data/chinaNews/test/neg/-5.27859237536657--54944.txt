Meanwhile, two more evacuation flights carrying hundreds of Americans fleeing the novel coronavirus outbreak in China landed in California and Texas Friday, the AP reported. Like previous evacuees, they will be quarantined on military bases for 14 days.

"Our top priority is keeping the risk to the American public low, and we're working on all fronts to do that," Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters, according to CBS News.

The planes, carrying a total of about 300 passengers, landed at military bases in San Diego and San Antonio. In all, more than 800 Americans have been brought back on the chartered flights.

Another flight was expected to land Friday in Omaha.

The flights are the latest to be chartered by the U.S. State Department to ferry Americans out of Wuhan, the central China city at the epicenter of the global health crisis.

Dr. Jennifer McQuiston, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control's division of high consequence pathogens and pathology said the plane bound for Texas would stop at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, California, where evacuees from previous flights are already being quarantined. Anyone showing symptoms of the virus would remain at Travis, McQuiston said.

The Defense Department has approved plans to potentially quarantine U.S. travelers at 11 other military bases, according to the Washington Post.
