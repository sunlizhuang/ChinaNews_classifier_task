The health ministry says that Taiwanâ€™s hospitals are prepared to handle the possible spread of a new coronavirus that has arrived from China.

The virus, officially named 2019-nCoV, is responsible for an outbreak of pneumonia centered on the Chinese city of Wuhan. The virus has since spread through China and beyond. Over 400 cases have been confirmed and at least nine have died.
