Townsend thanked both the US and Kenyan forces for working together in bid to combat terrorism.

“US Africa Command works closely with the Kenyan Defense Force and shares a strong relationship. Kenya’s security contributions help contain the spread of al-Shabaab. Together, we truly understand the danger al-Shabaab poses and why it is important to pursue them,” said Townsend.

“Kenya’s extended contributions and commitment to the African Union Mission in Somalia not only reflect their dedication to their own defense, but to the collective defense of their neighbors as well," he added.

The general mocked China and Russia, two countries that have made inroads into Africa, for doing little in the fight against terrorism in the continent.

“China and Russia do very little to help Africans combat the brutal terrorist networks plaguing them,” he said.

“Conversely, US training, equipment and advice directly support our African partners, including Kenya and Somalia, in our common fight against terrorism. Our efforts are not just an investment in the security and stability of Africa but also provide enhanced security for the US homeland.”

The Lamu Manda Bay attack happened in the morning of Sunday, February 5, when the militants ambushed Camp Simba killing three Americans and injuring two others.

Six contractor-operated civilian aircraft were also damaged in the incident where it was reported that Kenyan soldiers hid in the grass.
