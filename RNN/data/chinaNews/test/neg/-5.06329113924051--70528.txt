NHS staff in Glasgow are to carry out home visits to test for possible cases of Coronavirus (COVID-19)

Staff from the public health team wearing protective suits will be taking samples from anyone experiencing symptoms who has visited any of the affected areas or been in contact with anyone who has recently returned.

The health board urged against alarm if residents see health workers wearing protective clothing, saying "no one is at risk."

Anyone who has visited China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korean, Hong Kong, Taiway, Singapore, Malaysia and Macau who is displaying symptoms within 14 days of returning is advised to phone their GP or NHS 24 on 111 immediately.

Dr Emilia Crighton, Deputy Director of Public Health, NHSGGC, said: “The risk of catching this illness in the UK is extremely low and only those returning from at risk areas, or people in contact with someone diagnosed with the illness are at risk.

“Our staff carrying out the testing will be wearing protective clothing as a precautionary measure and we would appreciate if the public show their support for our staff."
