A Manchester man has been released from quarantine after travelling to China amid fears of coronavirus.

Paul Walkinshaw, from Manchester, was on holiday in the city of Shiyan for Chinese New Year, when he was contacted by family members and told about the virus spreading.

He and other Brits were flown from Wuhan, where the outbreak first began, earlier this month and placed immediately in a quarantine facility at Kents Hill Park in Milton Keynes.

They have been there for the last two weeks, but today around 118 people have been released. Paul, 39, was among them.

He told ITV: "It feels fantastic to leave although it feels weird not having to wear a mask and gloves in public.

“The first 48 hours were hard when we were confined to our rooms, after that it was fine.”

He said staff had been friendly at Kents Hill Park and he thanked the local community for their support. He added that he was looking forward to sleeping in his own bed again.

All those released today have tested negative for coronavirus.

Across the world today, South Korea has been placed on the highest level of alert over the virus and Italy has now confirmed 79 cases.

Arrowe Park hospital on the Wirral is being used as another quarantine facility for those returning from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was held off the coast of Japan when a number of passengers tested positive for the virus.

Thirty Brits and two Irish nationals arrived back in the UK on Saturday night after being trapped on the ship for two weeks.

They all stayed at Arrowe Park last night and all tested negative for coronavirus before flying back to the UK.

Four Brits who were on the ship could not come home though, as they tested positive for the virus.

British nationals Sally and David Abel were diagnosed with pneumonia after contracting coronavirus on board.

They were celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary when the Diamond Princess was placed into quarantine.
