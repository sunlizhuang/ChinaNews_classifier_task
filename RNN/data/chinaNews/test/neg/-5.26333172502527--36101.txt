Queensland authorities have issued a health alert, confirming a passenger diagnosed with coronavirus travelled on a TigerAir flight.

The confirmed case of coronavirus travelled from Melbourne to the Gold Coast onboard TigerAir flight TT566 on January 27.

Health authorities have urged anyone who was on the flight who may have concerns to contact them on 13HEALTH.

In a statement provided to 7NEWS.com.au, the airline said it was working closely with Queensland Health and that passengers on board the affected flight would soon be contacted.

“Based on medical advice we have received, the risk of contracting coronavirus is low for passengers who travelled in this aircraft in subsequent days,” the statement read.

Precautionary measure

“However, we have taken the precautionary measure of cleaning this aircraft today.

“The safety of our passengers and our crew is always our number one priority and we will continue to work closely with Queensland Health on this matter.”

On Thursday, Qantas confirmed it will not be joining other major airlines in banning or scaling back flights to China amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Global carriers including British Airways have suspended all flights to mainland China, while others have dramatically scaled back services as the deadly virus continues to spread.

Qantas flights into and out of mainland China are so far unaffected as the airline continues discussions with the federal government to run an evacuation mission for Australians stranded in China’s virus-plagued Hubei province.

On Wednesday, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the airline was continuing to review its underperforming Sydney-Beijing route.

The airline had already announced plans to axe that service from March, but Joyce suggested that could happen sooner.

“We continue to review that, continue to review the loads, and whether we look to do that earlier, or keep it operating until that date,” Mr Joyce told reporters at the opening of a new pilot training school in Queensland.

He also said it was too early to say what impact the coronavirus outbreak might have on the carrier’s business.

He said the most similar comparison to coronavirus was the 2003 SARS epidemic in 2003, which cost the airline $55 million in lost earnings over a six to eight-month period and led it to cut some international capacity.

Virgin Australia

Virgin Australia does not operate flights to mainland China.

But it does operate a daily flight between Sydney and Hong Kong, and a daily flight between Melbourne and Hong Kong with the latter service scheduled to end on February 11 - a decision made before the outbreak.

In a statement on Thursday, Virgin Australia said it was closely following advice from Australian medical authorities and the World Health Organisation about precautions to minimise risks from the virus.

Meanwhile, Chinese families have taken to wearing large water bottles on their heads in a desperate bid to avoid contracting the new strain.

With face masks and medical supplies in demand, it’s understood those fearing the virus have gotten creative.

Photos taken at airports and train stations in China and Hong Kong show children and adults with their heads fully covered by the bottles.

Coronavirus explained

What is the coronavirus?

Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause a range of symptoms including a runny nose, cough, sore throat and fever.

Some are mild, such as the common cold, while others are more likely to lead to pneumonia.

The latest strain was discovered in the Chinese province of Wuhan.

How do you get coronavirus?

China says the virus is mutating and can be transmitted through human contact.

It’s primarily spread through a sick person coughing or sneezing on someone but a person could also become infected through contact with the virus particles on a surface, NSW Health warns.

What are coronavirus symptoms?

Symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Most of those affected are older people and those with underlying health conditions.

How dangerous is the coronavirus?

The virus has caused alarm because it is still too early to know how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people.

So far, more than 130 people have been killed and thousands more infected – nearly all in China.

Some experts believe the virus is not as dangerous as SARS that killed nearly 800 people in 2002, or MERS which has killed more than 700 people since 2012

How do you treat coronavirus?

As it stands, there is no vaccine for the virus and because it is new, humans have not been able to build immunity to it.

A group of Melbourne researchers have been tasked with finding a vaccine, while China is testing the HIV drug Aluvia as a treatment.
