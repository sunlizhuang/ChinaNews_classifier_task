Even as cities in China are locked down to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, videos have emerged of authorities using drones to warn people to wear masks and even corner those who are disobeying quarantine.

According to a Daily Mail report, vigilantes and government officials are using drones that are fitted with speakers as measures continue to be taken to limit the spread of the coronavirus.

A short clip, shared by a government-run news agency on their official Twitter handle, shows the drone issuing personalised warnings to people who defied prohibitory orders.

The video shows a drone hailing a woman for walking without a mask. Another clip shows a drone reprimanding a man working in the snow and tells him not to work in the snow for a few days. “Get on your cart and go home immediately,” a voice is heard saying.

The video also shows a policewoman using the drone to call out a group of women who were not wearing their masks. Reports said another video doing the rounds on the internet shows drones spraying disinfectants on to the ground.
