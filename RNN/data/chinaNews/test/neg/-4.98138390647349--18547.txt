The World Health Organisation is expected to declare an international public health emergency (PHEIC) after nine people have died from contracting a strain of coronavirus.

The new virus can cause similar symptoms to the common cold , but in more serious cases it can lead to pneumonia, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, kidney failure and death.

To date, nine people have died and there have been 473 confirmed cases of the infection.

Foreign Office officials have also updated advice to any Scots travelling to China, warning the virus had spread to other areas outside the Hubei province.

The illness comes from a new coronavirus , not previously identified in humans, that Chinese health officials said had spread from human to human and may be mutating.

Special measures have been introduced at Heathrow, including air crew observation of passengers, similar to steps taken by Australia and the US to identify potential carriers before they arrive at their destination.

There are three direct flights a week that arrive at Heathrow Airport from Wuhan in China.

As each of these flights land, the captain will tell passengers to let a flight attendant know if they feel unwell. These details will then be passed on to public health teams at the airport who will carry out further checks.

The vast majority of cases have been reported in the Wuhan area of China, a major transportation hub. But the virus has also been identified in the US, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.

The move comes as Health Protection Scotland, together with Public Health England, upgraded the risk to the UK population from coronavirus from "very low" to "low".

Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of the National Infection Service at PHE, said: "This is a new and rapidly evolving situation where information on cases and the virus is being gathered and assessed daily.

“Based on the available evidence, the current risk to the UK is considered low.

“If you are travelling to Wuhan, you should maintain good hand, respiratory and personal hygiene and should avoid visiting animal and bird markets or people who are ill with respiratory symptoms.”

What is coronavirus?

The virus has been identified as a new type or ‘novel’ of coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of pathogens, most of which cause mild respiratory infections such as the common cold. But coronaviruses can also be deadly, SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is caused by a coronavirus and can kill.

The main symptoms will begin as a common cold with fever, cough, shortness of breath but could cause further complications such as pneumonia or kidney failure.

The new virus is transmitted from person to person usually from home, workplace or a health care centre.

The World Health Organisation has said in order to reduce exposure or transmission basic hand and respiratory hygiene should be carried out, as well as safe food practices and avoiding contact with anyone showing symptoms.

No vaccine is available as the virus is in its infancy, however some elements of symptoms can be treated.

Officials believe the origin of the new strain is from a market where wildlife is traded illegally - in particular seafood.
