Tech giant Apple is known for donating to various charities and fundraisers that usually help mankind as a whole. Most recently, before the outbreak, they donated to the fight the spread of wildfires in Australia that has rocked the country for a long time. Even before this, Tim Cook donated close to 5 million dollars to an undisclosed charity. He seems to be the type of person who helps without asking for much, given that Apple is really raking in the dough from all of their products and services. This is only right to give back to his fellow man and especially those who are in need most.

Tim sent a tweet out on Twitter last Saturday pertaining that he will be donating funds towards the fight of the Coronavirus and has since made news all over the internet due to this, the virus has been sowing fear and panic to the world as of now because it appears that nowhere is safe. People now tend to hoard face masks, specifically the n95 variant, which prevents you from 95 percent of pollutants. This is not necessarily required, but it is highly effective in hopes of preventing the disease from spreading from one person to another because the virus is highly contagious and is rumored to be transferable from humans to humans, especially with weak immune systems.
