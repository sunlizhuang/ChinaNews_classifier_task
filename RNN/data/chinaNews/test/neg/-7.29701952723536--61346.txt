Chinese citizens hailed the doctor who blew the whistle on the coronavirus as a martyr on Friday, amid an unprecedented wave of criticism of the Communist Party from within the country.

The doctor’s death triggered an outpouring of grief and anger on social media that appeared to overwhelm censors, with many contrasting the 34-year-old’s bravery with efforts by the Chinese state to censor news of the outbreak.

Selfies of the doctor on his sickbed were widely shared and the story of his death was viewed more than 1.5 billion times on microblogging site Weibo, making it the top read story in the nation.

Some social media users called for Mr Li to receive a state funeral, an honour normally reserved for elite party leaders. Others posted videos of the Les Miserables song, Do you hear the people sing?, an anthem that was taken up by protesters against Chinese influence in Hong Kong.

While censors scrambled to erase online discussion topics like "Wuhan owes Doctor Li Wenliang an apology" and "we want free speech", they were unable to fully stem an avalanche of mourning tinged with uncomfortable questions for the regime.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has cracked down on dissent since taking office in 2013, imprisoning lawyers, journalists, students - and whistleblowers like Mr Li. But even party stalwarts were caught up in the grieving.

Chinese state media accounts, among the first to praise the late Mr Li as a “whistleblower,” have since deleted their original posts from Twitter. “Refusing to listen to your ‘whistling,’ your country has stopped ticking, and your heart has stopped beating,” said Hong Bing, the Shanghai bureau chief of the Communist Party’s official newspaper, People’s Daily, in a post he also promptly deleted.

Wang Gaofei, the chief executive of Weibo - which regularly scrubs the internet on the request of censorship authorities - said “we should be more tolerant of people who post ‘untruthful information’ that aren’t malicious.”

Beijing has tentatively responded to the rush of emotion from its 1.4 billion citizens, announcing the dispatch of a team to investigate the circumstances of Dr Li’s arrest and death. Authorities said they were looking into “relevant issues raised by the public” about the doctor's treatment and it would be “fully investigated”.

Dr Li’s family have also been offered about 785,000 yuan (£87,000) in compensation and an additional 37,000 yuan (£4,000) to cover funeral expenses, according to state media, an unusual move in a country where those who suffer workplace injuries often have little recourse.

Still, many citizens were scornful. “Why did they start the investigation only after he died?” commented one person online. “We already knew that he was wronged for a long time, but why didn't he receive any apologies before he closed his eyes?”

Dr Li became one of the most visible figures in the crisis after after he revealed he had been reproached by Wuhan police last month for “spreading rumours” about the coronavirus. The ophthalmologist, who is survived by a five-year-old son and pregnant wife, urged fellow medics to wear protective gear in a post on social media in which he warned about a cluster of flu-like cases at Wuhan Central Hospital.

His death is "a tragic reminder of how the Chinese authorities’ preoccupation with maintaining 'stability' drives it to suppress vital information about matters of public interest,” said Nicholas Bequelin of Amnesty International, a human rights group.

The social media backlash, which has echoes of the botched emergency response to the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan Province, came as the state continued to insist it had the virus under control. The country's Vice Premier Sun Chunlan stressed that the country was on war footing. “There must be a 24-hour shift pattern. During the wartime condition, there must be no deserters, otherwise they will be forever nailed onto the pillar of historical shame,” Ms Sun said, according to state broadcaster CCTV.

Meanwhile it emerged yesterday that 40 health care workers were infected with the coronavirus at a single Wuhan hospital in January, underscoring the risks to those on the frontlines of the growing epidemic.

One patient who was admitted to the surgical department was presumed to have infected 10 health care workers, according to a paper authored by doctors at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) on Friday.

The crisis poses a massive challenge to President Xi, threatening his basic offer of social and economic security for those that bow to authoritarianism. On Friday, Mr Xi himself told US president Donald Trump that he had “full confidence” the country had the capacity to win the “people’s war” against the deadly coronavirus, in the latest hint that China will continue to resist offers of international help.
