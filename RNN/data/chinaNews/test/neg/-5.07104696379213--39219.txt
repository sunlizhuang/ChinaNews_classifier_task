As of Thursday afternoon, some 8,000 people are infected with the Wuhan coronavirus — and by the time you read this story, the number will probably be closer to 10,000.

There are several cases of human to human transmission outside China.

The number of deaths is currently 170. That number can only go up.

Thursday began with 7,000 people quarantined on a cruise ship in Italy while a couple on board got tested for the coronavirus.

Talk about a recipe for disaster; luckily, the tests were negative.

As frontline health care workers will tell you, the key to controlling this situation is to stay a step ahead, working with whatever scientific evidence is available.

But as Doris Grinspun, CEO of the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario (RNAO) cautioned, “When the evidence changes, the precautions must also change.”

And the evidence is changing every day.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the whole world needs to be on high alert and ready for the cases that will come.

“We are at an important juncture. The chains of transmission must be broken,” said the WHO’s Dr. Michael Ryan.

Here are 10 things that should ensure precautionary measures get stepped up:

• The World Health Organization has declared the Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. This does not mean RUN FOR THE HILLS!!! It means that all countries will work together in a concerted effort to stop this thing from spreading — especially in places where support (financial; health care staff) is needed.

• Three people in Japan (returning home from China) tested positive for the virus. Two of them had no symptoms.

• Australia, the U.S. and others have airlifted some of their citizens out of Wuhan; those people have been quarantined upon their arrival home. Now Federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu has the great good luck of being able to arrange quarantine — precedents, people — for the 150 Canadians about to be removed from Wuhan.

• 2019-nCoV appears to be more infectious but less severe than SARS. The numbers of patients (but not deaths) has already surpassed SARS numbers, and in far less time; meanwhile, MERS (which has a death rate of about 34%) has already surpassed SARS in deaths.

• 2019-nCoV has spread to all of china’s 31 provinces and is now in at least 20 countries around the world; a few countries in Africa are currently testing presumed cases, so that number will rise.

• There have been arrests in Thailand and elsewhere over the spread of false information and rumours designed to create panic. We have nothing to fear but fear itself. To coin a phrase.

• China has extended new year holidays through February 2 to help stem the spread of the virus. Large companies, including Google, Starbucks and Ikea, have temporarily shut down operations in China. Some Americans returning to the U.S. after work visits to China have been invited by their employer to stay home for 14 days before returning to the office in a sort of honour system quarantine. Several car makers have extended the New Year’s work shutdown through February 9, and schools in many cities in China are closed until further notice.

• British Airways, Air Canada, American Airlines and others have suspended all flights into China.

• Russia, Mongolia and North Korea have closed their land borders with China.

• This epidemic will affect manufacturing in China. The country accounts for 20% of global manufacturing, so you can be sure some items (toys, electronics, air conditioners) will be in short supply around the world.
