PETALING JAYA: The operations room at Wisma Putra has been activated and Malaysians stranded in Hubei province, China, can expect to be evacuated “any day” now.

There are currently 80 Malaysians reported to have been stranded after the Chinese government locked down Hubei province, including Wuhan city, due to the novel coronavirus, crippling all travel plans.

A source said the Malaysian government was still in talks with the Chinese government for permission to evacuate Malaysian citizens who are either working or studying in the affected areas.

“The activation of the ops room in Wisma Putra does not mean that the Malaysians in the affected areas will be evacuated right away, but the evacuation can happen any day.

“So, we have to be prepared for when the Chinese government decides to give us the green light to do so, ” said the source.

Other countries too have evacuated their own nationals from China due to the coronavirus outbreak.

On Thursday, Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Abdullah told the media that the National Disaster Management Agency (Nadma) was already prepared.

“The Foreign Ministry, which is part of Nadma, is ready to bring back 80 Malaysian citizens in Hubei province.

“We hope we can bring them home as soon as possible.

“The foreign ministry is discussing with China to bring them back using commercial flights. We will make the announcement about the flight as soon as it is confirmed, ” said Saifuddin.

He also said medical personnel would be flying to China during the evacuation process to monitor the health of Malaysians being brought back.

Saifuddin said those evacuated would be quarantined for a period of time in Malaysia once they returned to ensure that they were not carriers of the virus.
