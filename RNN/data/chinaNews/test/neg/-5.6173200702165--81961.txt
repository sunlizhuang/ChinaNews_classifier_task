(Bloomberg) -- The International Monetary Fund reiterated that it sees a rebound in global growth this year, despite risks of a further spread of the coronavirus that has now killed 2,010 and infected 75,286 people around the world.

Iran said that two elderly patients died, the first fatalities, and the U.S. issued a travel watch for Hong Kong after a second patient died there.

China said it’s considering further measures to shield its economy from the outbreak, including cash infusions and bailouts for the struggling airline industry. The government is planning to take over HNA Group Co. and sell off its airline assets after the virus hampered the debt-loaded conglomerate’s ability to meet financial obligations.

As more people are encouraged to stay at home, a growing number of Chinese private companies have stopped paying staff completely.
