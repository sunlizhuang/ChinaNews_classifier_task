DETROIT -- Disruptions to parts production caused by the coronavirus outbreak in China could threaten output at one of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' plants in Europe within two to four weeks, CEO Mike Manley said.

Automakers and suppliers have extended New Year's holiday shutdowns at their plants in China to Feb. 9, and some have pushed the shutdowns out further.

Hyundai is suspending production in South Korea, the first major automaker to do so outside of China, due to a shortage of wire harness parts from Chinese suppliers.

Toyota is looking closely at inventories of components that are made in China and used in other countries, including Japan, and at the possibility of alternative production, the automaker's purchasing chief, Masayoshi Shirayanagi, told a news conference on Thursday.

FCA so far has not reported production shutdowns at plants outside of China related to the virus outbreak.

Manley said the automaker could potentially see a risk to production at a European plant by the end of February or early March if the disruptions to production and shipment of parts get worse.

FCA did not identify which European plant could be affected.
