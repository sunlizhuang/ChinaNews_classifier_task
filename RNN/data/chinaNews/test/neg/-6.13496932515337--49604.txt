Taipei, Feb. 3 (CNA) More than 200 Taiwanese nationals arrived at Taoyuan International Airport from Wuhan at around 11:40 p.m. Monday in the first evacuation of Taiwanese from the city at the center of a serious coronavirus epidemic.

The passengers, mostly businesspeople who had been stuck in Wuhan after the city was sealed off to contain the spread of the virus, arrived on a charter flight flown by China Eastern Airlines.

The charter flight had previously been scheduled to depart from Wuhan Tienhe International Airport at around 6:50 p.m., but was delayed to around 9:40 p.m. due to the cumbersome process of checking each person's personal information, local media reported.

After arriving at the Taoyuan Airport, the evacuees will be examined in a provisional facility set up on the airport's aircraft maintenance area to determine if they have any symptoms of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), according to Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
